      "body": "Nearly two years after its executive director was hired, and roughly one year after it began to operate in earnest, Boston\u2019s Office of Police Accountability and Transparency has yet to sustain any civilian complaints against the Boston Police Department or to issue subsequent recommendations for disciplinary action, according to a review of city data by GBH News. A data dashboard on the office\u2019s website says that in 2022 OPAT, as the office is widely known, received 56 complaints from civilians about the BPD, which employs more than 2,000 officers, and that 21 of those complaints were deemed lacking. But according to a city spokesperson, that doesn\u2019t include more than two dozen complaints that were quickly dismissed upon initial review rather than being sent to OPAT\u2019s Civilian Review Board for deeper consideration. When those are included, the spokesperson said, the tally of complaints received in 2022 rises to 89.Thirty-five complaints are still pending. The Boston Police Department, which maintains an alternate mechanism through which civilians can file complaints for review by the BPD, told GBH News it received 126 citizen complaints in 2022 and has sustained two of them. As a matter of policy, OPAT does not investigate cases that are already being pursued by the BPD. The abundance of dismissals and lack of sustained complaints are striking \u2014 especially given the high hopes that accompanied Boston\u2019s police-reform push in 2020, after George Floyd\u2019s murder by a Minneapolis police officer spurred outrage and calls for change nationwide. In interviews, OPAT head Stephanie Everett and experts in civilian oversight suggest why that might be the case. Everett, who was appointed as OPAT\u2019s executive director in April 2021 by then-acting Mayor Kim Janey, told GBH News that the members of the Civilian Review Board have only been seated for about a year, and have spent some of that time being trained for their new role. Everett also said more work needs to be done to remind Bostonians that OPAT exists, and pointed out that the office is currently holding a series of community listening sessions aimed at raising its public profile.\u201cThere are still far too many people who don't know that there is a third party that exists for them, in Nubian Square, that they can come into and file a complaint,\u201d Everett said. \u201cThey can call, they can email, they can show up to file a complaint and to just have a conversation about an interaction that they had with the Boston police that they have questions about. And we need to do a better job, in my office, of making sure that they know that we exist.\u201d For some Bostonians, Everett added, simply being informed or reminded of OPAT\u2019s existence may not be enough.\u201cWhile we are not a monolith ... a lot of Black and brown people still don\u2019t trust government, and we are a governmental agency,\u201d she said. \u201cI started this job understanding that trust is going to have to be the foundation, but it\u2019s also a very hard ask. They don\u2019t know who I am. They don\u2019t know who this agency is. ... We\u2019re asking a lot of them to come and trust that, if they file a complaint with us, that it will be fair and thoroughly investigated.\u201d OPAT, which was created by a 2020 city ordinance, is a complex entity charged with reviewing existing and proposed BPD policies, sharing Boston policing data with the public, and monitoring the BPD\u2019s ongoing reform efforts.OPAT also includes and supports the work of the Civilian Review Board, as well as the Internal Affairs Oversight Panel, which subjects the findings of internal BPD investigations to outside review. Another part of OPAT, the three-member OPAT Commission, acts as a de facto board of directors and has the power to issue subpoenas. However, the city spokesperson said cooperation from the BPD has made that unnecessary so far.Under the ordinance that created OPAT, the Civilian Review Board is supposed to make disciplinary recommendations if complaints against BPD employees is upheld, though the Boston police commissioner is not obligated to follow them.In an annual report sent to the mayor in August 2022, Everett said that some civilian allegations of officer misconduct have lacked crucial information, and that some complainants have subsequently cut off contact with OPAT altogether. In that same report, Everett said OPAT\u2019s work had been complicated by a regulatory change made by the Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission \u2014 like OPAT, a product of the reform push that followed Floyd's murder. In June 2022, the POST Commission, as it\u2019s often called, mandated that investigations by police-oversight bodies like OPAT must be completed within 90 days unless an extension is granted. \u201cOur department has deep concerns about how this accelerated timeline will negatively impact our ability to be thorough throughout the course of our investigations,\u201d Everett said in the August 2022 report, adding that she hoped the POST Commission would rethink that requirement. Gianina Irlando, the president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, said a host of factors can lead to entities like OPAT starting their work more slowly than might be expected. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly difficult to start a new agency, especially one that has authority to investigate other agencies,\u201d Irlando said. \u201cYou have staff considerations, you have money considerations, you have authority considerations. And then you\u2019re going to have access situations \u2014 because even with proper authority in a piece of legislation, you don\u2019t necessarily have a good sense of what information is available, how to ask for it, and how to make it work in your own system.\u201d Irlando added that, because a single data point can have multiple explanations, it\u2019s risky to use specific numbers to assess an oversight entity\u2019s performance, either in isolation or comparison to other cities.For example, a low number of civilian complaints could indicate that community members don\u2019t know or trust a particular oversight agency \u2014 or that the police department that agency oversees is doing its job well. Sharon Fairley, a University of Chicago Law School professor who is tracking and analyzing the proliferation of oversight entities nationally, suggested that anyone sizing up the performance of one of those entities evaluate the quality of investigations it conducts. \u201cThe best way to assess how well an agency is performing is to be able to look at the work, and to be able to assess the quality of the work,\u201d Fairley said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s good about what\u2019s happening in Boston is, they are publicizing the reports of their investigations so that the public has the opportunity to say, \u2018OK. This is the evidence that they brought on. This is how they reached their conclusion.\u2019 And then that audience \u2014 the public \u2014 can decide whether or not they agree with that, or felt like that was the wrong outcome.\u201d Cases that have been voted on by the Civilian Review Board can be viewed online at the OPAT web page. They show that Civilian Review Board has consistently voted unanimously on a wide range of cases that seem to run the gamut from frivolous to serious. In one, a complainant claimed they\u2019d been treated rudely after greeting a BPD officer with profanity as part of an independent \u201caudit\u201d of the BPD\u2019s customer service. In another, a bystander contacted OPAT after witnessing an arrest in which they believed officers used excessive force and failed to inform a suspect of his rights. But Fairley, who led the transition from Chicago\u2019s old review board to the new Civilian Office of Police Accountability, also said that continued scrutiny is appropriate. In Chicago, she said, the former agency seemed to be designed well, but never delivered the level of oversight advocates had hoped for.\u201cOn paper, it looked fantastic,\u201d Fairley said. \u201cIt was independent, it had subpoena power, it had jurisdiction over the kind of cases that you want. ... But in execution, it just never developed the way it should have. \u201cYou are right to be watchful,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause we want to make sure these entities as they\u2019re created do sort of develop their wings, and [are] able to actually fulfill the mission they\u2019ve been given over time.\u201d",

      "body": "Boston will distribute $1 million in grants to organizations that provide services for people leaving prisons and jails, part of an effort to help formerly incarcerated people live stable lives, Mayor Michelle Wu announced Tuesday morning. The money will be split among 35 organizations. Nearly all of it \u2014 80 percent \u2014 will go to 29 organizations led by people of color or formerly incarcerated people. More than 3,000 people exit incarceration each year in Boston according to the Office of Returning Citizens. \u201cWrapping around our returning citizens with programming and services is vital to ensuring formerly incarcerated individuals are able to return to their lives and community successfully,\u201d Wu said in a statement. Among the organizations is Justice 4 Housing, an organization that advocates for ending the incarceration of women and girls and works with formerly incarcerated people to find stable housing. \u201cStable housing is the most crucial resource to promoting public safety, public health and circumventing recidivism,\u201d Leslie Credle, the organization\u2019s founder and executive director, said in a statement. \u201cI am living proof that housing is the gateway to a successful reentry. Our programs have provided permanent housing and legal advocacy support for over 100 formerly incarcerated people in our communities.\u201dJos\u00e9 Mass\u00f3, Boston's chief of Human Services, said the highest grant amounts of $60,000 were given to four organizations. Mass\u00f3 said nearly 60 organizations applied for grants and the city hoped that spreading small grants evenly would help build a \"collective network\" of grassroots providers for the future. He said the city recognizes services are needed to support people even before they exit prison. \"As a city agency... partnering with these organizations definitely does allow us to do that,\" Mass\u00f3 said. Dorchester-based New Beginnings Reentry Services, which runs a 10-bed residential program for women coming out of state and federal prison, received a $60,000 grant. It was among a group of organizations made up of returning citizens who wrote to the city in mid-February saying the ORC's grant process disadvantaged smaller community-lead organizations with crucial \"lived experience.\" The organizations said that smaller organizations, especially those led by people typically excluded because of their race or gender, often don\u2019t have business advisors or grant writers to help them navigate the process. Founder Stacey Borden, who is Black and herself exited prison 13 years ago, said it took her two years to set up the residential program, and she continues to struggle to pay expenses, including insurance and salary for employees. She welcomed the grant funding, but said smaller organizations led by people of color, and which have \"direct experience\" with the populations they are helping, will need further support and alliances with the city to continue their work. \"It's all just trying to connect. How do you handle community? You're got to create these allies, right?\" Borden said. Baystate Reentry Network, which works exclusively to help men and women who have been previously convicted of a sex offense and have to register upon their release, received a $10,000 grant. Executive Director Bill Canavan said helping formerly incarerated people ultimately helps everyone in society. \"The cost of someone being homeless, the cost of someone being incarcerated, the cost of someone going through the court system, the assignment of counsel, the judges, the jury, transportation. It goes on and on,\" Canavan said, \"There are so many hidden costs to crime that I believe, anyway, all taxpayers should be interested in.\"",

      "body": "Gov. Maura Healey is proposing a $742 million package of tax cuts in the state budget she will file Wednesday, offering relief for parents, renters and seniors alongside other tax reforms. Healey's plan shares common ground with the tax proposal former Gov. Charlie Baker could not get over the finish line his final year in office, and it features some other measures that have been kicking around Beacon Hill for years, like a new live theater tax credit and changes to the way locally produced hard cider is taxed. Announced Monday morning at the Demakes Family YMCA in Lynn, the tax package is centered around a child and family tax credit that Healey touted on the campaign trail. Healey's office said 700,000 taxpayers would benefit from the $600 per-dependent credit, helping them keep up with climbing costs for child and senior care. The child and family tax credit, for children under 13, people with disabilities and senior dependents age 65 and up, combines two interrelated existing benefits \u2014 the Household Dependent Tax Credit and Dependent Care Tax Credit \u2014 while removing the cap on dependents, and increasing the benefits. At a cost to the state of $458 million for the next budget year, it's the single largest piece of Healey's proposal. Healey said she and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll are filing this package for people \"who are struggling to get by as the cost of living continues to skyrocket past them \u2013 the family watching their grocery bill grow each week, the young mom who wants to return to her dream job but can\u2019t afford child care, the recent college graduate who can\u2019t afford both his rent and student loan payments, the seniors who want to keep the home where they raised their family.\"Along with the child and family credit, the plan would increase the rental deduction from $3,000 to $4,000, and double to $2,400 a credit for low-income seniors paying property taxes or rent. In a pair of moves Healey described as ways to make Massachusetts more competitive with other states, the bill would use credits to eliminate the estate tax \u2014 which currently kicks in at $1 million \u2014 for estates valued up to $3 million, and cut the tax rate on short-term capital gains to 5% from 12%Last year, Baker filed a nearly $700 million tax plan that also would have boosted credits for dependent and child care, increased the rental deduction, doubled credits for seniors, reformed the estate tax and cut the short-term capital gains tax. The House and Senate each passed different tax relief bills last year, never agreeing on specifics. Ultimately, legislative leaders shelved the bills after realizing the state would be returning $3 billion in excess revenues to residents, pledging to revisit the issue this year. Senate President Karen Spilka, at the start of the session in January, called for lawmakers to pass progressive tax relief \u201csoon.\u201d Tax policy bills, though, must start in the House, where Speaker Ron Mariano has talked about watching the state\u2019s fiscal picture before acting. Healey\u2019s tax package would also: expand the list of occupations that qualify for apprenticeship tax credits, and double the statewide cap on those credits to $5 million;increase the cap on Housing Development Incentive Program credits, with the goal of producing more market-rate housing in gateway cities;increase the cap to $8 million for the state's dairy tax credit, which Massachusetts Dairy Farmers Association President David Shepard said would \"greatly help offset the forecasted difficult times ahead in dairy costs of production and pricing\";exempt employer assistance with student loan repayment from taxable income;expand tax-deductible commuter transit benefits to include regional transit passes and bike commuter expenses;double the credit for lead paint abatement, and double the maximum credit for septic tank repair or replacement in a primary residence, and;extend the expiring brownfields tax credit for cleanup of contaminated properties through 2028.",

When is the marathon? How long has it taken place?This year\u2019s Boston Marathon is on Monday, April 17, 2023.The Boston Marathon is the oldest continually run marathon in the world, and considered by many to be the most prestigious. It started in 1897 with just 18 people, and now tens of thousands of people from around the world participate each year. This year will be the 127th marathon. It is usually run on the third Monday in April, which in Massachusetts is Patriots\u2019 Day \u2014 the state holiday that commemorates the battles of Lexington and Concord during the Revolutionary War. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the marathon, and last year marked the first time in three years that the marathon was run on Patriots\u2019 Day. This year also marks the 10th anniversary of the bombing at the Boston Marathon, when explosions at the finish line killed three people and injured hundreds more. The city will commemorate the anniversary with a remembrance event and service projects for One Boston Day.What is the marathon route?The 26.2-mile route starts in Hopkinton and makes its way through suburbs, all the way to the finish line in Boston. Although it starts slightly downhill, the notorious hills around Newton make it one of the more difficult marathons for distance runners. After setting off along East Main Street in Hopkinton, runners follow Route 135 as they traverse through Ashland, Framingham, Natick and Wellesley. There, the marathon follows Route 16 and Commonwealth Avenue through the hills of Newton and up Heartbreak Hill. It turns onto Chestnut Hill Avenue through Cleveland Circle and takes Beacon Street into Brookline, then through Kenmore Square. As they come into Back Bay down Commonwealth Avenue, runners take a right on Hereford Street and a left on Boylston Street, and finally cross the finish line in Copley Square. How do runners qualify for the Boston Marathon?To run the Boston Marathon, athletes must qualify by beating a certain time at another major marathon, a time that\u2019s determined by their gender and age. That strict qualification requirement sets Boston apart from other worldwide races, many of which have lotteries for runners who don\u2019t meet qualifying times. Registration happened in September. The other way to run the marathon is as part of the charity program, which requires you to raise substantial money for a local charity: a minimum of $5,000.Who\u2019s running the Boston Marathon?This year, 30,000 runners are expected to make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square. The Boston Athletic Association, the nonprofit behind the race, said that this year will be the \u201cfastest and most decorated Boston Marathon across all of our divisions in race history.\u201d The Boston Marathon attracts some of the biggest global stars in running, and this year is no exception. Among the elite athletes on the men\u2019s side are: Eliud Kipchoge, a runner from Kenya who\u2019s taking on Boston for the first time after winning two Olympic gold medals for the marathon; Evans Chebet, the reigning 2022 champion from Kenya; and Benson Kipruto, the 2021 winner who is also from Kenya.In the men\u2019s wheelchair division, American Daniel Romanchuk is back to defend his title. He will be challenged by Marcel Hug, the reigning Paralympic marathon gold medalist and world-record holder.On the women\u2019s side, Desi Linden, the American who won in 2018, will be running along with previous champions Kenya\u2019s Edna Kiplagat and Ethiopia\u2019s Atsede Baysa. The women\u2019s wheelchair division field will feature Switzerland\u2019s Manuela Sch\u00e4r, who has won Boston four times; Australia\u2019s Madison de Rozario, the 2020 Paralympic gold medalist; and American Tatyana McFadden, who has won Boston five times. The Para division will feature Lisa Thompson and Liz Willis, who both won titles in their division last year. How much money do athletes win?The top 10 men and women finishers in the open division will be awarded prize money, ranging from $5,500 for those in 10th place to $150,000 for the man and woman who come in first. The top three men and women in the masters division, for runners over age 40, are awarded $1,500, $2,500 and $5,000 for third, second and first place, respectively.In the wheelchair division, the top 10 men and women finishers will also receive prizes, ranging from $750 to a top award of $25,000.This will be the third year that prize money will be awarded to the top three male and female finishers in each of the five Para Athletics Divisions for athletes with vision, upper-limb and lower-limb impairments. The top racers in each division will receive $1,500, the second-place finishers $750 and the third-place finishers $500.There are also $50,000 prizes for any athlete who sets a new course record in either the open or wheelchair divisions.What changes are being made this year?This year marks the first year that runners will be able to register as nonbinary for the in-person race, following races like Chicago and New York that have previously added that option. Athletes who register as nonbinary for the Boston Marathon will not be eligible for division prizes. \"So I think we can take this moment to celebrate, but we also have to recognize that it isn't the end, there's still so much ahead of us,\" Jake Fedorowski, the author of the \u201cThe Guide to Non-Binary Inclusion in Running,\u201d told GBH News when the policy was announced in September. \"I'm confident that Boston is committed to that work \u2026 this is just kind of one of those initial but still very important steps.\"In January, the BAA announced a new policy that will allow pregnant and postpartum runners who qualified for the marathon to defer to future years. \u201cWomen who are entered in a BAA race and want to expand their family will be able to do just that without giving up a chance to participate at a future BAA event,\u201d said Jack Fleming, the president and CEO of the BAA. Continuing its policy from last year, runners from Russia and Belarus are not allowed to enter the race under their country.How can I watch?You can watch the marathon at home by tuning into WCVB channel 5. Coverage starts at 4 a.m. and goes through the evening. It will also air on ESPN from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.Athletes leave Hopkinton in waves, starting around 9 a.m. and through 11 a.m., so there is plenty of action all day. The lead men and women are expected to cross the finish line around 11:45 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., respectively.Spectators are encouraged to line the 26.2-mile course. Among the more popular viewing spots are the Scream Tunnel at Wellesley College, Heartbreak Hill, which culminates around mile 21 at Boston College, and of course, the finish line on Boylston Street. If you\u2019re in the city, the MBTA is the best way to get around that day. Check and make sure individual stations are open when it gets close to Marathon Monday: the Copley stop on the Green Line, for one, will be closed all day. Spectators should expect to go through security checkpoints to access certain areas, like Copley Square.If you want to track someone along the route, the BAA puts out a free BAA Racing App that you can use to track their bib number as they make their way to Boston. The 2023 version will be launched sometime in April. For more details on watching in person, check out the BAA\u2019s spectator guide.What other events will be happening that weekend? The BAA 5k will be held on the morning of Saturday, April 15, and is expected to draw 10,000 runners to downtown Boston. Runners start on Charles Street between the Public Garden and Common, and make a loop through Back Bay. April 15 also marks One Boston Day, which has been observed every year since the 2013 bombings.Keeping with tradition, the Red Sox will have a home game on April 17, against the Los Angeles Angels. The game starts at 11:10 a.m.",

      "body": "A day after the owner of a Boston-area pizzeria chain was charged with forced labor and abuse of an immigrant worker in federal court, local advocates say it\u2019s likely there are many more exploited workers in our region who go unidentified. Audrey Richardson, a managing attorney with the nonprofit Greater Boston Legal Services, said the organization is \u201cfamiliar with the case.\u201d She frequently sees similar situations of exploited workers too afraid to seek help. She said a lot of undocumented workers feel like they can\u2019t come forward because of threats of deportation and losing their livelihoods\u201c[These cases] might not rise to the level of being just so violent, and so off the charts for such a long period of time,\" Richardson told GBH News. \"But the same elements of employers who want to intimidate and threaten workers to take advantage of them and to keep them working and to not pay them what they're owed are there.\" Stavros Papantoniadis, owner of Stash\u2019s Pizza in Dorchester and Roslindale, was arrested Thursday on allegations that he physically assaulted undocumented employees, withheld wages, forced workers to work over 80 hours a week for little or no pay and threatened them with deportation. One alleged victim detailed claims of being kicked, choked and assaulted so severely that he had to have all of his teeth removed, according to a federal affidavit. He said Papantoniadis yelled Muslim slurs as he was beaten and threatened his life. The man said he worked there for nearly 14 years, partly in fear of being deported.Papantoniadis couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. He has yet to enter a plea and is being held pending a detention hearing on Monday. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. Mohammed Missouri, executive director of Jetpac \u2014 a Cambridge-based nonprofit seeking to elect American Muslims \u2014 says the case also reflects anti-Muslim bigotry that contributes to people not seeking help. The organization refers individuals in the Muslim community who experience workplace harassment to the Council on American-Islamic Relations \u2013 Massachusetts and other advocacy and civil rights groups for resources.\u201cIf you feel like you're in a situation that can't be necessarily helped by you speaking out, you're not going to speak out,\u201d he said. This is the first case of forced labor filed by U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins\u2019 office since she took the job last year. Since then, she has created a human trafficking unit focused on sex and labor violations. Rollins called the allegations \u201chorrific\u201d in a press release on Thursday but said the problem of forced labor is widespread. \u201cLabor trafficking is real and happening every day in Massachusetts and beyond,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cWe are working hard to expose this disturbing crime and to hold those that abuse and traffic people accountable.\u201dThe problem of forced labor, often hidden in plain sight, has been the topic of an ongoing investigation by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting. GBH News reporters have spoken with restaurant and construction workers and domestic cleaners, among others, who have detailed working long hours for little or no pay, who are fearful of deportation, abuse and even homelessness.Audrey Richardson encouraged workers at Stash\u2019s Pizza and other businesses who think they\u2019re dealing with labor violations to reach out to Greater Boston Legal Services and community worker centers that work with immigrants. She said there have been recent efforts at the federal level to better help victims.In January, the Department of Homeland Security announced a new process that grants \u201cdeferred action\u201d for workers who are witnesses or could potentially be witnesses in a labor dispute being investigated by a government agency. The status allows immigrants to work legally and protects them from deportation. \u201cIt really does allow workers the feeling that they can come forward, that they're protected, that they will have the ability to come out of the shadows and work lawfully,\u2019\u2019 Richardson said. It is unclear if any of the alleged victims in this case accessed that new process, but according to the affidavit, Department of Homeland Security agents helped several immigrant workers at Stash\u2019s Pizza acquire immigration benefits, including \u201ccontinued presence,\u201d which allows them to remain in the U.S. legally under human trafficking laws. The Department of Homeland Security also signed a supportive document, called certification, that helps one of the victims in their application for a T-visa, which is an option for victims of forced labor and sex trafficking. Certain victims can remain in the U.S. legally for four years if the federal government grants that benefit.",

Elizabeth Warren balked on GBH's Boston Public Radio when asked if President Joe Biden should pick Kamala Harris to run with him again in 2024. The story blew up, then faded away after Warren issued a clarification saying she fully supported Biden's and Harris's reelection. But now it's back with a vengeance, thanks to CNN reporting that found Warren has called Harris twice to apologize and Harris still hasn't called her back.Whether Warren intended to jab at Harris is debatable, but one thing is certain: Harris has been under scrutiny in recent months, and the portraits painted of her performance as vice president have generally been unflattering. Adam Reilly is joined by GBH News' Callie Crossley and the Boston Globe's Ren\u00e9e Graham to discuss what's driving that negativity, the role Harris may have played in the Democrats' stronger-than-expected performance in the midterms, and whether the negative narrative surrounding Harris might also reflect deep-seated anxiety about Biden.

      "body": "Communities across the nation are beginning the process of acknowledging the scope of the injustices done to Black people throughout their histories, and many are developing local initiatives for reparations to balance the scales of centuries of harm.The first week of Black History Month, from inside Beacon Hill\u2019s Museum of African American History, Mayor Michelle Wu unveiled the members of the city\u2019s new Task Force on Reparations, a group that will study the scale of injustices done to its Black residents throughout history and what actions could begin to repair what has been done.The task force, which comprises a multigenerational group of historians, activists and students, is planning on meeting soon to discuss their ideas on how to approach the complexity of reparatory justice. The questions they seek to explore are nuanced and the stakes are high, and as they do the meticulous work of documentation and reflection over the next year, the city will wait to look with a careful eye at their conclusions. How will the task force properly account for such a lofty history of subjugation and discrimination? How will they sufficiently repair the generational trauma caused by a legacy of enslavement and racism? This week on Basic Black, how Boston\u2019s task force will try to answer these questions about the accountability for reparations, and how other similar councils across the country are addressing the same complex issues. Callie Crossley will be joined by: George \u201cChip\u201d Greenidge, task force member, and founder and director of Greatest MINDS; Carrie Mays, task force member, and student at UMass Boston; and Traci Griffith, director of the Racial Justice Program at ACLU Massachusetts.

      "body": "Last year, a neo-Nazi hate group displayed a banner at the South Boston St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade. This year, elected and public safety officials have tried to make sure that does not happen again. Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, who represents South Boston, joined GBH\u2019s Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston to talk about how the city is preparing for the parade. This transcript has been lightly edited. Ed Flynn: We have absolutely zero tolerance for hate groups trying to intimidate anybody. We want a parade that's safe and welcoming to all. We celebrate our differences. We celebrate our diversity. But for hate organizations to come into Boston, we have zero tolerance for them, and there's no place at all for them in this city. Paris Alston: The white supremacist group in NSC-131 made an appearance and had that banner at last year's parade. What would exactly stop someone from doing that exact same thing again? I mean, anyone could show up and display a banner. So how do you make sure that that doesn't happen? And what's going to happen if it does? Flynn: Well, I think that's the critical question you are asking. And we all support the First Amendment. But when people come in to a parade, into a public gathering, with a message of hate, a message of division and violence, that is despicable, and that's dividing people, and that is causing harm. And that's not about the First Amendment. That's about intimidating people of color, immigrant neighbors, the LGBTQ community. So certainly it's a balancing act, but as far as I'm concerned, the First Amendment doesn't apply when you are trying to intimidate people, you are trying to discriminate against people. We have seen a rise in hate crimes here in Boston, the most progressive city in the country. We have seen hate groups march through downtown Boston and through the Chinatown area, a large AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] community. We also have a large LGBT community in downtown Boston. We have seen hate groups cause disruption and chaos at various hospitals, including Children's Hospital, that are assisting LGBTQ patients. We also have seen hate groups intimidating medical professionals of color at one of the prominent Boston hospitals. So it's important that we work together \u2014 not just the police, not just civil rights groups, but everyday residents of Boston. And when we see some type of demonstration beginning, or any type of intimidation, we need to call police. Let the police know about it. We also have to strengthen our civil rights units. We need to document these incidents, investigate them and educate the public. Alston: Council president, I also have to acknowledge that there has been evidence of at least some sort of divisions that are happening within the City Council throughout the past year. And of course, that has included a verbal attack that Councilor Frank Baker made on Councilor Liz Breadon, who emigrated from Northern Ireland. Now, I know we're talking about two very different things, right? But I know that people have made links between those things, and we know that what happens with our leadership in this city can sometimes be a reflection of what's going on between everyday citizens. And so what have the conversations been like among the council when we talk about how we are respecting, when we're in conversation and in discourse with one another? Flynn: Well, I think, Paris, that there has to be more civility in government, in politics. I see it on both sides that people \u2014 even good people of good will \u2014 are doing and saying things that they normally would not say. But it's about recognizing our differences, respecting each other, knowing that we're not always going to agree with each other, but we have to respect each other. And if we don't respect each other in government, residents across the city, or residents across the state, will see it. When elected officials are not acting appropriately and being disrespectful, it almost is an invitation for our citizens to act that way again. So we have to get back to the basics of treating people with respect and dignity. And that starts with us right here. Alston: So lastly, council president, we've talked about a lot of heavy stuff here, but we also have to remember that the Southie parade is meant to be a joyous occasion, right? So what are you looking forward to about this year's parade? Flynn: What I like most about the parade is we celebrate not just the contributions and sacrifices of the Irish, but also the veterans' community and our military families. I had the opportunity to serve 25 years in the United States Navy. Alston: Thank you for your service. Flynn: Yes, thank you. And in my neighborhood in South Boston, we have the highest number of men that were killed in Vietnam. It's a happy time for the parade, but it's also a time when we acknowledge the incredible sacrifices made by our military families, including our Gold Star families as well. I know they'll be at the parade and it's an opportunity to acknowledge their presence and to thank them for their incredible service and sacrifice to our country.",

      "body": "New data suggests that Massachusetts is the most expensive state for older people living alone, meaning they\u2019re more likely to face economic insecurity than older singles in any other state. Jan Mutchler, director of the Gerontology Institute at UMass Boston and creator of the Elder Index, joined GBH\u2019s All Things Considered host Arun Rath to break down the results of the study. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: First, can you tell us a bit more about the Elder Index \u2014 what it is, what it measures and how it\u2019s calculated?Jan Mutchler: Of course. The Elder Index is a measurement of how much it takes for older singles and couples to live independently in their own homes. We generate a bare-bones budget. It\u2019s a very stripped-down budget, only covers housing, food, travel \u2014 and not the fun kind of travel, just getting around to the doctors and grocery store and travel expenses \u2014 medical expenses, and a small additional amount for added things like home goods and things like that. So we calculate this bare-bones lifestyle county by county for the entire United States. And we\u2019ve been doing this here at UMass Boston Gerontology for about 12 years. Rath: As we mentioned, Massachusetts ranks first in the most expensive states for older people living alone, even ahead of New York and California. Do we have a sense of why? And also could you put that in perspective for us, give us a sense of scale? Mutchler: A lot of times, in these conversations, it\u2019s helpful to think about the values for older renters in good health because many people do rent. It\u2019s also a common transition as people get older for them to move out of owned homes and into a renter situation. So looking at those numbers, the value of the Elder Index for Massachusetts singles is just over $37,000 a year. That compares to the average U.S. value of about $29,000 a year. So you\u2019re looking at $8,000 a year more being required for older singles to stay in their homes in Massachusetts. As you said, that is higher than Hawaii, New York and California \u2014 it\u2019s the highest in the country. Rath: To make an obvious point, that\u2019s a huge deal if you\u2019re living on a fixed income. Tell us a bit more about this slice of the older population we\u2019re talking about: people who are living alone. Do the demographics of this group, say the measures of race or gender, do they track with the general population? Or are they more predominantly one thing or another?Mutchler: When you\u2019re looking at the older population living alone, you are disproportionately looking at white women. That\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re all white women by any means \u2014 but essentially, women do live longer than men, so the older we\u2019re looking in the age range, the more women we\u2019re seeing relative to men. White people also have higher longevity, longer life on average, than many other race and ethnic groups. They do live longer than African American elders, for instance.However, a lot of the reasons we see a disproportionate share of white people living alone relative to other groups is that other groups \u2014 the Latinx, Black and Asian populations \u2014 are more likely to be living with their children. Many of them do live alone, but a larger share lives with other people than is the case in the white population.Rath: Do we have a sense that this group, the older people who are living alone, is growing as we have an aging population?Mutchler: Yes. Over many, many decades, we can track the growth in the percentage of older people living alone. A lot of that is a function of outliving spouses. It\u2019s also a function of many people not forming marital relationships at all. It\u2019s a function of a sort of cultural norm where independence is highly valued in many groups; a lot of people feel that they should be living alone, that that\u2019s expected, and that\u2019s a desired outcome for them. But that does create these financial problems that we\u2019re documenting with the Elder Index. It\u2019s expensive to live all by oneself and cover all of your expenses, and the older you get, the higher those expenses may be. You can experience an increase in the health care expenses as you get older, and you may require more medications, more doctor\u2019s visits and that kind of thing.Again, our report focuses largely on people who are renters. Especially in Massachusetts, but all the way across the country, the cost of renting has just spiraled and has hit older people very hard \u2014 as anyone who\u2019s renting. But it has had a huge impact on older people. Rath: What you just said makes this next question even harder, and that\u2019s: What can be done about this? I mean, this ties into things like housing prices, which are hard to deal with, and we\u2019re dealing with it in a lot of ways across the board. Are there any kinds of interventions, policies that can help alleviate these burdens for older people living alone?Mutchler: There are things that that we can do, as a society and as a state, and things that families and individuals can do. The challenge to some extent is that what we're talking about is: a lot of the people who have incomes falling below the Elder Index are people who used to be middle class. They used to be okay, but with time, as they age and have lost a spouse ... and their income really has shrunk, and they\u2019re no longer able to really cover this bare-bones budget that we calculate through the Elder Index. Some of those people will have incomes so low that they may be eligible for things like SNAP benefits, subsidies for health insurance, subsidized housing, things of that nature. Many of them will not have incomes that are low enough. They\u2019ll be too low to really support an adequate lifestyle, but they won\u2019t be low enough for some of the big programs that we\u2019re aware of. They might be eligible for other programs, like fuel assistance and other sorts of supports. Everybody \u2014 whether their income is very low, or they\u2019re just struggling in that middle place below the Elder Index but above the poverty line \u2014 can find out about programs that they might be eligible for through their senior centers. Every community in Massachusetts has a council on aging, and they can refer you to somebody who would give you information about what you might be eligible for if you\u2019re struggling.",

      "body": "Updated March 21 at 6:17 p.m.Residents of the South Coast are bracing for the loss of their only bus service to Boston. DATTCO, the company that operates the routes, has announced it is going to shut down its bus line on April 16, which brings riders from Fall River, New Bedford, Fairhaven, Dartmouth and Taunton to South Station and Copley Square. \u201cThis is a decision we have struggled with for several months as we looked at options to both reduce our operating costs and increase fares substantially,\u201d DATTCO wrote in a statement Friday. \u201cUnfortunately, we have not found a solution that would provide a cost-effective commute option while overcoming the deficit we have been experiencing for several years.\u201d While local officials are hoping for a stopgap in service before the new South Coast Commuter Rail starts late this year, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation says it doesn\u2019t have the money to support the bus. \u201cAs much as MassDOT would like to see the commuter service continue, it does not have an existing funding source to support these service operations and is unable to provide any assistance at this time,\u201d MassDOT\u2019s Judith Riley told GBH News in a statement Tuesday evening. According to MassDOT, 30 to 60 riders take the bus every day. New Bedford state Rep. Antonio Cabral said he was shocked to learn that the service was being terminated from a constituent \u2014 and not from DATTCO or the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. \u201cThis is very important for my constituency,\u201d Cabral said. \u201cObviously, this is the only way they can commute to Boston if they can\u2019t get up there with their own car. It doesn't make sense. Right now, we have no alternative.\u201d The new South Coast Commuter Rail service will serve New Bedford and Fall River, but officials want assurance that there will be an alternative until then for those who can\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to, drive to Boston. New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell said he was \u201ctroubled\u201d by DATTCO\u2019s decision to cancel service altogether, and with little warning, in a statement Tuesday. \u201cResidents are now scrambling for alternate transit options,\u201d he said. \u201cEqually inexcusable is DATTCO\u2019s lack of any engagement with the City, which would have been open to discussions regarding the possible takeover of affected routes by another carrier in a way that provides for a seamless transition.\u201d Mitchell says he has reached out to Massachusetts\u2019 Transportation Secretary Gina Fiandaca to find a solution.

      "body": "Spring is here, which means farm workers at the Haley House Thornton Street Urban Farm and Community Gardens are looking at seeds. \u201cIt is the first day of spring, and we are plotting and planning what we're going to be growing this season,\u201d said Jay Vilar, program director at the Haley House. \u201cA lot of the work that we're doing now is about just getting ready for the season. So we're doing a lot of our seed ordering. We're doing our starts at the Dudley Greenhouse and we're starting to get our deliveries of soil and compost ready to go.\"Haley House uses its Roxbury farm to provide both food and education, Vilar said. The nonprofit runs a cafe, soup kitchen and other initiatives that connect food and community. The three-quarter acre farm grows fresh produce and allows students and neighbors to tend to the soil. \u201cWhat we're really waiting for before we can actually, truly get into the ground, is make sure there's no more frost this season,\u201d Vilar said. Right now, seeds that will eventually become kale, collard greens and tomatoes are getting their start at the Dudley Greenhouse on Brook Avenue in Roxbury. \u201cIn order for your crop to get a head start, a lot of the initial work is just about getting them ready,\u201d he said. Most produce won\u2019t go into the ground until mid-May, Vilar said. \u201cTypically when you start to put things into the ground and it\u2019s safe is around Mother's Day, that second weekend of May when you know that the weather has officially turned and you're able to grow things in the ground and everything can survive,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things that you can start early on \u2014 like peas \u2014 that can live and germinate as the temperature is still a little cooler.\u201d Some plants, like tomatoes, will only give one harvest this year. Others, like spinach, arugula and other leafy greens, may yield two harvests if the growing season is long enough. That all depends on when the first frosts come next fall, Vilar said. The food that Haley House grows will eventually go to local seniors, the nonprofit's soup kitchen, a nutritional cooking program called Take Back the Kitchen, and to re-entry programs for returning citizens. Flowers and ornamental plants, too, will soon be ready to plant \u2014 but not quite yet. Mark Saidnawey, who with his niece Laynie Saidnawey are third- and fourth-generation owners of Pemberton Garden Services in Cambridge and Belmont, said now\u2019s the time to get everything but the plants ready to go. \u201cWe\u2019re itching to get outside,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are outside working now, putting all of our non-living items out for sale \u2014 all the pottery and all the gardening supplies and soils and compost \u2014 so we can just press a button and say 'Bring us plants,' and we're ready to go.\u201dThough most people in the Boston area will start seeing daytime highs around 50 this week, Saidnawey advised against planting flowers until nighttime lows rise above freezing. People who want a bit of color outside their homes can put flower pots outdoors, so long as they remember to bring them back inside at night to protect from the cold. \u201cI appreciate that it's the first day of spring, but we go by what the weather forecast is: low temps, high temps, precipitation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be the week that we'll start to bring in our early spring plants. We'll get some pansies and other cold crop flowers they can maybe take below freezing. But it's still early. You got to be careful.\u201dMost local nurseries will soon begin to sell bulbs \u2014 tulips, daffodils and hyacinths, to name a few \u2014 that will be ready to go into the ground. \u201cPansies are usually the first flowering outdoor plant to come in and safe enough to put outside, because they can take temperatures in the 20s,\u201d Saidnawey said. \u201cThey'll get a little beat up at night, but they'll bounce back as soon as it warms up above freezing.\u201dPerennials can go in the ground in the coming weeks too, he said: \u201cHellebore is a very popular early spring plant that you'll see starting to bloom in people's gardens soon.\u201dTrees and shrubs native to New England can go in during the first week of April, he said. By the middle of April, it\u2019s time for cold crop vegetables, like parsley and lettuce.\u201cBy the third week in April, we have most everything for the season, but we also have to just keep an eye on those temperatures,\u201d he said. It's also time to think about humane ways to keep bunnies and other critters from nibbling at gardens. \u201cIf you're like us and our gardening clients, the rabbits are going crazy eating the foliage of tulips and other crocus,\u201d Saidnawey said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a good time to put down some type of rabbit repellent, and you can pick that up at your local garden center. Maybe you can go online and find a little home remedy to make.\u201d People without outdoor space can also get started on container gardens, he said. Leftover containers from last season are still just fine, Saidnawey said. They may need some fresh soil, a bit of compost and new plants.\u201cOne of the greatest joys is to watch people walk into this place with a smile on their face,\u201d Saidnawey said. \u201cI mean, if you're walking into a plant store without a smile on your face, something's wrong.\u201d",

      "body": "On the toasty morning of July 15, 1891, four middle-aged women met at Rowes Wharf in Boston, boarded a boat and set sail for one of the outermost harbor islands: Great Brewster. At the time, its rugged landscape was home to little more than a smattering of structures \u2014 including \"huts of refuge\" for potential shipwreck survivors \u2014 and a single cow that roamed the island. The women were leaving their husbands, children and responsibilities behind for more than two weeks in search of adventure and the joy of female friendship. Their provisions included food, art supplies, literature and one leather-bound journal. And it\u2019s that journal that, over a century later, mesmerized Boston-based author Stephanie Schorow when she came across the volume in Harvard\u2019s Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America.\u201cBut there was one big problem with it,\u201d Schorow said. \u201cWe knew the identity of one of the women in the diary. But we didn\u2019t know the other three women. Now, we had their photos \u2014 but we did not have their names.\u201dThe journal detailed the cold corned beef they ate and the poetry they read by moonlight. It recorded the tides and the flora of the island. Photographs, a novelty back then, showed their rustic cottage. It was the site where they pitched a hammock and hoisted an American flag \u2014 which, at the time, had only 43 stars. They adopted their own playful language \u2014 a mix of Shakespearean and swashbuckler \u2014 sprinkling in the word \u201cYe\u201d for flair. \u201cThe women in the journal were only identified by their nicknames: The Autocrat, the Aristocrat, the Acrobat and the Scribe \u2014 which, when you get down to it, are kind of weird nicknames,\u201d Schorow said.One of the women, whose moniker was \u201cYe Veracious Scribe,\u201d had already been identified as Helen Augusta Whittier, a Lowell resident whose name was found on a handwritten note in the journal. Schorow tried to focus on her other projects: she\u2019s the author of several books on Boston\u2019s history. But the journal \u2014 and the peculiar women who created it \u2014 kept returning to her mind, and the hunch that its creators had their own contributions to make to modern-day scholarship.Schorow made a few phone calls to solicit help identifying the women.A collection of about 10 people, almost exclusively older women, stepped forward to volunteer their research skills in 2020, when the pandemic kept them all home. Over Zoom and emails, they began by transcribing the journal, which, due to the abundance of \u201cye\u201ds and antiquated penmanship, wasn\u2019t simple.\u201cThey don\u2019t teach cursive to students anymore. But we\u2019re old gals. So we wrote in cursive. We could decipher it,\u201d Schorow said. \u201cBut even then, there were some parts we\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying here.\u2019\u201dOnce the journal was transcribed, the next task was to distinguish which woman \u2014 their names still unknown \u2014 wrote which entries. One of the investigators, Allison Andrews, had previous experience evaluating handwriting and cataloguing photographs. She noticed that some of the writers used periods, and some wrote with a dash. The group stitched together census records, newspaper clippings and public records from genealogy websites. And now, after years of research, they feel confident they have identified all four women: Helen Francis Ray French was the \u201cYe Autocrat.\u201d The daughter of a clothing manufacturer in Lowell, she later ran a lodging house with her husband. \u201cYe Gentle Aristocrat\u201d was Sarah Elizabeth \u201cLizzie\u201d Dean Adams, a founding member of two humanitarian clubs in New England.\u201cYe Artistic Acrobat\u201d was Isabella Coburn, a well-known painter who studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and what\u2019s now the Massachusetts College of Art. Coburn died of heart failure four years after the trip. And the trip\u2019s ringleader, nicknamed \u201cYe Veracious Scribe,\u201d was Helen Augustua Whittier. She never married and ran her family\u2019s textile mill in Lowell, before founding a Boston newsletter for women and becoming a leader in New England\u2019s women\u2019s suffrage movement. \u201cWe can only suppose that they were trying to say to the world, \u2018We can do it ourselves. Women can do it ourselves,\u2019\u201d Schorow said.Journal entries describe how they foraged and fished: After dinner, 2 of them, with rubbers, pails and spoons, left to go get clams. With regret, they left a ruddy sunset and soon found their friends with long face and cut hands...but no clams.Yet another page has a small, exquisite watercolor painting of a lobster with the handwritten caption: \u201cYe hot lobster.\u201dProfessor John Stilgoe, who teaches the history of landscape at Harvard University, first discovered the journal in a used book store while on a bike ride in Cape Ann in 1999. On the counter inside, the leather-bound volume lay open, its pages an organic collection of cursive writing, watercolors and early photographs depicting women on a remote coast. \u201cI took one look at it and was staggered by its beauty,\u201d he said. He pledged to the bookseller that Harvard would buy it. \u201cAnd put down my own credit card and told him if Harvard didn\u2019t buy it, I would buy it.\u201d Harvard pounced, buying the volume sight-unseen. Stilgoe said he was not surprised the women knew how to describe, draw and paint the plants and seascape around them: He\u2019s researched how educated American women in that era studied Latin and botany. But Stilgoe\u2019s discovery at the bookstore was not the first time the book had been rescued. Ann Marie Allen is a retired chemist and theologian who helped solve the mystery. She said the journal has had several close calls, starting with that inaugural trip to the rustic cottage more than a century ago.\u201cWhen it rained, [the roof] leaked. It poured inside the house. And they talked about running around and getting buckets to catch the water. They talked about rescuing the book that we\u2019re talking about \u2014 rescuing that log book from the deluge that was coming through the roof,\u201d Allen said.The last page of the journal is a watercolor painting of the island with the rickety cottage. In the margin is the handwritten note, \u201cA small green isle \u2014 it seemed \u2014 no more.\u201d One of the essays the women read aloud was \u201cWestminster Abbey,\u201d a somber reflection by Washington Irving on the fleeting of time.\u201cAnd one of them made mention of memories, and things we leave behind for people to find out something about ourselves. And I just thought, those women quoted from or read that particular passage. Did they ever dream that their journal was going to be looked at over 100 years later?\u201d Allen said.Irving wrote: Time is ever silently turning over his pages; we are too much engrossed by the story of the present, to think of the characters and anecdotes that gave interest to the past; and each age is a volume thrown aside to be speedily forgotten.But this leather-bound volume will not be forgotten. These modern-day sleuths have joined hands with the Friends of the Boston Harbor Islands to publish the journal in June. In addition to the original entries from 1891, their book will chronicle the detective work that led to the discovery of the travelers\u2019 identities, with proceeds going to the nonprofit. With the printing, it will preserve this snapshot of Boston Harbor\u2019s history, and preserve the women themselves \u2014 under their own names.",

      "body": "Boston Police Commissioner Michael Cox expressed support Tuesday for removing arbitration as an option for fired officers to regain employment. Cox, who officially assumed leadership of the department in August, said the police department should also improve the quality of its internal investigations and its disciplinary history records.\u201cI think if we fire somebody, they should stay fired,\u201d said Cox while marking his inaugural appearance on Boston Public Radio. \u201cThat being said, I think we also need to own the fact that we need to do better investigations to make sure that they stay fired \u2014 to make sure that we\u2019re contacting the people appropriately, make sure we\u2019re documenting things along the way, so it makes it a whole lot harder for an arbitrator to rule against us.\u201dCox echoed a sentiment held by his boss, Mayor Michelle Wu, who campaigned on a pledge to achieve certain reforms through a renegotiated contract agreement with the city\u2019s police force. The Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Association, the city\u2019s largest police union that represents rank and file officers, attempted to halt negotiations late last year after the organization sought intervention from the Joint Labor Management Committee, the states\u2019 collective bargaining oversight and dispute resolution agency. The Wu administration asserts the collective bargaining process is ongoing. Wu has said publicly that establishing parameters for dismissals that cannot be appealed is a red line for her administration in the talks.Cox said in his view, arbitration awards have \"far been too generous\" to police unions in representation about fired individuals coming back on.\u201cEither an officer belongs on the job, or they don\u2019t \u2014 and our job is to make sure that we investigate and do all we can to separate the ones that don't belong here,\u201d he added.Mayor Michelle Wu announced Cox as her selection last July after the force had only interim leadership for more than a year.The commissioner took the helm of a department sieged by multiple scandals involving past and pending investigations, among them: the conviction of a former police union head for child abuse allegations corroborated while he was an officer decades before; the sudden dismissal of a former commissioner over decades old domestic abuse allegations; and the alleged participation of at least one officer in the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol attack. That investigation, which has now dragged on for nearly two years, will \u201csoon\u201d end, Cox said, parroting an assertion from Wu last month. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on something pending beforehand so we can have a reason for someone to arbitrate against us,\u201d he said to laughter.Cox also expressed support for police officers being stationed in public schools, arguing that the exposure could counter stereotypes and fear.\u201cWhen my kids were little and they were afraid of the dark, I didn't say, \u2018Never walk into the dark again.\u2019 I tried to help them through it \u2026 and let them know, you turn a light on and see it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of here. There's nothing to be afraid of about policing,\u201d Cox said. \u201cPolicing being done now is better than it's ever been done in the history of policing. But the reality is the narrative that's out there is almost the opposite because of social media and things of that nature. When you have to scan the entire United States to find one example here or one example there, that is not a systemic problem.\u201d",

      "body": "Sixty years ago, the Supreme Court recognized that criminal defendants have a right to counsel at trial, which means that if they're too poor to pay for an attorney, the government will assign one. Nowadays, defendants have a right not only to a lawyer, but to an effective lawyer. But judges have struggled with how to draw the line between effective and ineffective, and this has huge implications: If a judge finds that defense counsel is ineffective, it can lead to a new trial. GBH legal analyst and Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed joined Morning Edition co-host Jeremy Siegel to talk about a case that could change how that's done in Massachusetts. This transcript has been lightly edited. Jeremy Siegel: This is something that I think a lot of people know a little bit about, and not that many people know a lot about. I might be dating myself a little bit here, but I did not even know that the right to counsel came just 60 years ago. It's something I'm familiar with because of TV shows where police tell you 'you have the right to remain silent' and that you have the right to an attorney. But it's definitely less-known that you have a right to an effective attorney. You don't hear police officers in TV shows saying that to people when they're arrested. How exactly does this work? Daniel Medwed: As you mentioned at the top, a series of Supreme Court cases have carved out a federal constitutional right to an effective attorney at the pretrial and trial stages of your case, which means that if you can prove that your lawyer was ineffective, you can get a new trial. The problem is the Supreme Court has created a very, very high bar for proving that your lawyer was ineffective. The test comes from a rather well-known 1984 case called Strickland v. Washington, which set up a two-part standard. First, as a defendant who lost a trial, you have to prove on appeal that your trial lawyer was defective, was deficient: they failed to investigate the case, they didn't put on an alibi witness, they didn't cross-examine their opponents, things like that. And then second, you have to show that the deficiency somehow contributed to the bad verdict, to the conviction. In other words, it's not enough to show that your lawyer messed up. You have to show that that error was somehow outcome-determinative. Siegel: I think for people trying to make sense of this, in a way, it makes sense that you want to make it a thorough process to prove that someone's ineffective, because you don't want people abusing it and appealing every case on this. But the second part of that kind of stuck out to me: That you don't just have to prove that your lawyer is ineffective, but you essentially have to prove that their horrible work as your attorney is what led to conviction at trial. Medwed: Exactly. It's a little bit like the no harm, no foul concept in sports. You actually have to show that there was an impact on the ultimate decision because of the error. And this can lead to some absurd outcomes. I saw one study that found that 97% of the time when a defendant raises one of these ineffectiveness issues on appeal, they lose. And cases where lawyers were drunk or under the influence of drugs have been upheld, or at least not considered ineffective performance of counsel. One despicable case from Texas, I think, is really illustrative: A man is charged with murder and he's facing the death penalty. He's too poor to pay for a lawyer, so he's assigned one by the court. That lawyer falls asleep intermittently throughout the trial. The defendant goes to the judge to alert the judge about this, and here's the judge's response: the Constitution says you're entitled to an attorney. It says nothing about that attorney being awake. Siegel: That's just shocking to hear that. Daniel, tell us about the situation here in Massachusetts. Do we have to follow the Supreme Court case law or could we, say, provide more protection to criminal defendants in these situations? Medwed: Well, here in Massachusetts, we could create a more robust ineffectiveness doctrine than the Supreme Court demands. And here's why: it's often said that the federal Constitution is a floor. States can't provide fewer rights, less protection, than the Supreme Court and the federal Constitution require. But there's no ceiling. We can always provide more. So that's one reason among many why we still have a robust right for people to terminate pregnancies if they so choose, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has eviscerated the federal constitutional right to choice in the Dobbs case from last year. So we could create a more robust right if we wanted. Siegel: I mentioned earlier that there is a case pending in Massachusetts that could affect how these types of ineffective lawyering claims end up being treated. What exactly is at stake here? Medwed: So tomorrow, the SJC is going to hear oral arguments in a case involving a defendant named Nyasani Watt. The facts are pretty procedurally complicated, but here's the main gist: Watt was charged with first degree murder for participating in the shooting death of a young man in Dorchester back in 2011. Watt was only 17 at the time. The case went to trial a few years later, he was convicted, sentenced to life behind bars, and then he lost his appeal. Fast-forward another few years: He accumulated some evidence that his lawyer had fallen asleep off and on at trial. And he even got affidavits from a bunch of courtroom observers, folks who were in the courtroom at the time of the trial, including several prosecutors, to verify that the lawyer fell asleep. So Watt assembled all this information and filed a post-appeal motion with the original trial judge. But the trial judge said there wasn't enough information that the lawyer fell asleep at critical parts of the trial or for a substantial portion of the trial. So at least in theory, this case could provide an opportunity for the court to really evaluate whether we tolerate sleeping lawyers in criminal cases in Massachusetts. Siegel: So what do you think will end up happening here? Medwed: You know, I'm not so sure. On the one hand, there are lots of issues in this case, and it's possible the SJC will hang its hat on another issue and bypass that substantive issue altogether. For instance, there's a question about whether why Watt waited too long to file this claim, whether he should have acted earlier in the process, or whether the fact that he was really young at the time of his trial and appeal should excuse that failure to raise it before. On the other hand, if the court is inclined to take another look at the substantive doctrine here, it could provide a chance to create greater protections for criminal defendants in Massachusetts than the federal Constitution demands.",

      "body": "Two months after she took office, Gov. Maura Healey is now backed up by a full cabinet \u2014 at least as it's currently envisioned.Capping off the slate she\u2019s been gradually building since December, Healey\u2019s final two picks \u2013 former state Rep. Jon Santiago as veterans\u2019 services secretary and former Boston Medical Center CEO Kate Walsh as health and human services secretary \u2013 were sworn in March 1. Joined by family members in Healey's office, they took ceremonial oaths again last Friday before sitting down for their first full Cabinet meeting. Gesturing at the members of veterans services organizations who packed the room, Walsh said it was \"an honor to be sworn in with this crowd \u2013 and thanks, Jon, for bringing a crowd.\"The crowd will soon grow bigger. Healey's cabinet is already larger than the one her predecessor, former Gov. Charlie Baker, left office with \u2013 and more diverse, with six women and four people of color. She's looking to add one more member, and filed legislation last week that would officially add a secretary of housing and livable communities. Of Healey's current cabinet, most are Beacon Hill veterans, including several who already proved themselves as trusted deputies working under Healey in the attorney general\u2019s office. Three served in the administration of the state\u2019s last Democrat governor, Deval Patrick, two worked under former Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, and one joins Healey\u2019s team from the Biden Administration. Suffolk University political science professor Rachael Cobb said Healey's assembled a \"competent group of people,\" with deep and broad knowledge in their fields, from an education secretary with a classroom background to a finance secretary versed in the intracacies of higher education funding \u2013 a theme of the first budget he helped build. \"If we want competence in governance, and we in a democracy elected the executive to implement things, they are people in charge of that policy implementation,\" Cobb said.The 11 cabinet secretaries are the Healey administration\u2019s top officials, overseeing everything from the state\u2019s Medicaid program to its schools, highways, parks, prisons and cybersecurity systems. Despite years of experience in their fields and in government, many are relatively unknown to the public. Here\u2019s a look at who will have Healey\u2019s ear on some of the most pressing issues facing the state. Administration and Finance Secretary Matt Gorzkowicz: Healey\u2019s budget chief was her first appointment, and his initial task was crafting her $55.5 billion spending plan. Gorzkowicz joined the administration from the UMass president\u2019s office, where he spent more than a decade as associate vice president of administration and finance. The Winthrop resident has had a long, behind-the-scenes career in state government, with time at the state Senate, Department of Mental Health and School Building Authority. The Executive Office of Administration and Finance is familiar territory for him, too \u2013 he served as assistant secretary for budget and later as undersecretary under Gov. Patrick. Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler: Tutwiler has seen firsthand what state education policy looks like in the field \u2013 he\u2019s worked in the Boston, Westford, Wayland and Lynn school systems, as a history teacher, principal and superintendent. As Lynn's superintendent, he testified last year before the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education about the challenges districts faced as they emerged from the COVID-19 remote learning era. He also helped establish Lynn\u2019s early college program, which is relevant now because Healey wants to expand early college offerings. Before joining the Healey administration, Tutwiler was senior program officer for education at the Barr Foundation, an organization that Healey worked with on various initiatives as attorney general. Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper: Tepper is continuing as Healey's top advisor on energy and the environment, coming from her previous role as chief of the energy and environment bureau in the AG's office. Before that, she worked as general counsel for the state Department of Public Utilities, an agency that's now under her purview, and director of the Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board. Tepper, too, has drawn from the AG's office as she staffs up, recently announcing Elizabeth Mahony, a former assistant attorney general, as the new Department of Energy Resources commissioner. Climate Chief Melissa Hoffer: On Healey\u2019s second day as governor, she signed an executive order creating the cabinet post of climate chief, a national first. Hoffer's job is to advise Healey and lead development and implementation of climate policy across agencies. Again, Healey\u2019s used to hearing from her: Hoffer was chief of the AG\u2019s energy and environment bureau before Tepper, and led Healey\u2019s high-profile climate change litigation against ExxonMobil. Hoffer left the AG\u2019s office to work in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as an appointee of President Joe Biden, and she\u2019s also worked for the Conservation Law Foundation, active advocates on Beacon Hill. Public Safety and Security Secretary Terrence Reidy: The sole holdover from Gov. Charlie Baker\u2019s cabinet, Reidy has been the state\u2019s top public safety official since July 2021. He, too, has previous Healey ties \u2013 he was an assistant attorney general and chief of her enterprise, major and cyber crimes division. Reidy and Healey also teamed up last July to issue guidance clarifying the state\u2019s gun licensing laws in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a New York law around licenses to carry firearms in public. Earlier in his career, he was an assistant district attorney in Suffolk and Worcester counties. Economic Development Secretary Yvonne Hao: Without prior public-sector experience, Hao is a bit of an outlier among the secretaries. But she brings to the role more than 25 years of executive business experience, and what Healey described as \"a proven record of growing businesses and turning ideas into results.\" The first woman and first person of color to lead the state's chief economic development agency, Hao has links to the eastern and western parts of the state, with homes in Cambridge and Williamstown. She cofounded Boston investment firm Cove Hill Partners, and her resume also includes prominent positions at venture capital firm Pillar Ventures, online pharmacy PillPack, and Bain Capital.Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Lauren Jones: This is a homecoming for Jones, formerly communications director for the labor secretariat. Jones held that post during the Patrick administration, when she was also a top aide to Lt. Gov. Tim Murray. After the State House, Jones joined Walsh\u2019s team in Boston City Hall and went on to work for the Massachusetts Business Roundtable. She served on a legislative commission last session that found the state must transform its education and worker training programs \"to ensure workers are connected to the jobs of the future\" \u2013 and make sure people have the childcare, transportation and housing they need to participate in the workforce. Transportation Secretary Gina Fiandaca: Fiandaca, now in charge of the MBTA, the Registry of Motor Vehicles, and state roads, long had a front-row seat the to the challenges of getting around the state\u2019s capital city, leading Boston\u2019s parking office and later, under former Mayor Walsh, its full transportation department. She\u2019s returning to Massachusetts after a stint as assistant city manager in Austin, Texas, overseeing infrastructure and mobility departments. When she took on that role, she told the Austin American-Statesman that her toughest day on the job in the past was Boston\u2019s winter of 2015, when historic snowfalls walloped the city\u2019s transportation system. Technology Services and Security Secretary Jason Snyder: Snyder joined Healey's team after almost a decade at Harvard University, where he was most recently chief technology officer. He fills a Cabinet post Gov. Baker created in 2017 to elevate IT and cybersecurity services, and is returning to state government to do so \u2014 Snyder was the state's chief technology officer during Gov. Patrick's two terms. He's also worked in the private sector, for the IT service provider CSC Consulting Group.Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh: While Walsh hasn\u2019t worked for the state before, she\u2019s been an active presence on Beacon Hill for years, testifying on health matters and serving on commissions addressing digital health care, wage equity and more. Walsh and Healey have worked together before on gun safety. The longtime hospital executive is respected in her field \u2013 Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association President Steve Walsh (who is not related to Secretary Walsh) described her as \"a tireless community advocate, a health equity champion, and a consensus-builder for a complex sector entering a transformational time in care delivery.\u201d Reproductive health advocates also cheered her appointment.Veterans Services Secretary Jon Santiago: Santiago will be the first veterans secretary to report directly to the governor, the result of a reform law passed after the deadly COVID-19 outbreak at the Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home. Having simultaneously served as a state representative from the South End, an ER doctor at Boston Medical Center (where he worked with Secretary Walsh) and a major in the U.S. Army Reserve, he brings a unique set of experiences to the job. He ran for Boston mayor in 2021, touting his crisis-leadership skills. One of the bills Santiago filed this session would increase tax exemption thresholds for veterans, an idea he could continue to advocate for from within the administration. GBH News is teaming up with New England Public Media in Western, MA and CAI on the Cape, coast and islands, to take a closer look at Governor Healey's political agenda.

      "body": "Last year after a neo-Nazi group displayed a banner at the St. Patrick's Day Parade that read \"Keep Boston Irish\" local leaders pledged to prevent a repeat of the incident, which received international coverage. Over the past weekend, U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, state Sen. Nick Collins, Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, state Rep. David Biele and at-large City Councilor Michael Flaherty signed a joint letter to MBTA police Chief Kenneth Green requesting that MBTA officials take steps to keep right wing extremists away from this year\u2019s parade, which takes place on Sunday, March 19.Lynch said these extremist groups, that include NSC-131 or Nationalist Social Club, carried out violence and intimidation aboard subway and commuter trains heading into South Boston around the time of the 2022 parade. \u201cThey were damaging MTA property, commuter rail property, and there were confrontations in transit,\" Lynch told GBH News. \"And if we had had early intervention, I think we might have stopped some of these groups from actually getting to the parade.\u201dOn social media, some expressed concerns about violating the first amendment rights of right wing protesters. Collins, who represents South Boston, said those fears are misplaced. \u201cFolks are concerned about the curtailing of free speech and the First Amendment. We're not talking about that,\" Collins said. \"They defaced public property, and that's against the law. So we're sending the message out that if you break the law, you'll be held accountable.\u201dThis year\u2019s parade is predicted to bring up to a million people into South Boston, a neighborhood of about 35,000 people.\u201cSo most people coming in that day are visitors, celebrating our roots, our heritage, our multicultural communities,\u201d said Collins. \u201cWhat we're trying to ensure is that happens from beginning to end. And for most people that starts with a ride on the T.\u201dOn a Telegram channel last year, right-wing extremists referenced the 1970s racial violence against school integration to support their belief that they had local support. South Boston, or Southie as it is known locally, at the time was a mainly white Irish American neighborhood, and was a hotbed of opposition to school busing.Lynch said that was a long time ago, and since then South Boston has become a majority-minority population. And in a pointed message to NSC-131, Patriot Front and other extremists, Lynch offered a reminder of a time \u201cwhen the Ku Klux Klan came to South Boston and they were ridden out on a rail. They wrongfully assumed that that there's fertile ground here for that hate.\u201dLocal antifascist filmmakers Lauren Pespisa and Rod Webber are skeptical of the political response to the threat posed by hate groups, describing it as \u201crhetorical.\u201d Pespisa and Webber last March saw a social media post live-tweeting the presence of NSC-131 at the parade. They said they jumped into a car and made their way to South Boston where they confronted members of the group with a sign and chants, and accused the Boston police of \u201cstanding by doing nothing.\u201dPespisa told GBH News she would advise parade goers to physically protest: \u201cIf you see something, do something,\u201d to demonstrate that Nazism will not be accepted in \u201cany community.\u201d Collins said he doesn\u2019t disagree, but says whatever action is taken should be in coordination with law enforcement.\u201cWhen you see these messages [hate banners and stickers] are being put up on public property or assets, you know, they have to come down right away,\" Collins said. \"If you see this happening ... notify the transit police, if it's on the train system or if it's inside the city of Boston.\u201dLynch said the leaders have asked the MBTA to put on extra staff the weekend of March 19 and \u201cto be more keenly aware of the possibility of some of these hate groups trying to capitalize on a family parade environment to showcase their hate and intolerance.\u201d T superintendent Richard Sullivan said in a written statement the Transit Police will have an enhanced security plan for the parade. Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins also has also issued a reminder to residents who suspect white supremacist activity that they can report it by calling 1-83-END-H8-NOW (1-833-634-8669).Officials including Rollins, Mayor Michelle Wu, and Attorney General Andrea Campbell will meet with police and the FBI a few days before the parade to discuss safety and crowd control.

      "body": "For more than two hundred years, March 5 has been known as the anniversary of the Boston Massacre in the City of Boston. But on Sunday, the city marked the day as Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day in honor of the man who is historically regarded as the first person killed by British shots on March 5, 1770. It\u2019s a move that comes as the city aims to grapple with its own past and give a better picture of who Attucks was. At an event on Thursday announcing the official commemoration, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu remarked that the narratives of the day often portrayed Attucks as white, erasing his mixed African and Native American heritage. \u201cErasing the fact that a formerly enslaved man faced down British muskets for our nation\u2019s freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd erasing the historical fact that it was the courage of a person of color that stoked the flames of this revolution.\u201dWu said that the acknowledgement of March 5 as Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day is in the spirit of the city\u2019s new reparations task force, saying that that work must begin with a \u201crecognition of the full truth of our history, the kind of truth on which meaningful healing and repair can finally be built.\u201dThe move was applauded by Haroon Rashid with the Friends of Crispus Attucks Association, who said at Thursday\u2019s event that many historians have recognized Attucks\u2019 contributions. \u201cHowever, in the 21st century, few political leaders have publicly stated the importance of knowing that a man of African and American Indigenous descent became popularly known as the first to defy and the first to die for American independence,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd his name was Crispus Attucks.\u201dOn Sunday, at the Old State House, one program focused on the impact of the many forms of political violence from the state. Nathaniel Sheidley, president and CEO of Revolutionary Spaces, said that while they didn\u2019t know that Crispus Attucks Commemoration Day would coincide with that programming when they were planning it, they have been trying to center Attucks in their telling of the Boston Massacre for a while now. He said that the commemoration is important not just for Attucks\u2019 legacy, but for Boston. \u201cI think that one of the challenges that we face as a city is to tell the story of our city\u2019s role in the nation\u2019s founding in a way that allows all of our residents to see themselves reflected in that story and to feel a sense of pride in it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Attucks is a really critical figure. He reminds us that Boston has always been a diverse place. And that people at all levels of our society have been contributors to our journey together across 250 years.\u201dSheidley also pointed out that while the city is officially recognizing a day to honor Attucks, the idea of a Crispus Attucks Day goes back all the way to the 1850s, when Black abolitionists chose to the use the anniversary of the Boston Massacre to make a statement about slavery. In the 20th century, the Boston Equal Rights League used the day to talk about the contributions of Black Bostonians and Americans. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s important that we recognize that this moment of inflection, kind of official blessing of the idea of Crispus Attucks Day, is thanks to many who have been advocating for this for a long time,\u201d he said. One of the speakers at the Old State House on Sunday was Charlot Lucien, founder of the Haitian Artists Assembly of Massachusetts. He said that there are a couple of reasons why recognizing Attucks is important. First, he said there is the imperative to acknowledge the contributions of Black people to the American Revolution. \u201cSo, had we erased Crispus Attucks in such a way that his name wasn\u2019t known, his face wasn\u2019t known, it would have been a missed opportunity for history and for the U.S. to embrace the richness of what happened in the U.S.,\u201d he said. He also tied the violence inflicted upon Attucks to violence that has historically been inflicted upon Black people across the world.\u201cAnd we need to relate a massacre in Boston to massacres that took place in other places and countries and states where Boston residents migrated from,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, this interconnectedness that can be promoted through this should not be underestimated. It has value for Boston, it has value for Boston communities and for any other state or country that at some point relates to Boston through either migration, immigration or through history.\u201d",

      "body": "While many schools in Boston like to tout their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, an LGBTQIA+ student task force at Boston University took a closer look at their own university's efforts. They were shocked by what they found. Out of 46 peer schools, including Harvard, MIT, Boston College, Tufts and Northeastern, BU ranked last in LGBTQ+ support communities and academic resources. To address this, the task force recommended the creation of a new student resource center \u2014 and BU did just that. Christa Rose, BU student and co-founder of the task force, joined All Things Considered host Arun Rath to discuss the student-led effort to make Boston University more inclusive. This transcript has been lightly edited.Arun Rath: So I understand the task force came together in the spring of last year, but take us back a little bit further and tell us more about what prompted the creation of the task force. I laid out those numbers at the beginning, but give us a sense of what that meant.Christa Rose: As you mentioned, our task force formed last spring in response to the lack of institutional inquiry into the experiences, concerns and needs of LGBTQIA+ students. So in 2018, BU actually charged an LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff, and they were explicitly told not to look at the experiences and needs of students. That task force led to the creation of the LGBTQIA+ Center for Faculty and Staff. While a parallel task force was rumored to be created around the same time, four years went by, and none ever was. So using the 2018 final report of the LGBTQIA+ task force for faculty and staff as a model, we decided to form our own task force by students, for students. Unlike the 2018 task force, ours was not officially charged by the university. In terms of timeline, from February to October of 2022, we launched an inquiry into the climate for LGBTQIA+ BU students and then compiled their findings and 16 recommendations to improve the climate into a 126-page report that was delivered to the president and provost in November of 2022. Rath: In putting together that substantial report, how did you deploy to find this out? What were the research methods that you used to make sure you were hearing from everyone on campus?Rose: We knew that the issues that LGBTQ+ students were facing were really multifaceted, so we wanted to make sure that we took a multifaceted approach to collect data on the climate. We really wanted to use a research-driven academic approach to advocacy, given that BU is a research-driven academic institution. We felt that they would be very responsive to that, and they would like to see the data. That approach included a climate survey for LGBTQ+ students. We also had an additional survey for these students to share their satisfaction \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 with the availability and accessibility of all-gender bathrooms on campus. We also held interviews with the LGBTQ+ center directors of peer and peer-plus institutions, including Tufts, Northeastern, Harvard, MIT and UMass Amherst. We conducted dozens of interviews with BU stakeholders who were either LGBTQ+ themselves or in a student support role \u2014 whether they were in health services or orientation, or the Center for Career Development \u2014 just to try to get a sense of what efforts were already in place to support LGBTQ+ students. Lastly, we had two comparative landscape analyses. One looked at criteria related to institutional LGBTQ+ support, and then another looked specifically at the academic side of things, looking at women's gender and sexuality studies programs and departments across the peer and peer-plus institutions. Rath: Tell us about the findings of the report and how that informed the kind of services you thought the centers should provide.Rose: Our findings show that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students do not believe that BU's administrators provide a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ students and that, on average, LGBTQ+ BU students are dissatisfied with the level of LGBTQ+ resources currently available at BU. And even further, 38% of students do not know of any LGBTQ+ BU resources available to them. Overall, our findings really show that the youth climate has taken a toll on LGBTQ+ students' mental and physical health, social life and academic performance. Our report makes several recommendations for what we hope the center would provide with those findings in mind. Some of those recommendations include assistance connecting students to culturally competent support resources, guidance and financial assistance with student-led advocacy and other initiatives, an emergency fund, mentorship opportunities, educational workshops and a physical space for students to hang out and study with their LGBTQIA+ peers. We really hope that, in addition to community building and having this physical space for community, policy advocacy and structural change are an integral part of the center's duties and would also emphasize throughout the report the necessity of an intersectional center that prioritizes the inclusivity and safety of our BIPOC [Black, Indigenous and people of color], trans and gender-nonconforming students. Rath: Building on that, the report addresses two main themes: improving visibility, communication and community, as well as making sure the overall student experience is more equitable and inclusive. What kind of changes would need to take place?Rose: In addition to this center, there really needs to be a university-wide climate shift. There need to be efforts across the entire university that are addressing the concerns and really aligning themselves with inclusive practices to better support LGBTQ+ students. We see the center as a critical first step in giving LGBTQ+ students the institutional support and visibility they deserve. But it really needs to be an effort that takes place across the university, split up based on department centers or offices. We really wanted to tailor our feedback to ensure that these specific centers and offices and departments knew exactly what they need to do to support LGBTQ+ students so that there was never a question of, \"OK, I see what some of the issues are, but what can we do?\" Rath: What kind of reception have you had so far from the administration and the faculty? Rose: In November of 2022, we met with the president, provost and interim dean of students. We were really nervous going into that meeting and unsure what to expect because up until then, we had historically been met with a lot of resistance, especially from the dean of students' office, regarding our advocacy efforts and bringing concerns that LGBTQ+ students have and offering recommendations on how to address those. So going into this meeting, we really prepared for all kinds of scenarios, but we were actually super pleasantly surprised by how receptive and action-oriented they were from the start. President [Robert A.] Brown was basically like, \"OK, we're going to create a center. This is a no-brainer for us. Where do you want it to be?\"There was a moment of just stunned silence from our task force because that was the question, maybe one of the very few questions that we were not anticipating for them to ask. We were, as I mentioned earlier, anticipating some resistance to our recommendations. But that's really not what we were met with at all, which was really, really surprising and great.",

      "body": "State health officials are warning residents against consuming native fish caught at 13 state parks because of elevated levels of PFAS in the water.The Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued new health advisories this week after recent testing found wild fish in those parks contained higher than recommended levels of a group of synthetic chemicals known as PFAS. The fish tested contained varying levels of PFAS, so the advisories range from eating no native fish from some bodies of water to no more than two meals a week of native fish from others. PFAS, an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of synthetic chemicals manufactured and used in consumer products and industries worldwide. Exposure to certain PFAS have been linked to changes in liver and kidney function, changes in thyroid hormone and cholesterol levels, and immune system effects. Some studies also suggest an increased risk of developing cancer following long-term exposure to elevated levels of some PFAS.Marc Nascarella, the director of the environmental toxicology program at the Department of Public Health, said other state and federal agencies have PFAS testing programs, but his department's testing prioritized areas that are popular for fishing and swimming. None of the bodies of water tested were deemed unsafe for swimming.\"We actually sampled 146 individual fish at each water body,\" Nascarella explained. \"And we sampled it the way you would eat your dinner, not the whole fish, but the fillet.\"Click here to see all freshwater fish advisories, including those for mercury and other hazards.Ashland Reservoir in Ashland: Limit all fish to one meal per month.Chicopee Reservoir in Chicopee: Do not eat any fish.Dennison Lake in Winchendon: Limit all fish to two meals per month.Dunn Pond in Gardner: Limit all fish to one meal per month.Fearing Pond in Plymouth: Limit all fish to two meals per week.Houghtons Pond in Milton: Limit all fish to one meal per week.Lake Cochituate in Natick: Do not eat any American eel, and limit other species to one meal per month.Lake Quinsigamond in Worcester: Limit all fish to one meal per two-month period.Pearce Lake in Saugus: Limit all fish to two meals per week.Pequot Pond in Westfield: Limit all fish to one meal per two-month period.Walden Pond in Concord: Limit all fish to two meals per month.Wallum Lake in Douglas: Limit all fish to two meals per month.Watsons Pond in Taunton: Limit all fish to one meal per week.While the advisories apply to all native game fish, they do not apply to stocked trout, which are raised in one of five fish hatcheries and then released into roughly 500 bodies of water across the state. The Department of Public Health said stocked trout are not likely to spend enough time in a lake or pond to become contaminated.Todd Richards, assistant director of fisheries at Mass Wildlife, said the state encourages people to fish and currently has about 200,000 licensed anglers. But he noted that while trout from the state's long-running stocking program may be safe, PFAS levels in wild fish aren't likely to go down anytime soon.\"The key to restoring these water bodies is pollution prevention and stopping the source,\" he explained. \"We do know that once PFAS stop accumulating in the waters, over time those water bodies can be restored. It's taken decades for a lot of these water bodies to return to levels where fish are safe to eat because of mercury.\" Deirdre Cummings, legislative director at MASSPIRG, said she's not surprised PFAS levels in wild fish exceed recommended levels in Massachusetts waters. She applauds the Department of Public Health for testing for the chemicals, calling it a step in the right direction. \"This is an urgent problem,\" she said, \"and unless we can turn off the tap and stop these chemicals getting into our environment, this problem will get worse and escalate over time.\" Cummings says MASSPIRG supports a bill that was recently filed by state Sen. Julian Cyr and state Rep. Kate Hogan, which calls for banning the use of PFAS statewide by 2030.",

      "body": "The Boston City Council Wednesday approved proposals to implement rent control and restructure the city\u2019s planning and development agency, advancing two major pieces of Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s legislative agenda forward to state lawmakers.Both measures passed 11-2, with Councilors Frank Baker and Erin Murphy voting against them. In a rare, post-vote media appearance, Wu said the council \"delivered a strong message\" with the rent control approval.\"The city of Boston needs the tools to address our housing crisis,\" Wu said. \"We hear from residents across every single neighborhood just how dire it is and we see families who are getting pushed out of the communities that they grew up in and helped to build. This is affecting everything from how our businesses and economy can recover to our school enrollment and the stability of every part of our neighborhoods.\"The topic of rent control was controversial even before the city began discussing Wu\u2019s proposal in earnest. The mayor is seeking to usurp a 1990s statewide ban on the policy and restore a local form of rent control in Boston. Even though a recent poll suggests the policy is popular among likely voters statewide, the Massachusetts Legislature has shown little appetite for taking up the issue. \"The goal, as always, is to be in a conversation with our city government, with our residents, with our state government,\" Wu said when asked about the measure's likelihood of success on Beacon Hill. \"We all represent the same constituents, we all hear from the same families who are struggling to hang on in the city. ... I think we all share an urgency in knowing that this can't stand for Boston.\"Wu has largely been alone as a city executive championing the issue. Mayors from several of Massachusetts' largest cities, including Cambridge, Fall River and Lynn, have indicated they have no plans to pursue their own rent control proposals. So far, only the city of Somerville, which previously had a rent control policy, has begun exploring a local option.Somerville City Council President Ben Ewen-Campen said the city's proposal is in its early stages, but they hope to present a finalized version for approval on Beacon Hill this fall. He noted that Somerville has previously sought \u2014 and failed \u2014 to bring back rent control. But he is more hopeful this time around.\"I think we're at a really important point where we have a governor who has indicated that she is supportive of municipalities taking this step,\" Ewen-Campen said.He said he considers rent control a reasonable approach to help working class people live in the city.\"The extreme position is what we have now,\" he explained, \"where some real estate investor or some LLC can buy up an apartment building and jack up the rent 30%, 40%, 100% and just evict people who have been in Somerville for years and have kids in the schools.\"In Boston, Wu\u2019s rent control proposal has upset both those with interests in the real estate sector and progressive housing advocates. The MassLandlords trade group and the Greater Boston Real Estate Board have publicly lobbied against Wu\u2019s proposal, arguing that it would stifle housing production and worsen the city\u2019s housing crisis. MassLandlords also argued Wu\u2019s proposal, which exempts owners who live with their tenants and own six units or less, leaves out landlords who don\u2019t live with their tenants, but still reside within the city of Boston. Councilor Michael Flaherty proposed an ultimately unsuccessful amendment to address that concern. Multiple councilors spoke against it, arguing that there\u2019s a distinction between landlords who live with their renters and those who own investment properties.Meanwhile, housing advocates wanted to tighten portions of Wu\u2019s plan by lowering the annual increase beyond 10% in high inflation years, or the rate of inflation plus 6% in most other years.Wu\u2019s proposal exempts college-operated dormitories and residential buildings for 15 years beginning from the date of their certificate of occupancy. It would also establish eviction protections and bar a landlord from recovering possession of a unit unless a housing court approves. Wu\u2019s agency restructure plan would, if approved by the Legislature and Gov. Maura Healey, formally dissolve the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the official entity created in 1957 to oversee the city\u2019s development activities in the era of urban renewal. The measure would codify a focus on three key planning principles \u2014 resilience, affordability and equity \u2014 and would also dissolve the partner Economic Development Industrial Corporation, established in 1971 to lead local economic development activities.Wu said Wednesday she expects \"strong\" support for the measure at the State House.The BRA began doing business as the Boston Planning and Development Agency in 2016 when then-Mayor Marty Walsh made a $600,000 bid to rebrand the agency to shed its reputation as inefficient and overly responsive to the desires of developers. Wu\u2019s proposal would maintain the rebranded name.Councilors approved one amendment to Wu\u2019s plan that maintains urban renewal land disposition agreements, area-specific restrictions that spell out what can and cannot be built in a given place.

      "body": "Members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus have thrown their support behind a state audit of the Massachusetts Convention Center Authority in response to allegations of racism and discrimination at the independent state authority. \u201cThe complaints filed by Black employees alleging discrimination in hiring, promotion, and working conditions, as well as the lack of diversity among the authority's top employees, are troubling,\u201d Executive Director Z\u00e1von Billups wrote in a statement on behalf of the caucus. \u201cThe fact that there is no diversity officer charged with creating opportunities for people of color is also a cause for concern.\u201d Over the past month, five employees filed formal complaints with the state attorney general alleging racial bias against employees, vendors and convention guests, including heightened security at Black-sponsored events and pay inequity among employees, according to reporting from The Boston Globe.The Massachusetts Convention Center Authority is one of a few independent authorities in state government that does not have a diversity officer. A Globe review also found no Black employees among the 25 highest-paid employees at the authority, including leadership. State Auditor Diana DiZoglio has launched an audit of the authority, roughly one month after the release of a previous audit into its past performance that identified \u201cseveral deficiencies\u201d in compliance with state contract laws. \u201cThe issues raised by The Boston Globe and Andrea Estes are concerning and fall precisely within the realm of objectives I have enumerated in my social justice and equity audit plan,\u201d DiZoglio said in a statement. Multiple employees of color sent an anonymous letter to Gov. Maura Healey in January, urging her to replace MCAA Executive Director David Gibbons and the rest of his leadership team. Healey\u2019s office is conducting its own investigation into the allegations. \u201cWhat has been raised and reported on is very concerning,\u201d Healey told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe're currently reviewing all of that.\u201d The Massachusetts Convention Center Authority \u201cstrongly refutes the assertions and the motivations behind them,\u201d according to a spokesperson for the authority. \u201cWe take seriously the claim that any employee, client or guest feels discriminated against, mistreated, or undervalued.\u201d The MCCA hired law firm Prince Lobel Tye LLP and principal attorney Walter Prince to \u201creview our policies and procedures at present and in the past, including the experience of employees of color within the organization and any negative experience that an attendee of color may have had at the BCEC or Hynes.\u201d The authority received formal notice of the audit, according to the spokesperson, and will be \u201cworking diligently\u201d with DiZoglio\u2019s office. In their anonymous letter to Healey, employees expressed concern about losing their jobs as a result of speaking out individually or drawing attention to cultural issues, according to the Globe. \u201cThis underscores the need for stronger protections for whistleblowers and for employers to create a culture of accountability and transparency,\u201d Billups wrote in his statement on behalf of the Black and Latino Caucus. \u201cThe allegations of racial discrimination at the [authority] are deeply concerning, and it is critical that the authorities take swift action to investigate and address these issues.\u201d Michael Curry, the former president of the NAACP Boston Branch, says he worked with David Gibbons to bring the NAACP national convention to Boston this summer. \u201cGibbons and I got together and said, 'We need to change Boston.' We proposed to the national NAACP bringing the convention here, and the convention is coming,\u201d Curry said in an interview with GBH News. \u201cI think that's a tremendous opportunity for [Gibbons] and the rest of his team to seize on that little victory, that relatively little victory, to then start getting big victories in systemic change within the Convention Center Authority.\u201dThis evaluation of the authority is an opportunity to investigate the lack of diversity among leadership at companies across the state, Curry said. \u201cThis is not unique to the Convention Center Authority. This is rampant throughout Massachusetts and particularly in Boston,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThe reality is, too many C-suites and too many organizations are predominantly white and male. We've not yet cracked the code on how we tap into talent; women and people of color who have tremendous talent to offer these organizations. Shame on us and shame on the convention center if we don't meet the moment.\u201d",

      "body": "It had been a long 367 days since Russian forces invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. But when members of Boston's Ukrainian community and their supporters flooded Copley Square on Sunday, they signaled their resolve to see Ukraine endure as a sovereign, independent nation\u2014no matter how long it takes.Bracing a bitter cold made worse by a February breeze, demonstrators carried signs along with blue and yellow flags, now recognized around the world as a symbol of resistance and solidarity. Vsevolod Petriv, president of the Boston branch of the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America, estimated that 2,000 people attended the rally. He said that the war in Ukraine is about autocracy versus democracy. And he was happy to see the solidarity of the Ukrainian diaspora evident in that struggle. \"Ukrainians are spread throughout the world due to all the different conflicts,\" he said. \"And all of these different pockets of Ukrainians are joining hands together. And that's pretty cool.\"Among the speakers at the rally was Rep. Stephen Lynch, who compared Russian president Vladimir Putin's efforts in Ukraine to those of Adolf Hitler in World War II. \"I think it's important for all of us to remember that this is not just about Ukraine,\" Lynch said. \"Ukraine stands at the frontline of democracy in Europe.\"Although she wasn't a speaker, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu issued a statement through a spokesperson proclaiming Sunday as Boston Ukraine Day. \"On this day and in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, I commend them for their strength, courage and bravery and do urge all citizens of the City of Boston to stand together in support of the Ukrainian people in this fight for freedom,\" the statement read. Sunday's crowd was a mix of people, including many who emigrated from the Eastern European country, people with ties to it and others who were there to support Ukraine on ideological grounds. Leonid Furman, 65, lives in Stoughton and came to the United States from Russia 31 years ago. He said he sees the war as something bigger than merely a fight for one country's independence.\"In my opinion, it's not the war just against Ukraine. It's a war against the whole West,\" he said. At the rally's end, demonstrators stepped inside Trinity Church for an exhibit, refreshments and a special service for Ukraine later in the afternoon. Outside, Dariella Yasyukevych, who lives in Lynn and came to the U.S. from Ukraine 15 years ago, said that the past year has been tough, with family members still in Ukraine. \"That means a lot to every Ukrainian,\" she said. \"And we appreciate that the whole world finally knows that Ukraine is not a part of Russia. That Ukraine's been independent for 31 years and that we exist, we have our culture, we have our food, our traditions, our language.\"She's hopeful for two things going forward: that Ukraine will win and that Russia will be held accountable for its actions.",

      "body": "An inquest has begun into the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal by a Cambridge police officer last month, according to a press release from Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan on Thursday. Ryan requested the independent investigation by a judge last month, a move that family members and local officials hope will offer clarity and transparency. Faisal was a 20-year-old UMass Boston student and Cambridge resident, who appeared to be having a mental health crisis when he was killed on Jan. 4. He allegedly approached officers with a knife and was shot. Barbara Dougan, legal director of the Massachusetts chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, is representing Faisal's family and said the family welcomes the inquest. Unlike a grand jury investigation, family members \u2014 and officers involved in the shooting \u2014 can be present for the process. Judges can summon witnesses and examine relevant documents, often in coordination with the district attorney. Inquests typically take several months to conclude, after which the district attorney reviews the judge\u2019s report and decides whether to pursue charges or not. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a process that's going to play out, a long-haul process that we're going to need all the support they can get,\u201d Dougan said. \u201cI guess if there's any goal, it\u2019s not only to get justice for their son, but to prevent any other family from going through something like this.\u201dIn Massachusetts, all officer-involved shootings are investigated by county district attorneys. Ryan\u2019s office has made it a practice of requesting inquests into fatal police shootings in Middlesex County since 2018. The killing of Faisal by Cambridge police stirred a strong community response, reported protests in Bangladesh and an ongoing response from the city\u2019s government. \u201cIt\u2019s a very frustrating thing that [the inquest] is going to take a couple of months,\u201d said Cambridge City Councilor Burhan Azeem. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustrations in the community that this has happened, and the police report and other things are not yet public. ... But all of the evidence, everything that people want to see, will be public at the end of the day. And I think that what is good and bad about our legal process is that we are very, very thorough. And so it takes a long time.\u201dAlso unlike a grand jury, at the end of an inquest, a detailed report and full transcript of the proceedings are made public. \u201cAn inquest is far more independent and leads to more transparency after the fact,\u201d Dougan said. \u201cI mean, during the investigation stage of the inquest, it's all closed to the public, but after the fact a report is made public. So there's more transparency, more independence, hopefully more accountability.\u201d Azeem outlined responses the city is taking, including the recent announcement of implementing a body camera program for police and alternative responses to emergency calls that involve people in a mental health crisis. \u201cWe\u2019re also not waiting for the monthslong inquest process to conclude,\u201d Azeem said. \u201cI personally don't use the word \u2018tragic\u2019 because it makes it seem as though there's nothing you could have done. And I do think that there are things that we can do and we are doing.\u201d Cambridge police spokesperson Jeremy Warnick told GBH News that the department has conducted a number of recent trainings. One in December 2022, the month before Faisal\u2019s killing, was \u201cdesigned to provide officers with more response options to help them de-escalate incidents\u201d involving mental health crises. He highlighted that officers regularly receive training on issues such as domestic violence, elder abuse and LGBTQ cultural competency. \u201cOur officers are trained and prepared to handle the evolving demands placed on them,\u201d Warnick said in an email. \u201cThere are a number of noteworthy trainings that CPD has been at the forefront of across the region and country.\u201d Warnick said regular training programs also included emphases on veterans and PTSD, fair and impartial policing and management of aggressive behavior. Azeem added that the city is exploring more non-lethal response options for police, including Tasers, which he says are currently not used by the department. \u201cWe are also looking at it in a different aspect as well, which is: how can we use increased mental health resources?\u201d Azeem said. \u201cYou know, police perhaps should not be the first line of defense for a mental health call. And if we can prevent these calls from even happening in the first place, that would be wonderful.\u201dDougan said Faisal\u2019s family is gratified that steps are being taken to decrease the likelihood of a similar deadly outcome with Cambridge police for someone in crisis. But, she added, that\u2019s not their focus. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to step in front of those folks who've already been working on this issue for years,\u201d Dougan said, \u201c[and] the family is not paying attention to body camera policies at this point. Other people are, which is good and we\u2019re glad they are. But they\u2019re just still trying to get through each day with this gaping hole in their lives, which is the loss of their only child.\u201d",

      "body": "When the light are off but sleep remains elusive, people are often tempted to look for answers where they always do: Online, and especially on YouTube.There, they can find content creators promising them easy ways to fall asleep fast, presented in attention-grabbing ways \u2014 but often with little to no scientific backing. Those videos often include misinformation and commercial biases, said Rebecca Robbins, a sleep researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an author of a new study on sleep misinformation on YouTube. \u201cThese are videos that are developed by non-health professionals, often bloggers or maybe a health coach, but someone without specific sleep expertise,\u201d Robbins told GBH\u2019s Morning Edition co-hosts Paris Alston and Jeremy Siegel. Sometimes the information has no scientific proof, but not directly harmful: That people should open and close their eyes a certain way, blink a certain number of times or find a pressure point on their foreheads. In one video Robbins reviewed, a creator talks about a \u201cmagic sleeping button\u201d and demonstrates her technique by pressing down on a point in the center of her cat\u2019s forehead. There\u2019s no evidence that those things work, Robbins said. \u201cThat is one claim that is certainly false. We don't have any evidence of such a sleep button,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cBut some of the more concerning claims had to do with beliefs that there are ways to get close to four hours of sleep, and some of the videos claim that their hacks would help you get there. And of course, that is false.\u201dRobbins and her colleagues reviewed the most-watched YouTube videos that came up when they searched for keywords like \u201cinsomnia\u201d and \u201csleep tips.\u201d They watched videos by popular creators, with an average of 8.2 million views per video, and compared them to videos made by doctors and sleep experts, which got an average of just 300,000 views per video. The more popular videos, often produced by people who create YouTube videos and other content professionally, often had misinformation, Robbins said. About two thirds of them also promoted a product or service. \u201cSome of these bloggers, they're really talented video creators. And so they use things like clickbait and kind of racy photos in some cases, and these claims that are controversial and lacking evidence base to kind of draw attention.\u201dThere\u2019s no one easy trick to help everyone fall asleep. But there are many evidence-based things to try. First: Don\u2019t skimp on sleep, Robbins said. \u201cThe optimal health and well-being for adults comes from sleep duration in the range of seven to nine hours, and we're all in a different place along that spectrum,\u201d she said. Try to go to bed around the same time, and wake up around the same time. Falling asleep is easier on a relatively consistent schedule, she said. \u201cIn a typical seven-day week, you want to vary by no more than one hour,\u201d she said. \u201cOur ability to fall asleep and wake up is in part governed by hormones that are associated with those processes. And those can't change on a dime.\"Try to think of falling asleep as a process, not the one magical moment of drifting off. \u201cIt would be wonderful to have such a sleep switch, as the YouTuber mentioned,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cThe truth is we kind of need to look at sleep as a process and setting ourselves up for success with relaxation techniques, unplugging from screens before bedtime to help us ease into sleep.\u201dOther things to try: Exercising during the day, though not right before bed and avoiding heavy meals right before bedtime. \u201cIf you're tossing and turning, maybe practicing some gentle meditation or gentle yoga poses could be a good way also to help you kind of overcome some of those insomnia like symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cThe good news is small changes go a long way when it comes to our sleep.\u201dNone of the techniques are perfect, Robbins said. Life gets in the way, and insomnia will sometimes come despite best efforts.\u201cSleep isn't going to be perfect every night,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we seek perfection and then we get frustrated when we experience difficulties. But the truth is: sleep is fundamentally a consequence of our daily lives.\u201d",

There was the earthquake that devastated Turkey and Syria, a number of deadly shootings and the one-year anniversary of the war in Ukraine. Locally, Boston has been mourning two horrific acts of violence against Black people: the murder of 13-year-old Tyler Lawrence of Norwood in Mattapan, and the police beating death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis. Through all the tragedy within Black communities and beyond, there is resilience \u2014 resilience that comes from love. To capture that, we reached out to a few people to share their love stories.LaTrelle and Tyrone Chase met in high school, but as with many couples, they debate the details of the first encounter.\u201cIt was ninth grade, what was it, lunch?\u201d Tyrone said.\u201cYeah, you were talking about my jacket,\u201d LaTrelle said, laughing. \u201cShe had a Members Only jacket,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was not a Members Only jacket,\u201d she said.The two have been married for almost 27 years, and are still just as playful with each other today.In their time together, Latrelle and Tyrone Chase have shared joy and pain, including coming to terms with not being able to have children. LaTrelle Chase had her first miscarriage less than a year after their wedding, and her second a little over a year later. The following year, she miscarried again. \u201cMiscarriage and child loss is an extremely prevalent thing in the Black community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was extremely difficult. It was embarrassing. And it definitely tested our relationship.\u201d\u201cYou always want to hear the happy ending, and this is not necessarily a happy ending,\u201d Tyrone Chase said. \u201cBut we can live through it, and it not destroy us.\u201dIn fact, the Chases say it made their relationship stronger. It\u2019s that will to keep going that has always carried Black people through tough times, even when they shouldn\u2019t have had to.Rod Collins is the nephew of civil rights icon Malcolm X, who came to Boston as a teenager in the 1940s to live with his sister and Rod\u2019s mother, Ella Little-Collins, in what is now the Malcolm X-Ella Little-Collins house in Roxbury. His family\u2019s history led him to India in 1986. There, he met his wife, Annie, while she was working at a hotel. \u201cI [see] this stunning, beautiful young lady when I go to the counter and get my keys, and I caught her eyes \u2014 the eyes that went into your soul,\u201d Rod Collins said. \u201cHer pleasantry, her spirit, everything about her. I tried to dismiss it a little bit, but then she finally got to me.\u201d\u201cThe first questions that Rod asked me were \u2018Can I have my keys?\u2019 and \u2018Are you married?\u2019\u201d Annie Collins said. \u201cAnd I said \u2018Yes, you can have your keys, and no, I\u2019m not married.\u2019\u201dAs their relationship blossomed, Annie\u2019s family warned things would be difficult for her in the U.S.\u201cMy dad knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy,\u201d Annie Collins said. \u201cWe never traveled or anything, but my dad understood the challenges that I would have being married to a Black person in America.\u201dIndeed, long before hashtags and viral videos, the world knew Black people were treated differently here. But for more than 35 years, Annie has chosen to love Rod despite those challenges. She said they have endured instances of injustice, including violence inflicted on their children, Arjun and Dayorsha, by Boston police in the early 2000s. \u201cSupposedly, the cops said somebody called and said this tall Middle Eastern-looking girl has a gun in her bag,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so they came in and of course, and they went to Dayorsha. Arjun, of course, reacted. And this cop, he put a gun in Arjun's back. Because he was reacting to his sister being attacked. And so, you know, it's just things like that. It always reminds me of what my dad said.\u201dAnnie said they did not file a report about the incident. Rod said as some of the most loving and giving people on the Earth, Black people should be judicious about who they give their love to. It\u2019s a sentiment echoed by his uncle in this undated speech: \u201cWe are peaceful people, we are loving people,\u201d Malcolm X said. \u201cWe love everybody who loves us. But we don\u2019t love anybody who doesn\u2019t love us. We\u2019re nonviolent with people who are nonviolent with us. But we are not nonviolent with anyone who is violent with us.\u201dHistorically, Malcolm X's tactics have been juxtaposed against the righteous love and peaceful nonviolence characterized by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But taking a closer look, you can see love along the entire spectrum of the struggle, even if it has to be unearthed. And when that love doesn't come from others, it's important to find it within oneself.\"Self-love, for me, is educating myself about being Black,\" said 15-year-old Ketura Joseph, a ninth grader at Brooke Charter High School in Boston.With that education, her understanding of Black history and resilience has changed, she said.\"I always saw slavery as such a terrible thing, and I guess that changed this year for me in high school since they put more emphasis on people being brave, overcoming challenges,\" Joseph said. \"And if you really know how to love yourself, then you can really be proud to be Black.\"So here's to love and here's to Blackness, both being celebrated and persevering all month and all year long.",

      "body": "Updated at 1:24 p.m.SeparatorBoston Police Commissioner Michael Cox responded Monday night to accusations of political discrimination from a pair of recently fired officers, saying the two individuals were dismissed for different reasons after internal investigations. Two former members of the Boston Police Department, Sgt. Shana Cottone and Officer Joe Abasciano, said they were terminated from employment Monday. Both have amassed media attention from actions related to their political views over the last two years. In a statement via Boston First Responders United, the anti-vaccine mandate group for public safety employees, Cottone and Abasciano charged that their firings were \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and retaliation \u201cfor speaking out in support of personal choice and freedom of speech.\u201dCottone was one of the officers leading the charge against Mayor Michelle Wu\u2019s vaccine mandate as the city began emerging from strict quarantine measures last year. She repeatedly protested in front of the mayor\u2019s Roslindale home, which prompted the Boston City Council to scale back the lawful hours of targeted picketing.Abasciano took part in the anti-vaccine mandate protests and was also one of two officers investigated for tweets and alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in 2021. In a statement to GBH News Monday night, Cox said the firings were decided in separate cases based on their conduct.\u201cWhile in the Department\u2019s employ, Abasciano authored a series of social media posts that called into question his ability to provide police services in an unbiased and objective manner,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cAbasciano\u2019 s conduct impairs the operation of this Department and its employees by diminishing the Departments\u2019 reputation and trust within the community. Due to this Mr. Abasciano is no longer a Boston Police officer.\"The commissioner did not say which of Abasciano\u2019s specific social media posts violated the department\u2019s rules of conduct or canon of ethics, but an internal affairs document obtained by GBH News shows his confirmed Twitter account tweeting messages that could be interpreted as threatening toward then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other officials.Tweet posted at 6:44 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cMAGA Millions Patriots here in DC. Today is a day for choosing. Today there will only two parties in America. Traitors and Patriots!\u201d Tweet posted at 8:14 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cHey @senatemajldr look out your window. Millions of Patriots are on your doorstep and we are watching. It is a time for choosing. Are yiu a traitor or are you a patriot.\u201d @senatemajldr is the former Twitter handle of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Tweet posted at 12:40 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cEverything that happens going forward @ VP is now on your conscience.\u201d Tweet posted at 3:54 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cI hope you never sleep well again @VP your Treasonous Act lead to the murder of an innocent girl and the death of America. You are not a Godley man. I guess @LLinWood was right about you all along.\u201d @LLinWood was an account that previously made direct statements about plans to harm the Vice President. Abasciano claimed the tweet was not posted in reference to those threats. Tweet posted at 5:22 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021: \u201cWhat I saw in today frankly made me weep for our once-great nation. The Political Elitist Class has successfully turned Americans against each other. Patriots v Law Enforcement trying to do their jobs in a no-win position. I fear this Treasonous election has killed the republic.\u201d The investigator who examined Abasciano\u2019s case \u2014 which initially involved a charge of neglect of duty/unreasonable judgment \u2014 ultimately recommended a finding of \u201cnot sustained.\u201dReached by phone Monday, Abasciano said his termination was \u201cclearly\u201d retaliatory and punitive.\u201cIt\u2019s my First Amendment right to express my feelings and sentiments,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mayor is pushing for an overarching, anti-First Amendment policy for all city employees where they\u2019re not allowed to speak out against the City Council, [or] her [the mayor's] city policy.\u201dAbasciano added that, at one point, his case was closed, then re-opened for further investigation before he was ultimately fired. GBH News has repeatedly asked the mayor about Abasciano\u2019s case during her monthly appearances on the midday Boston Public Radio program. In her latest appearance Tuesday afternoon, Wu backed the commissioner\u2019s decision to fire Cottone and Abasciano.\u201cI support Commissioner Cox's decision to move forward with termination for these officers. Each has a separate set of actions that was detailed [and] investigated,\u201d Wu said, adding that a third officer, Michael Geary, was also recently terminated.Geary, Wu said, responded to an FBI call for help identifying Jan. 6 rioters with a message that said \u201crats get bats.\u201d\u201cPolice officers perform some of the most important work in our society,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cThey swear an oath to uphold the laws of our country, our state and our city, as well as the rules of the Boston Police Department, that is how we implement public safety is by ensuring the public trust that the laws will be upheld and that rules will be followed fairly. That means at a very baseline, our officers have to follow the rules.\u201dRegarding Cottone, Cox said she had \u201cmultiple violations\u201d of several department rules and procedures.\u201cThere were six separate internal affairs investigations,\u201d Cox said, pointing to a neglect of duty charge, a respectful treatment charge, a statement of opinions charge and a conformance to laws charge.\u201cCottone\u2019s conduct in these cases reflects a pattern and inability to adhere to the rules and procedures of this Department. These violations along with Cottone\u2019s disciplinary history render her unsuitable to continue her employment with the Boston Police Department and thus her employment has been terminated.\"Said Cottone: \u201cThe type of protest I engaged in was peaceful protest. That\u2019s the type of protest that our country was founded on. Standing outside of the mayor\u2019s house chanting 'Shame on Wu' is not really the most sensational type of protest.\u201dBoth officers have obtained attorneys and pledged to appeal their firings. This story was updated to include Mayor Michelle Wu's comments on Boston Public Radio.",

      "body": "A handful of incumbent politicians are seeking to testify in the federal court case challenging the legality of Boston\u2019s voter district maps, including U.S. Rep. Stephen Lynch, who has served in Congress since 2001.Rep. Lynch represents Massachusett\u2019s 8th District, which includes part of Boston. Court documents filed last week show Lynch as scheduled to offer in-person testimony when arguments to bar the City of Boston from enacting its redistricting maps are heard Tuesday. A second hearing date in the case is scheduled for later this month. Others intending to testify this month include Boston City Council President Ed Flynn, At-Large Councilor Michael Flaherty, State Senator Nick Collins and former City Councilor and recently retired City Clerk Maureen Feeney.The lawsuit lays bare a rift among Boston Democrats who have drifted into two camps in recent years \u2014 in one lies an increasingly progressive crop of new politicians, in the other, the centrists of the old guard.The rift, which plays out frequently among the historically diverse Boston City Council, has tended to fall along racial lines, with councilors of color typically aligning in the progressive bloc, and white councilors, particularly those with ties to the neighborhoods that represent traditional centers of white power and influence, filing into the centrist bloc.Race and power emerged as a flashpoint during the redistricting process as the council attempted to address an explosion of growth in the South Boston Seaport neighborhood and a simultaneous loss of Black residents across the city over the last decade.Between September 2021 and November 2022, councilors involved in the map-making process attempted to remedy the issues by shaving off a portion of the overgrown South Boston district and adding it to a neighboring Dorchester district, triggering a shift in the bottom portion of the latter\u2019s boundary lines.Many white politicians from those two districts resisted the shift.In one community meeting, former Clerk Feeney, who represented the Dorchester district implored council members not to shift the area\u2019s boundaries. \u201cDon\u2019t take power from one neighborhood to give it to another neighborhood,\u201d she said.In an affidavit, At-Large Councilor Erin Murphy claimed that the approved map \u201cis based on race in violation of the Voting Rights Act\u201d and was designed \u201cto diminish the voting power of white voters in City Council District 3 whose rights are sacred under the VRA and the 14th Amendment.\u201dCouncil President Flynn, who currently represents the South Boston district, also called for a halt to the map\u2019s approval a day before it was scheduled to go to the floor for a vote in November.The council map-making process ended on a sour note the following day when Dorchester Councilor Frank Baker accused his Irish-born Protestant colleague, Liz Breadon of Allston-Brighton, of deliberately attempting to disempower Irish Catholics in the city with the map.The current redistricting legal case was initially brought by a coalition of predominantly white, South Boston-based political power players, including former State Rep. and former Hingham Selectman Paul Gannon, an attorney in the now-federal legal challenge.Gannon and Robert O\u2019Shea of South Boston\u2019s Democratic Ward Committee unsuccessfully attempted to block the council from approving the map with a request for a temporary restraining order in state court. In it, they alleged council members violated open meeting law on three separate occasions by meeting with a quorum, or simple majority, of redistricting committee members without giving advance notice. According to state law, if a quorum of a public body wants to discuss public business within that body\u2019s jurisdiction, they must do so during a properly posted meeting.Superior Court Judge Anthony M. Campo denied the immediate bid to block the vote.Later, the focus of the case shifted when the South Boston coalition amended their court complaint by adding several constituents of color to their cadre and alleging violations of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 14th Amendment.Lawyers for the City of Boston eventually moved the case to federal court.Lynch was not immediately available for comment regarding his role in the lawsuit, but the congressman has previously written in opposition to the redistricting map. In a November letter to the state court judge, he claimed the new map \u201carbitrarily and recklessly\u201d divided the communities in a pair of South Boston housing projects that fall within his Congressional district.\u201cThese public housing communities are classic communities of interest in the legal sense as they predominately consist of non-English speaking, low-income families of color who are kindred in socioeconomic status, education, employment and their common identity as recently arrived immigrants,\u201d Lynch wrote. Furthermore, he argued that the new map could \u201cweaken the voting strength\u201d of these like-minded voters in Boston\u2019s future elections.Judge Patti B. Saris, a Clinton-era nominee, is now presiding over the case.A coalition of advocacy groups devoted to serving marginalized populations, including the Boston Branch of the NAACP, Massachusetts Voter Table and the Chinese Progressive Association, are planning to show up to Tuesday\u2019s hearing as a show of support for Boston\u2019s latest redrawn map. The groups filed a shared legal brief in support of the city\u2019s map. The federal case adds another layer of tension to Boston\u2019s struggle with race and voting power within the storied and changing city.",

      "body": "Standing with a crowd of around 300 people outside the Massachusetts State House, the Rev. Lydia Shiu of Reservoir Church in Cambridge evoked an enduring metaphor \u2014 that of David taking on the giant Goliath in the Bible \u2014 as she spoke of the commonwealth's housing challenges.Shiu helped lead a Greater Boston Interfaith Organization rally Thursday, where the coalition of religious groups and unions called on state leaders to make housing more affordable and accessible. She said the \u201cGBIO sling\u201d had secured past policy wins in health care and criminal justice reform. \u201cThis is not just a housing crisis. This is a human crisis,\u201d Shiu said. \u201cAnd although the housing crisis purports itself to be a complex and complicated problem \u2014 and yes, folks, it is a hairy one \u2014 but in the face of Goliath, you cannot mess with the faith and hope of David.\u201d With its members clad in blue T-shirts, playing trombones, and holding signs with slogans like \u201cPraying with Our Feet,\u201d GBIO launched a new housing justice campaign. The campaign pushes for greater state investment in public housing, zoning reforms to encourage multifamily housing in suburbs, and housing support for formerly incarcerated people. GBIO also backs legislation that would let communities impose a new fee on certain real estate transactions, with proceeds going toward affordable housing. Under the bills, filed by Cambridge Rep. Mike Connolly and Northampton Sen. Jo Comerford, cities and towns that opt in could impose a fee of between 0.5% and 2% of the purchase price on some property sales.Municipalities could choose whether the seller or buyer pays the fee, or split it between the two. The fee would kick in only above a certain price threshold: either $1 million, or above the county's median sale price for single-family homes.Communities including Boston, Somervile, Arlington and Nantucket have sought Beacon Hill's permission to establish transfer taxes in the past, but the concept has faced opposition for years from real estate industry officials, who argue the additional fee would raise costs for buyers. Phil Hillman, a strategy leader at GBIO and member of St. Paul A.M.E. Church, said the interfaith organization supports transfer tax legislation because it knows new revenue sources will be necessary before communities can create more affordable housing.\"I have seen the impact of this housing crisis on my Dorchester community. This is a type of crisis that has touched family members, friends, coworkers [and] congregations,\" he said. \"For decades, our housing production has not kept up with our job growth. This has resulted in skyrocketing rents, huge increases in housing prices. If you are low-income \u2014 lower middle income \u2014 the dream of homeownership has become a nightmare.\"After rallying outside the State House, GBIO members planned to meet with lawmakers and staff, asking them to support the bills and funding requests that make up the organization\u2019s housing justice campaign. The organization wants lawmakers to double the amount of money Gov. Maura Healey proposed for public housing in her budget proposal. Healey's budget funds the public housing authorities' account at $92 million for next year, the same amount that was in this year's budget.At Thursday's rally, Arlene Hill described what it meant for her to move into public housing after spending time at a homeless shelter.\u201cThe ability to lock that door and be in my apartment, with no one telling me I had to do this or that, saved my life,\u201d she said. GBIO said it will move forward with several action items, and that its members plan to attend committee hearings as lawmakers vet the bills on their agenda.",

      "body": "The owner of a chain of Massachusetts pizza restaurants was arrested Thursday for allegedly forcing a worker to labor long hours for little pay while being threatened with deportation and facing severe verbal and physical abuse.Stavros Papantoniadis \u2014 who owns local restaurants called Stash\u2019s Pizza in Dorchester and Roslindale \u2014 was charged later the same day with forced labor in U.S. federal court and detained pending a detention hearing scheduled for next week, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. Charging documents detail harrowing accounts of alleged abuse. One victim claims he worked for Papantoniadis for nearly 14 years, 12 hours a day, seven days a week, without ever taking a vacation. He says he was kicked, slapped, choked and assaulted so severely he had to have his teeth removed and wear dentures. He says he believed he couldn\u2019t leave because he was undocumented and worried his employer would report him to immigration authorities.U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins said in a press release that it is a federal crime to force someone to work through the use of \u201cforce, threats of force, or coercion.\u201d She urged anyone with information about abuse to reach out to her office. \u201cThe allegations in this case are horrific. Nobody has the right to violently kick, slap, punch or choke anyone, and certainly not an employer to an employee,\u2019\u2019 Rollins said. \u201cThis case illustrates the manipulative, violent and abusive tactics some employers utilize for their own greed and financial gain.\u201dThis is the first case of forced labor filed by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office since Rollins took up the job last year. Since then, she has created a human trafficking unit focusing on sex and labor violations. The problem of forced labor, often hidden in plain sight, has been the topic of an ongoing investigation by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting. GBH News reporters have spoken with restaurant and construction workers and domestic cleaners, among others, who have detailed working long hours for little or no pay, fearful of deportation, abuse and even homelessness. \u201cForced labor is a form of human trafficking. It is not a wage dispute,\u2019\u2019 Rollins said. \u201cLabor trafficking is real and happening every day in Massachusetts and beyond. We are working hard to expose this disturbing crime and to hold those that abuse and traffic people accountable.\u201dPapantoniadis, who lives in Westwood, could not be reached for comment. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. His detention hearing is scheduled for March 20 at 11:30 a.m.",

      "body": "The latest iteration of The State of Race, a collaboration between GBH, The World, The Boston Globe and the Boston NAACP, will tackle the question: Are women of color on the rise? GBH\u2019s Morning Edition co-host Paris Alston be moderating the panel of women leaders making waves and tackling challenges in the realms of health care, academia, business policy and government. One of the panelists, Eneida Rom\u00e1n, the CEO of Amplify Latinx, joined Paris to talk ahead of the event. This transcript has been lightly edited. The State of Race: Are Women of Color on the Rise? will be held Thursday at 6 p.m. Free virtual tickets are available. Paris Alston: Thank you so much for joining us. And I want to talk about the event and everything that we're going to discuss. But first, I know that you are new in your role at Amplify Latinx. So tell me how things have been going and what your priorities are. Eneida Rom\u00e1n: Thank you so much, Paris. I'm delighted to be here, and I'm delighted to be part of the conversation tonight. As you said, I am new to my role at Amplify as CEO, but I'm not new to Amplify. I'm actually one of the co-founders. It's really delightful for me to see how we've grown and how we've expanded our reach. And so our goal is to actually close those opportunity gaps for Latinos and for women and other people of color through legislation that makes sense, through policy solutions that address these opportunity gaps. Alston: I'm glad you mentioned that, because I know that earlier this week you were at the State House, along with a number of other advocates and policymakers who were pushing for salary transparency bills that would require companies with 15 or more employees in Massachusetts to post their salary ranges and share the salaries of their employees. Tell me a little bit about how that will help level the playing field and what are the disparities that exist currently. Rom\u00e1n: That's an excellent question because there is a disparity, despite the fact that we had a wage equity bill passed in the past. This is a little bit different. And I just want to clarify that we can pass these bills without putting an employer at a competitive disadvantage and without burdensome reporting requirements. Because what we're asking is for employers of 100 employees or more to actually share with the state information that they already share with the federal government. The other bill is focused on posting the salary ranges for job openings. And there's at least a dozen other states who are doing this already. So in Massachusetts, we always pride ourselves on being innovative and being ahead of the curve, and being progressive when it comes to equity and inclusion. So this would be another way of ensuring that we are at the top of the game. Alston: You know, it's interesting, Eneida, because I think back to some of my early days and those conversations about salary negotiations were very foreign to me in many ways. I'm curious about your perspective about how that holds women of color back, and why it is important for people to be able to be transparent about these things. Rom\u00e1n: Absolutely. You're right, because I think that money tends to be a taboo subject for so many of us, and also negotiating on our behalf. I think as women, we're always taught that we want to take care of others, but we kind of put ourselves in the backseat. And I think that also translates into how we negotiate on behalf of others, but not so much on our behalf. And so it's very interesting how we can distinguish between fairness and deserving something, right? As women, we tend to focus on, \"Well, that's fair.\" It's not so much that \"I deserve it.\" And I think there's a gender difference there where when a man is talking about his salary, he describes it as him being worthy of it. And so I think it's important that we normalize talking about our worth and about making sure that it's not selfish. It's something that benefits society in general. It benefits all of us because it it improves the GDP of the nation. It improves the economic prosperity of our families and the security of our homes. I think focusing on, normalizing the subject, and not seeing it as the taboo, because that, in fact, is something that really has affected our ability to negotiate on our behalf, on our own progress. Alston: It's interesting that we're going to be tackling this question tonight, as I mentioned: Are women of color on the rise? Because we see them in a number of leadership positions, including the one that you're in. We see them in state and federal government. We see them in higher education and in the business sector, etc., etc. But where do the disparities remain? Rom\u00e1n: First of all, the pay equity gap has not improved in 20 years, Right? So that's a reality. That's for women in general. Now, when you look at the pay equity gap for women generally, white women make $0.70 for every dollar their white [male] counterparts make. Now, if we start looking at that, at the numbers, the gap from April until the end of the year, we see that women of color fall even further behind. And so, of course, my focus is on Latinas. And in the work that I do, we see that Latinas literally make half of what their white counterparts make. So they essentially end up working double the time for the same amount of pay. This is due to a number of factors. There's many more Latinas and women of color in entry level positions. So of course the salaries are lower, and so the pathway to the top sometimes has certain obstacles. I think by creating this awareness and by finding policy solutions that help remove the barriers, we clear that path and we remove those roadblocks for women and women of color.",

      "body": "The Federal Aviation Administration held a safety summit in Washington Wednesday following a series of safety-related incidents at airports across the country. At the summit, the recent dramatic increase in air travel and the need for better technology were cited as reasons for the rising number of close calls. But Logan Airport \u2014 where one of those recent incidents occurred \u2014 is one of 43 airports across the country that have been outfitted by the FAA with the latest technology to deter potential collisions.On Feb. 27, a LearJet began taking off on a runway at Logan Airport that crossed the landing path of an arriving JetBlue flight. The JetBlue plane suddenly aborted its landing to avoid collision. The circumstances that led to this close hall are still under investigation by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board.David Ishihara, director of aviation services at Logan, attended the FAA safety summit. On Thursday, he explained to Massport\u2019s board that Logan was an early adopter of two safety systems to help prevent collisions. One is a ground-based radar that allows pilots to see both vehicles and other airplanes on the ground. It also will alert the pilot and control tower if an airplane on final approach is not headed for the runway on which it is cleared to land. The other safety system is a network of runway status lights installed along taxiways and runways throughout the airport. They flash red and warn pilots of potential conflicts between planes taking off and landing. Ishihara said that light system will be expanded this summer. Massport Director of Aviation Ed Freni reminded the board that all the radar systems that Ishihara referenced are maintained and installed by the FAA and not within Massport\u2019s control.",

      "body": "The past few days have been a whirlwind for Holy Cross women\u2019s basketball. They beat their rivals down the turnpike, Boston University, 66-61 on Sunday to bring the Patriot League conference title to Worcester. That earned the Crusaders a bid in the NCAA Tournament, where on Friday they\u2019ll face off against Maryland, the No. 2 seed in their region of the bracket. And they are the only Division I program in Massachusetts to make it to the tournament this year.Junior forward Janelle Allen said it all doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s true yet. \u201cSo, I feel like once we start, you know, getting on the bus and loading up our stuff, it\u2019s gonna hit us like, \u2018Wow, we\u2019re actually here,\u2019\u201d Allen said before practice on Wednesday. Over the course of just a few days, the Crusaders have had to balance the elation of earning the program\u2019s 13th-ever invite to the Big Dance with the daunting task of being a Cinderella facing off against one of the best teams in the country. But for head coach Maureen Magarity\u2019s squad, there\u2019s joy in just getting this far. And a quiet confidence that they can maybe bust a few brackets. Magarity is no stranger to what this moment means for a player: In 2000, she was a first-year student at Boston College when the Eagles advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. And in 2004, she was a senior on the Marist squad that made the program\u2019s first-ever trip to the NCAA Tournament. They lost in the first-round to Oklahoma, but the memory still shines bright for Magarity. \u201cAnd to be able to go to the Big Dance with your best friends is still one of my most cherished moments of my entire life, besides the birth of my children to be honest, you know?\u201d she said with a chuckle. \u201cAnd we were the first team in school history to bring Marist to the NCAAs and there was five of us seniors. So, I just kind of explained to the players about how great it is to do it with people that you love and your best friends.\u201dIt's a sentiment that her players already understand. Addisyn Cross is the only senior for Holy Cross this season. Her freshman year, the Crusaders\u2019 season was cut short when the Patriot League canceled its tournament amid the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, that journey is getting a storybook ending. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for a better way to finish out my senior year,\u201d Cross said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna look back on these memories for forever. I mean, last Sunday was probably the best day of my life. So, this is just an incredible experience, and I\u2019m so glad I get to experience it with my team.\u201dOn Friday, the March Madness dream will become a reality when Holy Cross faces off against Maryland on the Terrapins\u2019 home court. It will be just the third time the two programs have met, with the first being Holy Cross\u2019 only win in prior NCAA Tournaments, all the way back in 1991. This time, they\u2019ll meet a program led by head coach Brenda Frese that won a national title in 2006 and that\u2019s picked up multiple wins against Top 10 teams this season. If there\u2019s any chance for Holy Cross to notch its second NCAA Tournament win in program history, players like Bronagh Power-Cassidy \u2014 who scored 21 points against BU in the conference title game and was named the championship MVP \u2014 will have to play some of their best basketball. To that end, the junior guard is looking to funnel the emotions of an exciting week into the game. \u201cOne of the things we continuously told ourselves across the entire Patriot League tournament was just be present in that moment and focus on each possession, each play. Every minute we\u2019re out there, we\u2019re fighting,\u201d Power-Cassidy said. \u201cSo I think just riding this high and we\u2019re on this roll right now, so I think if we just continue that and use the emotions from the past couple of weeks to just kind of push us on and continue to focus on each moment and to keep fighting, I think that\u2019s just the best way we\u2019re gonna head into this.\u201dMagarity knows that Maryland will be a huge challenge for the Crusaders. At practice Wednesday, she pointed out the Terrapins\u2019 size, athleticism and pressure on the ball. But she also acknowledged her team\u2019s strengths, like the Crusaders\u2019 stingy defense, which has given up just 54.8 points per game this season. And while most people probably have Maryland locked in to win, the magic of March Madness is that anything can happen.\u201cWe know it\u2019s gonna be a tough test and we have all the respect in the world for Maryland, but why not?\u201d Magarity said. \u201cLet\u2019s just see what happens and have fun with it and I\u2019m really excited to see how the team performs.\u201d",

      "body": "Updated at 11:57 a.m. March 10SeparatorThe MBTA announced Thursday night it was immediately slowing trains across the entire system because of safety concerns. As of Friday morning, most of those restrictions are no longer in place.Speed limits remain in effect on Green Lines and the Mattapan Trolley, with trains not exceeding 10-25 miles an hour, depending on the location. Normally speeds vary by line but top out at 40 mph.Agency officials explained that the decision was made following recent track testing and a site visit by the Department of Public Utilities. The agency uses an ultrasonic system to detect track defects that may not be visible to the naked eye \u2014 from spacing between the rails being too tight to a slight twist in the rails \u2014 and testing from that system showed inconsistencies they needed to follow up on.\"This decision that we made yesterday to slow the trains down globally was done out of an abundance of caution for their safety. And that is something right now that we have to remain completely committed to,\" interim MBTA General Manager Jeff Gonneville said at a press conference Friday.Gonneville said he expects inspections to take a couple days. He could not predict when the remaining restrictions would be lifted, because that depends on whether inspectors identify areas of track that need repair.\"Frankly, this is all part of ensuring that the T is safe,\" he said. \"Safe for our customers, safe for our employees.\"The MBTA has been running trains with speed restrictions over some parts of the system because of track work and safety concerns over months, notably on sections of the Orange Line after they reopened following a 30-day shutdown in August and September. The agency announced other disruptions Friday morning: Shuttle buses replaced the Mattapan trolley along the entirety of its route, from Mattapan Square to Ashmont, until just after 8 a.m. Friday; and a power outage meant Blue Line trains were replaced with shuttle buses between Maverick and Suffolk Downs. On Thursday, the MBTA\u2019s chief safety officer, Ronald Ester Jr., told the MBTA\u2019s board that the Department of Public Utilities, which oversees the MBTA, found a few pressing issues. \u201cThe DPU identified several issues that resulted in some immediate action letters being issued to the MBTA,\u201d Ester said. \u201cThey were: Priority 1one track conditions, third rail insulators, electrical access boxes on the right of way, headlight operation within the tunnels, PPE compliance and safety briefings.\u201d Commuters Friday mornings responded to the slowdowns with a mixture of frustration and resignation.\u201cI would love to see the T function better because I think it\u2019s important to have a system like this. So many people rely on it,\u201d said Laura Hewlett, on her way to work as a teacher. \u201cI rely on it too. But I\u2019d love to know that it goes faster than me running.

      "body": "Advocates for a stronger rent control policy dominated the Boston City Council\u2019s second public hearing on the issue Thursday, ratcheting up pressure to alter the controversial plan put forward last month by Mayor Michelle Wu.Wu has repeatedly defended her proposal as balanced. It would cap annual rent increases at a maximum of 10% in high inflation years, and the rate of inflation plus 6% in most other years. Her rent control plan would also exempt recently constructed buildings for 15 years, as well as landlords who own six units or fewer and live on-site with their tenants. Thursday\u2019s commenters insisted the mayor's proposal be tightened to counter a rising tide of unaffordability by shortening the building exemption period and lowering the annual rent increase cap to a maximum of 5%.\u201cWe\u2019re asking for just rents,\u201d East Boston resident Maribel Castro said through an interpreter. Castro said she is currently trying to cope with a rent increase brought on by a new landlord seeking $3,000 a month for a two-bedroom apartment.\u201cAnd that\u2019s not fair. \u2026 We\u2019re asking Michelle Wu, the mayor, to do something about it [and] also all of you,\u201d she said to the sitting councilors.James Cordero, a public school teacher and Dorchester resident, asked the council to \u201crefine\u201d the rent control policy to ensure more renters are protected. \u201cThat means this 10% cap really should be reduced to a 5% cap including inflation \u2026 and we really need to make sure that this policy applies to as many properties as possible, including those properties that are new construction,\u201d Cordero said. Natalie Bell, a Dorchester homeowner, testified that her ability to purchase a home was \u201conly made possible\u201d through her partner\u2019s access to generational wealth. \u201cOur housing cost \u2026 is about one half of the market rate I see for comparable rental units,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy is 6% plus inflation even being called 'rent control' at all? It sounds kind of like profit allowance,\" Bell said. \"I want to close by asking if you can imagine legislating that the wage of every renter in the city would also go up 6% plus inflation, because if we can\u2019t picture that happening, then we should grapple with what is happening, which is that we\u2019re privileging an investor class at the expense of everyone else.\u201d Until now, the criticism of Wu's rent control plan came principally from organized interests such as the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, which launched a $400,000 public campaign against the policy, and MassLandlords, which recently filed a lawsuit seeking documents related to how Wu chose the members of her rent control advisory committee.The hearing came after repeated rallies across the state in support of a lower cap on annual rent increases. In January, advocates gathered in front of the State House, insisting that a 5% maximum would keep rental rates stable and be more in line with stagnant wages. Last week, at the City Council\u2019s first hearing on Wu\u2019s proposed policy, councilors began signaling ways they might attempt to change the plan. At Thursday's public hearing, several councilors applauded Wu\u2019s effort to initiate public discussion on a wedge issue and indicated a desire to amend her proposal.\u201cThis is a historic moment, yes,\u201d said Councilor Kendra Lara, who has publicly stated she wants the rental cap lowered. \u201cAnd I want to commend Mayor Wu for being able to take the step to take the step to even put this on the floor in front of us \u2014 but what good is a historic moment if we\u2019re going to squander it?\u201d \u201cOne question I\u2019m just wondering about [is] how we ended up at CPI plus 6%,\u201d said Councilor Liz Breadon.Breadon added: \u201cI really applaud Mayor Wu \u2026 but, I feel that we need to really scrutinize the numbers a bit more to see if we can improve the situation.\u201dCouncilor Ricardo Arroyo cited census data that shows Boston has already lost thousands of Black residents in the past couple decades. \u201cI have no doubt that that has to do with the cost of living. ... So I think this is an incredibly important step to do this for rent stabilization,\u201d he said, \u201cand I recognize that for people who have already been displaced, this comes too late.\u201dCouncilor Brian Worrell echoed concerns expressed by small landlords including a need for increased rental assistance and the need for housing production \u201con top of\u201d a rent control policy.Councilor Kenzie Bok echoed Wu's assertion that the proposal on the table balances the interests of renters and housing creators.Councilors are scheduled to hold a technical session to begin proposing adjustments to the policy next week.",

      "body": "Gov. Maura Healey used her speech to the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce Thursday to pitch the various components of her tax relief package and $55.5 billion budget as a down payment on the state\u2019s future, saying she sees a \u201cbig need\u201d to improve the quality of life for Massachusetts families. Healey told the crowd of nearly 800 people gathered at the Westin Copley Place that the conversation around quality of life starts with affordability. She said her budget and tax plan propose ways to lower costs, improve schools, train workers and grow the state\u2019s economy, and that those measures are central to keeping Massachusetts competitive with other states. \u201cWe need to make Massachusetts more affordable if we want to attract and retain talent, and we need to connect workers with job opportunities and create that pipeline, and we need to do it yesterday,\u201d Healey said. As one pathway into the workforce, Healey highlighted a $20 million plan in her budget to make community college free for adults age 25 and up. Healey\u2019s budget would boost state spending 4% over this year. Along with it, she filed a $742 million package of tax reforms that features breaks for renters, seniors, and people caring for children under 13 and other dependentsTwo pieces of Healey\u2019s tax package \u2014 a lower tax rate for short-term capital gains and a higher threshold for the estate tax, so it would kick in for estates valued at $3 million instead of the current $1 million \u2014 earned praise from business groups like the Chamber, but sparked criticism from progressive circles.\"By spending hundreds of millions of dollars on permanent tax giveaways to the wealthy, the governor\u2019s budget proposal limits the state's ability to make even greater investments in public higher education today, and threatens the state\u2019s ability to fully fund public education from pre-K through college in future years,\" Vatsady Sivongxay, executive director of the Massachusetts Education Justice Alliance, said in her statement. In an interview later Thursday on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio, Healey defended her moves on the estate and short-term capital gains taxes as ways to bring Massachusetts\u2019 tax policy more in line with other states. \u201cOnly 12 states even have an estate tax, and at a million dollars, \u2026 we have the lowest cap in the country, along with the state of Oregon, so you know, I understand this is a subject of debate,\u201d Healey said. \u201cBut honestly, I am focused on affordability and I am focused on competitiveness and making sure that residents and families are able to grow and thrive here in the state. She said Massachusetts is an outlier as well on its capital gains tax, as one of only three states that tax short-term capital gains at a higher rate than gains on assets held for longer than a year. Healey covered several other topics during her radio appearance. In other budget matters, Healey said she\u2019s proposing the highest-ever level of funding for the Massachusetts Cultural Council, at $25 million, as well as the largest amount of funding for K-12 education. She voiced support for banning ghost guns, untraceable weapons that are assembled through parts often bought online or made with 3-D printers. \u201cWe need to do everything we can to get rid of them,\u201d Healey said, describing the emergence of ghost guns as a serious issue across the country. Responding to a question from a Barnstable High School student visiting the Boston Public Library on a field trip, Healey said her administration will work to bring younger people\u2019s voices to the table and that she \u201cmight even have a youth council of my own\u201d at some point. She said she\u2019ll back President Joe Biden if he seeks another term in the White House as expected.",

      "body": "Households in Massachusetts that use federal SNAP benefits to help pay for food will see the amount they receive drop by an average of $150 after today. That's because a federal COVID-era enhancement of the program is coming to an end.\"It will impact the entire caseload, which is 640,000 households and over a million residents,\" said Brittany Mangini, associate commissioner for food security and nutrition programs at the state Department of Transitional Assistance.\"I think, unfortunately, it's going to really undermine a lot of the efforts that we have to mitigate food insecurity across the Commonwealth,\" Mangini said. \"But one thing that we've done, is try to be as proactive as possible with getting information out to folks so that we can address the impact that it's going to have on their overall household budget.\"The state set up a website detailing resources to help people reduce the impact of the loss in food assistance, Mangini said.Advocates for food security in Massachusetts say the sunsetting of the federal SNAP expansion is coming at a difficult moment, with food prices and other expenses especially high.\"We are worried because we're doing everything we can,\" said Catherine Lynn of the Greater Boston Food Bank. \"At a time when we're already seeing elevated need and demand on our system, and at a time when food, gas, energy, housing, medical... [and] childcare costs are through the roof, the cost of living is so expensive... every single income stream is going to be so important.\" Lynn said she expects the sudden drop in benefits to increase reliance on assistance from the Greater Boston Food Bank, which distributes food to 600 food pantries, meal programs, shelters and markets around the state.\"We know that this support has directly helped people put food on the table and to alleviate that worry about feeding themselves and feeding their kids,\" said Erin McAleer of Project Bread. \"The folks that are calling Project Bread are worried. We talked just earlier this week to a senior citizen from Fitchburg who says she'll now be receiving only 23 dollars a month.\"Governor Maura Healey's supplemental budget approved Wednesday by the state House of Representatives included $130 million to enhance SNAP benefits for the next three months. Lynn said that would be enough to cover 40 percent of the reduction during that period.\"What I proposed doing through that Senate budget was providing people a little bit more of a glide path so it wouldn't be so abrupt,\" Healey said Thursday on GBH's Greater Boston. \"So that people wouldn't go from, you know, overnight losing what's estimated to be an average of $150 a month.\"The state Senate is expected to consider the supplemental budget next week.\"Massachusetts has a real opportunity here to be a leader,\" Lynn said. \"I have high confidence that the legislature is going to pass this supplemental budget, and I think it will make a difference and a huge impact in terms of ... [reducing] that shock that people are going to feel. And so it won't be feeling like someone's pulling a rug underneath them.\" But the supplemental budget, Lynn pointed out, does not include any increased funding to cover increased reliance on food banks like hers. \"So we are talking to our legislators,\" she said. \"In a state of emergency, ensuring that the emergency food system is sustained with the right level of funding is going to be critical.\" This story includes reporting by Mary Blake.",

      "body": "Local disability organizations hosted a rally in Boston Wednesday to call for better wages and working conditions for personal care attendants, or PCAs, who support people with disabilities and help them live independently. Advocates say the state program faces a \u201ccrisis\u201d of staffing shortages. More than 100 PCAs and the people who rely on them made their way from the 32BJ SEIU union hall to The Embrace statue on the Boston Common, and then marched into the State House to deliver a letter with demands to Gov. Maura Healey\u2019s office. They are asking the governor to increase the hourly PCA wage to $25, improve benefits and retirement security, and provide better job training for career advancement.The MassHealth PCA program provides support to people with disabilities who live at home to help them stay out of nursing homes. PCAs, who are hired and managed by the disabled consumer, help with daily tasks like getting out of bed, showering, dressing and preparing food. There are more than 58,000 PCAs in the state \u2014 mostly women of color \u2014 but the workforce is not large enough to support everyone who needs them.PCAs currently make $17.80 an hour, which will go up to $18 on April 1. Advocates say further increasing pay will attract more people to the job by competing with rising wages in other industries.Because of the staffing shortage, some people can\u2019t find personal care attendants and are forced to rely on family and friends. Ellie Vargas said that without PCAs, her mother has had to fill in to care for her, even though she isn\u2019t a trained healthcare worker.\u201cMy mother is 65 years old. She can't do this anymore, you know? So it's not only having issues with housing, but I'm having PCA issues for the last three-plus years,\u201d she said.\u201cIt's just been horror story after horror story,\u201d she said. Vargas added that her physical health has suffered because she is often left without help. \u201cThese people [PCAs] work way too hard to get a little measly check, that they can't invest in their own insurance.\u201dQuincy resident Dan Harris said that he wouldn\u2019t be able to live on his own without personal care attendants. \u201cI\u2019m a person with a disability who relies on personal care attendants to be able to live the most independent life that I can,\u201d he said outside Healey\u2019s office. \u201cAnd I feel like I\u2019m fighting for my life, because personal care attendants are my lifeline to the community.\u201d State Sen. Lydia Edwards was also at the rally, which was sponsored by healthcare union 1199SEIU, the Boston Center for Independent Living and numerous other elderly support and disability organizations.Edwards\u2019 mother was a personal care attendant, and she says that she saw firsthand how vital their work is, yet they are often struggling themselves with low wages.\u201cIndependently living, with dignity and respect, supported by jobs that pay a living wage, is the only future I\u2019m going to accept,\u201d Edwards said in front of The Embrace statue. Deborah Stephens, a PCA who lives in Chicopee, says she regularly works 50 hours a week, the maximum she is allowed, to help cover other PCAs when they\u2019re unable to work. Better benefits, like more sick time, would help, she said.\u201cIf I get sick, they [the consumers] don't have anyone to take care of them. I don't have sick wages. I only have PTO,\u201d she said while marching through the Common. \u201cI'm 61 years old. I'm approaching retirement age myself, but I want to be able to have something to retire with.\u201dIsaias Ruiz, a PCA who says he finds his work rewarding, said that the state should pay healthcare workers more, and also help them pay for expensive certifications. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to work three or four jobs to make ends meet,\u201d he said at the labor union hall. \u201cAnd we should be able to save and invest for retirement.\u201dBefore taking office, Healey pledged to support the PCA program and improve conditions. Marchers hope she keeps that promise, and improves the home care system as the state\u2019s population ages.\u201cThis will affect all of us because sooner or later \u2014 I will get old. You'll get old. What happens then? We\u2019re just going to fail the elderly,\u201d Vargas said.Have your sayGBH News is teaming up for statewide coverage of Gov.

The clinic currently provides area residents with access to clinical staff, methadone clinics, emergency triage and resources to cope with withdrawal and intoxication \u2014 all efforts to reduce strain on nearby emergency rooms.The city will continue to provide transitional housing at the Roundhouse Hotel until the end of June, and is currently \u201clooking for other sites to decentralize\u201d while \u201cevaluating what options are available to us\u201d in the interim, according to a spokesman for Mayor Michelle Wu.\u201cAny reduction in services is going to negatively impact the population of people experiencing homelessness and people who use drugs,\u201d said Azzy Mae, a harm reduction activist and member of the New England Users Union, a local advocacy group for people who use drugs. \u201cWith the warmer months approaching, it\u2019s important that the services are near where folks are congregating. It\u2019s definitely not the time to be reducing services.\u201d The closure comes after months of stalled negotiations between Boston Medical Center and neighborhood groups on a memorandum of agreement about a long-term plan and final end date for services at the Roundhouse. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the services aren\u2019t necessary, just not there,\u201d said Sue Sullivan, executive director of the Newmarket Business Association, who suggested the creation of an \u201cenclave\u201d of housing and clinical support in another part of Roxbury, Dorchester or South Boston. \u201cI see loitering, vandalism and aggressive panhandling. For those reasons, all the neighboring businesses will be very glad to see them leave.\u201dThe Roundhouse is one of several low-threshold housing sites established for unhoused people at Mass. and Cass, including Willow at Woods Mullen, Southampton Dorm 1 and the Envision Hotel. The city budgeted $21,269,552 in federal funding to support these sites through the end of this year, and 180 residents are currently living across six sites, according to data provided by the city. Other services will continue in the area, including city- and federal grant\u2013funded programs and clinical services at the Engagement Center on Atkinson Street, harm reduction efforts through the AHOPE program, and city collaborations with nonprofits including the Whittier Street Health Center and Victory Programs, according to the Boston Public Health Commission. \u201cWe are grateful to our partners at BMC for their collaboration in supporting the city\u2019s public health response to the substance use and homelessness crises at Mass. and Cass,\u201d a Boston Public Health Commission spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the commission will continue \u201cto direct individuals to their day spaces so they can access the wraparound services they need.\u201dPeople experiencing homelessness have been \u201cforced into a concentration at Mass. and Cass,\u201d May said, an already disenfranchised area of the city that has grappled for years with a lack of resources and support. \u201cIf we want to decentralize, if we want folks to be enmeshed in society in a way that they can be accepted, then we need to have programs all over the place,\u201d they said. \u201cBut in the meantime, we need to meet people where they\u2019re at \u2014 and not just in a philosophical sense. We need proximity.\u201d",

      "body": "By now you\u2019ve heard that Mayor Michelle Wu vetoed the proposal to restore an elected school committee and reverse Boston\u2019s position as an outlier with the only mayor-appointed school committee in the commonwealth. What you may not know: She recently signed a separate piece of legislation that would make Boston an outlier in a new, different way by giving voting power to the school committee\u2019s student representatives. The Boston School Committee currently has one non-voting student representative. The measure now headed to the statehouse would add spots for two voting student representatives and an alternate. The Boston Student Advisory Council would elect the positions.It\u2019s an under-the-radar aspect of the school committee scuffle, but one that those at the intersection of youth and civic engagement say could have far-reaching implications if it clears the now daunting Beacon Hill process. Currently, Boston School Committee student reps \u2014 those that represent the interests of stakeholders with the greatest interest in Boston Public Schools \u2014 lack a say in the policies and decisions that directly impact BPS\u2019 49,000 or so students.Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director at the Tufts-based, nonpartisan Center for Information Research & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), says that\u2019s an issue.\u201cStudent voice is essential. ... Young people have the most immediate, current and deepest knowledge about what's happening in their own classroom and in their curriculum. And nobody else can comment about what the actual student experiences are,\u201d she told GBH News. \u201cIt's the kind of expertise the school board needs to be able to make decisions together with young people that actually reflect student views, experience and opinions.\u201d Advocates like Kawashima-Ginsberg see student suffrage as a preferred way to promote civic engagement and do it while the youth are still in school, able to engage with their peers as well as adults.But Glenn Koocher, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, said Boston could be \u201copening up a can of worms\u201d by allowing students to have a vote because of their stakeholder status. \u201cThen the union president is going to want to vote, then the special education PAC is going to want to vote, and everybody is going to have a legitimate claim to demanding a voice at the table,\u201d Koocher told GBH News. \u201cSo at some point you've got to default to the traditional rules of democracy and say if you're elected, you get a seat at the table and a vote.\u201d In addition to the slippery stakeholder slope, Koocher said there\u2019s \u201ca legitimate question regarding how students become fully and responsibly aware of their obligations to think critically and fairly.\u201d To be clear, the Massachusetts Association of School Committees generally abstains from taking sides on school committee governance questions in honor of local control.\u201cWe support the right of the community to make its own decision about how to elect its local elected officials,\u201d Koocher said. \u201cSo whatever Boston determines is for Boston and not for us\u201d to determine.The Boston School Committee, through a BPS communications official, declined to comment. The matter now moves to the Legislature, which, as it often does, will determine what Boston can and cannot do.SeparatorThis story first ran in GBH News\u2019 politics newsletter.

      "body": "Labor law expert Terri Gerstein has one word to describe the current trends in child labor: \u201cbizarre.\u201d Recent investigations by The New York Times, the Boston Globe and Reuters revealed cases where kids as young as 12 were working in meatpacking plants, fish processing plants, construction and car factories. Coupled with this surge in child labor law violations, Gerstein said, is a movement by certain state legislatures to remove existing protections. In Arkansas, for example, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed a bill that rolls back age verification requirements for children under 16. Iowa and Minnesota are also considering bills that loosen child labor age restrictions and workplace safety requirements. \u201cIt\u2019s bizarre they\u2019re happening at the same time because when we see an uptick in child labor, logically, that should be when we actually strengthen our laws and try to think about what we can do to protect children,\u201d Gerstein, a fellow at the Center for Labor and a Just Economy at Harvard Law School and the Economic Policy Institute, said on Boston Public Radio. \u201cOur child laws basically prevent kids from doing dangerous work and also from working such long hours that it's harmful to their physical development and their ability to go to school,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I talk about this upsurge in child labor violations, it includes both types.\u201dThere\u2019s a variety of factors contributing to this troubling national trend. There has been an increase in unaccompanied minors entering the United States, who are often the children at the center of these labor law violations. Combine that with a workforce shortage due to the COVID-19 pandemic and some adult workers declining to hold jobs with low wages and poor benefits. Companies have turned to the growing pool of migrant children to fill their place, Gerstein said.Many recognizable brands have been cited in these violations, like Cheerios, Walmart, Target and General Motors. These companies have mostly been able to avoid punishment, however, by placing the blame on staffing and temp agencies, subcontractors and franchises who directly hired the children. Gerstein said there needs to be a \u201cchain of liability\u201d in the supply chains of companies that have child labor so that if a subcontractor violates workers' rights, the general contractor is still held accountable.The government has sometimes failed to enforce these laws because federal workplace agencies \u201chave been starved of funds for years and years,\u201d Gerstein said. Additionally, the number of U.S. Department of Labor Wage & Hour Division investigators declined by a quarter between 2010-2019, while the number of workers per investigator more than doubled since 1979. While federal enforcement is stretched thin, many states don\u2019t even have state-level investigators, Gerstein added.Some lawmakers are taking action. A bipartisan bill introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives in March will increase penalties for companies found guilty of child labor law violations. While harshening penalties is important, Gerstein cautioned that companies may still not be deterred from putting children in unsafe conditions if they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll get caught. \u201cAny improvements in these laws I think is really valuable and important,\u201d said Gerstein. But to really make change, Gerstein said this bill needs to be combined with other measures, like stronger unions for children and work permits for unaccompanied minors that will allow them to secure more appropriate jobs in law-abiding, safer workplaces.",

      "body": "On a cold, late-winter evening in Roxbury, staccato rhythms punctuated by crashing cymbals flowed from a stately Victorian house on Elm Hill Avenue, where a group of students practiced their drumline formation in the basement. Eighteen-year-old Alan Aunaxe beat a message on his snare drum, then cast a look at a fellow drummer in a playful call and response. \u201cI want everything to sound clean,\u201d Aunaxe said afterward. \u201cYou have to be precise, or else it\u2019s going to sound like a splash.\u201dDrumlines might be a fixture in the U.S. South, but in Boston they are about as common as cheesy grits. Among Boston\u2019s 30 public high schools, there\u2019s just one active marching band \u2014 at English High School. The Hamilton-Garrett Center for Music & Arts decided to create its own drumline as a way to honor African American musical tradition in a city that sometimes overlooks it. \u201cDrumming has a profound importance within Black culture here in the United States of America,\u201d said the Rev. Dr. Emmett Price III, inaugural dean of Africana Studies at the Berklee College of Music.The drumline\u2019s esprit de corps lifts people up, celebrating African musical traditions and the regiments of Black fifers and drummers who fought in the Civil War. Price said it also recalls an era when drumming was a form of resistance, especially when it was banned among enslaved people in the United States.\u201cThere were rebellions that occurred because folks were signaling to each other using drums. Almost like Morse code,\u201d Price said.Against that backdrop, historically Black colleges and universities, also known as HBCUs, turned drumlines at halftime shows into a cultural phenomenon, making appearances with Beyonc\u00e9 at Coachella and Lil Nas X at the Grammys. The drumlines of HBCUs were an inspiring force behind the scenes at Hamilton-Garrett in Boston.Gerami Groover-Flores, the program\u2019s executive director, said she would listen to her father, Rev. Dr. Gregory G. Groover, pastor of the Historic Charles Street African Methodist Episcopal Church, talk about the pride he felt in the marching band from his days at Morehouse College, an HBCU in Atlanta. \u201cThat was a space the historically Black colleges and universities provided for these talented musicians who, at a certain point in our history, did not have access to many of the predominately white [higher ed] institutions,\u201d Groover-Flores said.Groover-Flores left Berklee with undergraduate and graduate degrees, but the feeling resonated even as she studied music in Europe. \u201dI have a deep connection to it,\u201d she said.The drumline at Hamilton-Garrett was also in step with the center\u2019s vision as a space where young people can learn about their musical heritage.Ruth Hamilton, half of the center\u2019s namesake, began offering music lessons for children out of the Charles Street AME church in the early 2000s with just four students.Hamilton was a strong proponent of the Negro spirituals. Elta Garrett, a veteran Boston Public Schools teacher, helped manage the program as it grew. Last year, Groover-Flores wanted to expand the center\u2019s afterschool program in a meaningful way, drawing in new students and offering musical scholarships to those who can\u2019t afford classes at the center. A drumline seemed like a good fit. She brought in three Berklee students as coaches and began recruiting youth to try out. She benefitted from a pipeline of students who had played at the Charles Street church\u2019s Sunday services. By September, she had about a dozen young people who continue to meet and practice together twice or more a week, often for several hours at a time.Less than six months after its start, the students had one of their first performances at Boston Arts Academy as part of its MLK Day celebration.The drumline has become a second family for Amari Ruffin-Lacy, who is just 12 years old and plays a bass drum that\u2019s almost as big as him. \u201cMy mom says I been playing the drums since I was in her belly,\u201d he said.As a preschooler, his mom brought him to Guitar City to play drums while she\u2019d sing. More recently, a grade-school teacher also noticed his love of drumming and won a grant to buy him his first drum kit.\u201cI\u2019ll never forget that drum set,\u201d Ruffin-Lacy said.On that recent cold and cloudy winter evening in Boston, the drumline members gathered in the basement of the Roxbury music center. Aunaxe, one of the drumline leaders, directed the practice. A college student studying biochemistry at Curry College, he\u2019s been playing drums in church since he was in second grade at the Charles Street church.\u201cI love music more than ... more than anything,\u201d Aunaxe said. \u201cI want us to grow. I want people to see us, I want people to know who we are.\u201dAs the group practices the New Orleans Second Line classic, \u201cDo Whatcha Wanna,\u201d the group wordlessly understands their roles and riffs. At one point, tenor drummer Marvin Ripert makes his quint set echo the sound of steel drums from the Caribbean.Groover-Flores said the group intentionally incorporates Afro-Latin sounds as a nod to Boston\u2019s large international population spanning the African diaspora. Aunaxe said that allows the Hamilton-Garrett drumline to produce a unique sound. One that he wants his hometown of Boston to hear.",

      "body": "Massachusetts officials unveiled a new initiative Thursday to make it easier for people returning from state prisons to obtain a state-issued ID \u2014 considered a critical first step for successful reentry after incarceration.Under the new agreement signed last fall, the Registry of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Correction pledged to coordinate information on inmates coming up for release so that they can be issued a state ID by the time they leave prison. Under the agreement, the RMV will have a mobile work unit that can travel to correctional facilities to help process the IDs.At a roundtable celebrating the agreement Thursday, Department of Correction Commissioner Carol Mici said that since the deal was reached, the two departments have been implementing changes and she has already seen an increasing number of people with IDs upon release. \u201cFifty percent of [eligible] people released in the last two months have received an ID,\u201d she said, which is about 15-20% higher than the same period last year. Jamal Gooding, a formerly incarcerated person who founded and runs an organization in Brockton called People Affecting Community Change said an ID is critical for nearly every facet of daily life \u2014 banking, job applications, medical care, even housing in a shelter.\u201cA guy coming home tomorrow that doesn't have an ID is the biggest public health issue,\u201d Gooding said. \u201cBecause if you can't get any money \u2026 they are liable to go and rob, steal or beg.\u201d Gooding said he and other community groups, working with the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, have been pushing for months for the Correction and Transportation departments to figure out a way to make it easier for people to obtain a state ID before they walk out of prison. State Sen. James Eldridge told GBH News he has been lobbying the agencies to make these changes for nearly a decade.\u201cTo guarantee that every incarcerated person upon release gets a state ID, that should not have taken nine years, but it did because of bureaucracy, because of that cultural opposition towards supporting incarcerated people,\u201d Eldridge said. Eldridge said he hopes more changes to the state\u2019s corrections system move faster under the Healey administration than they did under former Gov. Charlie Baker.Since 2018, Massachusetts has increased the requirements for a person to prove their identity in order to get a state-issued ID or driver\u2019s license. Applicants are required to provide proof of citizenship or lawful presence, a Social Security number, and Massachusetts residency \u2014 usually with a recent utility bill or other official mail sent to their Massachusetts address.People who have been incarcerated may not have access to any of those documents \u2014 but the Department of Correction certainly knows and has confirmed the identities of the people they are holding, Gooding points out. The agreement between the two agencies thus far only applies to people who had state-issued IDs before their incarceration, so the Registry of Motor Vehicles has their records on file.Getting these two agencies to cooperate to provide IDs to people about to leave prison is a huge first step, Gooding said. But he also noted the agreement \u201cdoes not go far enough because it does not touch every returning citizen. It is only applicable to those who have already had a Mass. ID or a permit or a license. If you never had any one of those, then you are not already in the Registry's system. And so now we got to figure out how we address this?\u201dAndrew Peck, the state\u2019s Undersecretary of Public Safety for Criminal Justice, said the two agencies plan to continue to expand the system with the hope of reaching some of the inmates in the categories Gooding highlighted.\u201cThis is a public safety issue,\u201d Peck said. \u201cThis is really about setting the foundation\u2026 We should help people and put them on that path to success.\u201dRoberto Rivera, who has been out of prison for four months, told state correctional officials Tuesday that starting his life again without any identification card was daunting.\u201cSo I came home. I don't even got an ID [like] I don't even exist. What am I going to do? I can't get a job, I can't drive, I can't do nothing,\u201d Rivera, 43, said during a roundtable discussion about reentry at the Boston Pre-Release Center in Roslindale.Rivera, who served time for dealing drugs, said that being without an ID made him think about returning to crime to sustain himself.The state Department of Corrections data dashboard indicates that the state completed about 1,800 criminal releases in 2021 \u2014 although it is possible some individuals were released more than once.The memorandum does not apply to county jails that are run by sheriffs\u2019 but funded by state taxpayers. Those jails released nearly 4,000 men and women to communities in Massachusetts in 2022, according to the latest state data.Makeeba McCreary, president of New Commonwealth Racial Equity and Social Justice Fund, said that several organizations her fund is working with as part of its prison reform initiative had raised IDs as a critical need.\u201cThey all rallied around this one issue that really stops any of the audience that they're serving from being able to access all the things that come next, which is housing, employment, health care, you know, you name it,\u201d McCreary said. \u201cApparently you can't do it if you don't have a piece of plastic with your face and name on it.\"",

      "body": "The temperature may not feel like it, but Opening Day at Fenway Park means spring has officially returned to Boston.Bundled up in a winter coat before Thursday's game at Fenway Park, Tammy Braz of Simsbury, Connecticut summed up how she was feeling.\"Cold!\" she said with a laugh. \"Cold but excited. And I hope we get a win today.\"In the end, she didn't get her wish. The Sox lost to the Baltimore Orioles 10-9, in an opener that was much closer in the end than appeared likely throughout much of the game.Before the game, Braz's husband, Tony, said after last year's last-place finish in the American League East, he's not feeling too optimistic about this season.\"I've been a fan since 1967, so I'm used to good years and bad years,\" he said. \"So, just hope for the best every year.\" As the weather warms up in the coming days and months, Sox fans are hoping their team heats up, too.\"It's going to be a little tough, but I think we'll be all right,\" said Novar Whitworth of Dedham, who comes to Opening Day every year with a group of college friends. \"We're always coming with a 'go' attitude, so we'll see how things go.\"His friend James Sullivan of Westborough was thinking about the Sox' chief baseball officer as this season gets started.\"Hoping for Chaim Bloom's sake that team get some wins this year,\" Sullivan said. \"I think he's on the hot seat for sure.\" In addition to new rules intended to speed up the game, there are a number of new faces on the team this year that Bloom is hoping will energize the Red Sox. Those include left fielder Masataka Yoshida, who was signed from his home team in Japan.After the shock of losing All-Star shortstop Xander Bogaerts to the San Diego Padres this season, the Sox signed a record deal to keep star third baseman Rafael Devers.\"It's just a lot of hope,\" said Kim Hearst of North Attleboro. \"I'm not so sure that keeping Raffi [Devers] was all we were going to need to do, but let's hope that keeping Raffi brings enough spark to the team so that we can enjoy the year.\"\"I'm not expecting a playoff run from this team,\" said Hearst's husband, Hal. \"But I'm expecting a lot of good baseball, a fun team to watch. And it's going to be a fun year.\" The Red Sox finished last season with a record of 78 wins and 84 losses. The previous year they made a surprise run into the post-season, ultimately losing the American League Championship Series 4-2 to the Houston Astros.\"I don't know,\" Parker Silva of Attleboro said of the team's chances. \"They've lost a lot of talent. They've picked up some. I'm hoping for [the Sox to] go back to the playoffs again. But, we'll see. It's a long season. Everybody stays healthy, you never know what could happen. You know?\"New Sox starting pitcher Corey Kluber gave up a home run on just the second batter of the season and the Orioles were up 10-4 by the top of the 8th inning. But before the sold-out Fenway crowd could give in to despair, the Sox battled back, scoring five runs in the last two innings and bringing the game within one bat stroke of a win. Ultimately, a ninth-inning strikeout by Adam Duvall in his first game with the Sox brought the team's rally and hopes of an Opening Day win to an abrupt end.\"It's always disappointing,\" Sox manager Alex Cora said to the press after the game. \"You always want to win that first one. We'll try again next year.\"Sox fan Mike O'Neil of Rockland had mixed feelings on this lineup's debut performance.\"It was sloppy, but I'm OK with that,\" O'Neil said. \"I wish that we spent more money, and I saw that on the field today. But at the end of the day, I was OK with the product.\"The team's leadership needs to be more willing to invest in big players, O'Neil said.\"I think that this is a team that likes to compete. And that's what we've done the last five, six years is we have underdog teams that want to prove they're not underdogs,\" O'Neil said. \"But we're the Boston Red Sox and we're not supposed to be underdogs. We're supposed to be top dogs.\"",

      "body": "Top House Democrats plan to unveil and debate a \"comprehensive\" tax relief package in the next few weeks designed to make Massachusetts more affordable for its residents and \"more competitive with other states,\" according to Speaker Ronald Mariano, who pledged Thursday to deliver relief to people across the income spectrum.Mariano, who in recent months sounded a more cautious tone about whether the state could afford tax relief, said he expects the forthcoming bill to revive several measures lawmakers embraced and then spiked last term as well as some kind of increase to the estate tax threshold.He forecast the House's tax relief proposal will emerge \"just before\" the House Ways and Means Committee in April releases its fiscal year 2024 budget bill, which will also feature funding for universal school meals and a free community college program.The speaker's announcement, delivered in a speech to business leaders at a Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce event, tees up a new round of legislative debate on a topic from which lawmakers retreated last year.\"The House will soon release a comprehensive tax reform package aimed at providing responsible, permanent financial relief to all residents of the commonwealth, regardless of income status,\" Mariano told a crowd of business leaders.Several of the tax code changes in the pending legislation would be phased in over a multi-year period to ensure that they do not \"jeopardize the long-term financial security of the commonwealth,\" Mariano said, offering few details about what will be in the bill.Mariano said after his speech that all of the measures lawmakers initially approved last year \"will be considered again.\" In a question-and-answer session with chamber president Jim Rooney, Mariano said of reforms to the estate tax, \"It's pretty much assumed you're going to see that in the package.\" And asked by reporters if the House's bill would propose slashing the short-term capital gains tax \u2014 a Gov. Maura Healey-endorsed measure that both branches left out of last session's ultimately doomed bill \u2014 Mariano replied, \"Everything's on the table.\"The Quincy Democrat said he wants the bottom line to \"come in at a meaningful number,\" but added that discussions are still taking place about both the overall package size and the scope of each individual form of relief.\"We're still putting all the pieces together. This is, you know, four or five or six moving pieces, so we're trying to get something that's fair and balanced,\" he said.After Democrats pushed through a new surtax on wealthier residents expected to general more than a billion dollars a year in new revenue, tax increases do not appear likely to feature in the bill.\"After riding the [American Rescue Plan Act] high, I don't want to be talking about raising taxes. It's not something that any of us, especially sitting at table 11, are interested in,\" Mariano said, referring to the table where his core leadership team was seated for the Chamber event.Mariano also gave a glimpse at two highlights of the upcoming House budget bill: it will include funding to make permanent a pandemic-era universal school meals program originally launched with federal dollars, and it will embrace a Healey proposal to make community college free for Bay Staters older than 25 who do not have a college degree.He told reporters the price tag for the community college measure, which Healey dubbed \"MassReconnect,\" might be more than the $20 million the governor sought for the program. Pressed by Rep. Natalie Higgins at a hearing this month, Healey administration officials did not have an estimate of the unmet financial need of Bay Staters eligible for the proposed program.Debate about permanent tax relief featured prominently last session, and both branches approved a set of changes to the rental deduction, senior circuit breaker, child and dependent tax credit, estate tax and earned income tax credit (EITC) collectively worth more than $500 million per year.But after learning in the summer that state government owed taxpayers nearly $3 billion in rebates under a decades-old law, House and Senate Democrats put their proposal on ice and then ultimately backed away entirely.Mariano said Thursday that \"countless informative conversations\" and the annual consensus revenue process led to his decision to make another pass. At one point, he joked that House Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Revenue Committee Co-chair Rep. Mark Cusack deserved \"hazardous pay\" for wading through public input about tax relief.\"I think Chairman Cusack had about five hours of public input the other day,\" Mariano said, referencing Tuesday's Revenue Committee hearing about Healey's nearly $1 billion tax relief bill and many others.Healey's bill calls for a new $600-per-dependent tax credit for parents and caregivers, expansions to the rental deduction and senior circuit breaker credit, a threefold increase in the estate tax threshold to $3 million, and a reduction of the short-term capital gains tax rate from 12 percent to 5 percent.\"The balance is just based on the numbers. If I can get the numbers where I want them, then that's the balance,\" Mariano said. \"You gotta remember, I have to get the votes, so that's a concern. I have progressive members and I have conservative members, so it has to be something I can get passed.\"Some Democrats have also pushed to change the voter-approved tax cap law, known as Chapter 62F, that prompted last year's rebates, which were paid out in proportion to the amount each taxpayer owed during the year. Mariano said Thursday he is \"considering\" action to overhaul the measure, but hinted that it might not feature in the on-deck tax package.\"I don't know if this is the vehicle to do it, but I think that what happened \u2014 I didn't like the dispersal of the money. I think there were some equity issues involved around that that should be looked at,\" he said. \"But I think it's going to take a little bit of concentrated effort to get it right. I don't want to just do it on the fly and create new, different problems that still have some of the same issues. But it is something I'm going to take a look at.\"",

      "body": "Joseph Fisher, a former Boston Police officer, was arrested in Plymouth Thursday for allegedly entering the U.S. Capitol Building during the Jan. 6 insurrection and assaulting a Capitol Police officer. Fisher is the latest in 22 arrests by the FBI\u2019s Boston office, covering Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Maine, in connection with the Jan. 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally. Five died during or immediately after the 2021 attack, including one Capitol Police officer, and two more officers died by suicide in the days after the attack. The Capitol riots triggered the creation of a bipartisan Congressional committee to investigate the day\u2019s events, including the extent of Donald Trump\u2019s involvement, and ultimately recommended criminal charges for the former president. A visual breakdown, included in court filings submitted by FBI Special Agent Casey Biagiotti, shows Fisher\u2019s apparent movements on Jan. 6: first near the Washington Monument, then to outside the Capitol Building, entering the building and walking through multiple halls. When a group of rioters and a Capitol Police officer got into an altercation, Fisher allegedly hit the officer with a chair. In all, Fisher was allegedly in the Capitol Building for 18 minutes. Another regional FBI office directed the Boston FBI office to Fisher because he was wearing a beanie with several Boston sports logos when he entered the Capitol building, according to court filings. His phone also was later traced to the building on the day of the riots, according to the complaint. The Woke Windows Project, an online database that provides public records about the Boston Police Department, shows that four citizen complaints were made about Fisher between 2002 and 2015. The complaints were unfounded, unsubstantiated or Fisher was exhonorated in each case, the database shows. Two other Boston Police officers were dismissed earlier this month for actions related to the Jan. 6 insurrection. One officer, Joseph Abasciano, acknowledged he had been part of the crowd on Jan. 6 but did not enter the Capitol Building. Another officer, Michael Geary, when an FBI social media account put out a request for information related to the riots, replied \u201crats get bats\u201d \u2014 which he explained as a \u201csatirical jab\u201d in an internal investigation. Both were dismissed, and Abasciano told GBH News he was concerned about his First Amendment rights being violated for his dismissal. More than 1,000 people have been arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection since it took place more than two years ago.",

      "body": "The process that yielded Boston\u2019s latest voting map was both a strategy to protect incumbents and a \u201cracial diluting\u201d of the city\u2019s long-held majority-minority seat in Mattapan, At-Large City Councilor Michael Flaherty testified in federal court Tuesday.His comments came during the opening hearing of the case challenging the legality of the voting map approved by the council and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu last November.Flaherty, who is in his 20th year on the Boston City Council, argued fellow councilors who ultimately approved the map were less experienced with the redistricting process and wrongly focused on racial demographics. \u201cWe\u2019re here today because people disregarded the advice of professional experts,\u201d Flaherty proclaimed, pointing to a memo drafted by Jeffrey Wice, a redistricting expert and adjunct professor at New York Law School. The memo listed key principles for redistricting, including \u201cpopulation equality, minority voting rights, compactness, contiguity and preservation of neighborhoods.\u201d\u201c[The council\u2019s] primary objective,\u201d Flaherty argued, was \u201cpopulation balancing\u201d \u2014 which is basically making sure each district contained an equal number of voters. That goal, he testified, was largely achieved during a September working session. In that session, all councilors except one, Ricardo Arroyo, toyed with voting district boundaries according to newly drawn precincts, the units that compose the city\u2019s nine voting districts. Rather than adhering to the equal population charge, Flaherty said his council colleagues eventually disregarded the changes of that working session and erroneously considered racial demographics as they sought to rearrange the city\u2019s nearly 300 precincts according to the latest U.S. Census figures. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to do anything else,\u201d he said repeatedly.Toward the end of his three-hour testimony, Flaherty said he feels the council\u2019s \u201crushed\u201d adoption of the map created another vulnerability: it opens up the council to accusations of incumbent protection. The late adoption, he said, would make it very difficult for an aspiring City Council candidate to determine what district they reside in and take the necessary steps to challenge a sitting councilor. Those seeking to run in the upcoming election can begin declaring their intent to run as soon as April 19, a fact that dawned on Judge Patti B. Saris as Flaherty wrapped up.\"I need to have this done by the end of April?\" she asked the attorneys, noting a prior impression of no urgent deadline for the case. Flaherty\u2019s testimony was punctuated by stints of searching for exhibits and murmurs and snickering from onlookers in the audience, mostly from local political advocacy groups who support Boston\u2019s new map. At one point, Judge Saris warned the onlookers to be quiet, or be ejected from the courtroom.Lawyers for the city did not produce a witness, but in opening statements said that the case amounted to a mere political dispute.\u201cThis case is ultimately about choices,\u201d said attorney Jennifer Grace Miller. The final map, she said, made \u201cmodest\u201d changes to the city's last map, was approved through the proper municipal channels and left a contingent of residents unsatisfied.Plaintiffs challenging the city map are scheduled to present more witnesses, including veteran Congressman Stephen Lynch, whose district contains a portion of South Boston. The case is an outgrowth of a state court case brought by a coalition of South Boston residents and community groups who tried to stop the council from approving the map last year. The case was later amended to include the latest arguments, then eventually moved to federal court and revised to include new plaintiffs. Boston saw an explosion of growth in its newly built Seaport neighborhood over the last decade. The area sits within the city\u2019s second voting district, requiring the boundaries to shift and shed population. At the same time, the city\u2019s third district, anchored in Dorchester, needed to pick up voters. Councilor Arroyo, who was stripped of chairmanship of the city\u2019s redistricting committee amid last year\u2019s messy Democratic primary for Suffolk County district attorney, attended Tuesday\u2019s hearing and said his colleague\u2019s testimony illustrated \u201cjust how frivolous the lawsuit actually is.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s very telling that not a single expert is on the witness list for the plaintiffs \u2026 and I think it\u2019s pretty clear at this point that there\u2019s no real law this lawsuit is standing on,\" he said. The case is scheduled to resume Wednesday.",

      "body": "It was summer in Vermont and the sound of cicadas droned through the woods. This insect song was the inspiration Vinh Le needed to open his first restaurant space.\u201cCicada is summer,\u201d Le, the co-owner of Cicada Coffee Bar, told Boston Public Radio at the Boston Public Library on Tuesday. \u201cCicadas remind me about my childhood, about the times I relaxed.\u201d Vinh Le and his life and business partner Duong Huynh, have created a restaurant at 106 Prospect St. that doubles as a community space, where patrons can slow down, connect and share food and drinks in the heart of Cambridge. Ten years ago, Le left Vietnam for the U.S. to attend architecture school at Columbia University. During the pandemic, Le\u2019s life slowed down and he decided he wanted to open a restaurant. But not just any restaurant \u2014 he wanted every aspect of the space to be tailored to the Cambridge community. The funky lighting, the handmade plates and the mid-century modern furniture are all designed with Cambridge tastes in mind. Customers might recognize the mid-century modern chairs from their grandmother\u2019s house, Le said. Once in Cicada\u2019s cozy interior (after braving the line that often stacks up outside the restaurant), people consume locally sourced drinks and food inspired by Le\u2019s home country. Vietnamese food is defined by lots of fresh ingredients and herbs, Le said. The menu includes fresh summer rolls filled with vegetables, sushi rice with salmon and mushrooms, banh mi sandwiches and noodle salad with charred eggplant. The coffee is not to be missed. The sea salt shaker is the signature drink made with coffee, sea salt and condensed milk. All the ingredients are shaken vigorously in a cocktail shaker to create a frothy, milkshake-like beverage. \u201cThis is my performance,\u201d said Le, as he showed off his bartending skills and poured iced coffee for hosts Jim Braude and Margery Eagan.Vietnamese started using condensed milk in their coffee during the Vietnam War, said Le, when they didn\u2019t have access to fresh milk. In addition to sweet caffeine, Cicada serves hot tea brewed with fresh ginger and lemongrass, plus homemade hot sauce. Le's innovation has been recognized, it was announced in January that he is a semifinalist for the Emerging Chef James Beard Award. The short list of James Beard Award nominees will be announced Mar. 29. When asked whether the nomination puts a burden on his shoulders, Le said he wasn\u2019t bothered. He plans to continue cooking and creating community at Cicada no matter what happens. Still, he acknowledged it\u2019s still stressful owning and operating a new restaurant. But this stress leads to hard work and creativity, said Le. To balance the stress Le said he practices living in the moment, whether it is cooking food or picking up a shift for a sick coworker. BPR host Jim Braude asked Le\u2019s partner Huynh, standing just off stage, whether that is true. \u201cHe tries every other moment to live in the moment,\u201d said Huynh, with a laugh.",

      "body": "At the Massachusetts State House on Tuesday morning, community activists and members of the Massachusetts Commission on LGBTQ Youth gathered on the steps in support of trans youth. The rally came ahead of Trans Day of Visibility on March 31, which, in Washington, D.C., will culminate with the March for Queer & Trans Youth Autonomy. It will be the first major queer and trans-led demonstration in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cWe\u2019re just here to say that we deserve gathering not just on hot June parades, but also on wet March mornings,\u201d said North American Indian Center of Boston civic engagement co\u00f6rdinator Reggi Alkiewicz during their address to the crowd. It was evident that the damp chill of early spring did not temper the enthusiasm radiating from Beacon Street. Commission executive director Shaplaie Brooks emphasized the commonwealth\u2019s legacy of pioneering social initiatives and the necessity that it remain at the vanguard of progressivism: Massachusetts is the first state to have such a commission centered on the wellbeing of LGBTQ youth. But the commission is counted as but one victory, and Brooks was vocal about the need for continuous political engagement. She pointed to the nationwide statistics: 434 bills in U.S. state legislatures target LGBTQ people, according to a tracker from the ACLU. \u201cConsider this the home base for the national march that\u2019s in Washington this Friday,\u201d Brooks exclaimed during her remarks. Even if Massachusetts isn\u2019t one of the several states that has already passed explicitly anti-trans legislation, such sentiment still exists here: a group including apparent neo-Nazis interrupted a drag story hour in Taunton, and Boston Childrens\u2019 Hospital has received multiple bomb threats from harassers over the gender-affirming care the hospital provides. \u201cThanks to MassEquality, we know that in Massachusetts alone, there are 48 districts and counting that have anti-LGBTQ activity,\u201d Brooks said. Commission vice chair Noemi Uribe reiterated that the state should focus on proactive legislation to combat this antagonism: \u201cEven though we don't have legislation or filed bills right now that are anti-LGBTQ or anti-trans, that activity is still something we need to listen to, and we need to call on legislators to pass protections to prevent anything from happening.\u201d Despite the energy at the rally, the event was also an indicator of the remaining work to be done: in the crowd there was a conspicuous lack of Black youth, something that co-chair Craig Martin acknowledged. \u201cOur youth of color don\u2019t always have the spaces where they can feel brave and be public, because they are generally the ones who are most targeted, experience the most violence, and actually seem to be invisible in the very sphere of the community,\u201d he said. \u201cNot having them here means we still have a lot more work to do to create a brave space for them to come out and just be in community.\u201d A part of that work includes the commission\u2019s annual report, due April 27, that provides \u201cevidence-based and community-sourced recommendations\u201d to both the state Legislature and statewide agencies, outlining policies and programs to secure the well-being of LGBTQ youth.",

      "body": "While Attorney General Andrea Campbell works to set up a new gun law enforcement unit in her office, she\u2019s also calling on credit card companies to play a role in combating gun violence. Last week, Campbell joined 13 attorneys general from other states in sending a letter to the four major credit card companies, urging them to help \u201cdisrupt\u201d gun violence. Visa, American Express, MasterCard and Discover earlier this month announced a pause on plans to adopt a new code distinctly categorizing sales at gun stores, a feature supporters say would help flag suspicious purchases made with credit cards. The AGs\u2019 letter argues that merchant category codes are routine and that political pushback from other states should not impede the move. \u201cIf you can track us going to Walmart and buying milk, why not guns? Which gives law enforcement critical tools to not only look at where people are buying, if gun hoarding is happening, but also if someone illegally purchased a weapon and used it in some horrific crime, law enforcement can go after them and hold them accountable,\u201d Campbell said on Boston Public Radio Friday. The attorney general announced plans to create a gun safety unit at her inauguration in January. She said Friday that she\u2019s starting an internal working group and reaching out to law enforcement as she develops both the gun unit and a police accountability unit. She described the gun enforcement unit as a one-stop shop within her office for sharing best practices around issues like firearm trafficking and the manufacturing of so-called ghost guns, untraceable weapons assembled from parts that are often bought online or made with 3-D printers. \u201cWe have folks in our state police unit that are doing trainings every day with local law enforcement,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cWe need legislative solutions, as well, to keep folks from being able to manufacture these weapons in Massachusetts and sell them. In addition, this same unit can also address gun violence in the community and make sure that survivors are getting the resources they need.\u201d Campbell is not alone in eyeing legislative action on guns. Gov. Maura Healey supports legislation banning ghost guns, and House Speaker Ron Mariano has said he wants to work this session on further strengthening the state\u2019s gun laws. Next Thursday, volunteers from Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense plan to visit the State House to lobby for what they describe as comprehensive gun safety legislation. Campbell also touched on the deluge of sports-betting ads now that the industry is up and running in Massachusetts. Campbell said she doesn\u2019t plan to stand in the way of the sports-betting law passed last summer, but that her office wants to protect consumers, particularly young people. She\u2019s been in communication with the state Gaming Commission as its members develop regulations, and said she wants there to be guardrails that prevent athletes, influencers and experts from making money by recommending particular wagers. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t get paid, for example, for encouraging you to place a certain bet that will likely lose and get a percentage of those losses,\u201d Campbell said.",

      "body": "As evictions spike in Boston and across Massachusetts, state legislators are under increasing pressure to extend key COVID-era protections for tenants that are slated to expire next week. Adam Reilly is joined by Andrea Park, the director of community driven advocacy at the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, and state Representative Mike Connolly to discuss that push and the political challenges currently facing legislation that could mitigate housing insecurity. Park says the protections that are about to sunset have already helped thousands of Massachusetts residents stay in their homes, and warns that lessons learned during COVID are at risk of being forgotten as we try to put the pandemic behind us. Connolly agrees that the protections should be extended into 2024, and also says rent control \u2014 also known as rent stabilization \u2014 remains \u201cquite viable\u201d on Beacon Hill despite a notably cool reception from House Speaker Ron Mariano.Do you think state government is doing enough to protect tenants as Massachusetts emerges from COVID?

      "body": "Days after former President Donald Trump claimed he was going to be arrested over his hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels, it still hasn\u2019t happened. NBC\u2019s political director Chuck Todd says that\u2019s part of the former president\u2019s \u201cmedia savvy\u201d when it comes to legal trouble. \u201cDonald Trump manufactured a story and most people fell for it,\u201d Todd said on GBH\u2019s Boston Public Radio Thursday. \u201cAnd it [the arrest] wasn\u2019t nearly as close as everybody made it seem. It\u2019s really frustrating to watch this when you know what he\u2019s doing, you see it happening in real time.\u201d The scandal results from adult film star Daniels\u2019 plans to sell her story about a 2006 affair with Trump, a relationship that Trump and his allies have repeatedly denied. Manhattan prosecutors are investigating a potentially illegal $130,000 payment to Daniels to keep the story quiet in the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Indicting a former president would be unprecedented in the nation\u2019s history. Trump turned to social media over the weekend to tell his supporters to protest his arrest, which he said would happen Tuesday. \u201cOne thing he is is media savvy about his legal problems,\u201d Todd said, pointing to multiple criminal investigations the former president is staring down. \u201cThe entire premise of Donald Trump\u2019s existence is about escaping a legal problem. That\u2019s how he has lived his life for the last 40 years, starting with the bankruptcies.\u201dBut for Todd, the uproar over Trump\u2019s apparently imminent arrest did prove one thing. \u201cIf he is living and breathing \u2014 and running \u2014 he is going to win this nomination,\u201d Todd predicted. He pointed to Republican politicians who questioned the legitimacy of the investigation into the former president. Florida governor and likely 2024 campaign rival Ron DeSantis insulted Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over a \u201cmanufactured circus,\u201d and three House Republicans demanded that Bragg disclose documents detailing his criminal investigation. \u201cThis was a fascinating power play by Trump,\u201d Todd said. \u201cFor a man who is politically extraordinarily weak with the middle of the electorate ... it was an impressive show of influential bullying power.\u201d Who holds sway in the 2024 election is already top of mind on both sides of the aisle. Some are casting doubt on Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 political power and whether she should be on the Democratic ticket again in 2024. Looking back on the 2020 Democratic primary that catapulted Harris into the spotlight, Todd said she blemished her credibility by being inconsistent on the issues \u2014 most infamously, on Medicare for All. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know whether she was going to run as a progressive or run as a moderate. And she was struggling. She was trying to run in both lanes,\u201d Todd said. \u201cElizabeth Warren, on the other hand, knows exactly who she is,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think Elizabeth Warren\u2019s problem as a candidate was: she came across as inaccessible. ... It very much felt like she was a podium candidate, and she was a lecturer, rather than in the middle of it all.\u201d After voters elected two of the oldest-ever presidents in Trump and Biden, Todd thinks that age would be a problem for Warren if she tried to run for president in 2028, following Biden\u2019s reelection campaign in 2024. Warren would be 79 years old during the 2028 general election. \u201cIt may punish her, fairly or unfairly,\u201d the \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host said. \u201cOne thing you can count on America doing is overcorrecting on these things. If you told me in the next 10 years we elect two of our youngest presidents in the last 50 years or so, it wouldn\u2019t shock me.\u201d",

      "body": "As Elizabeth Warren launches a bid for a third term in the U.S. Senate, recent polling might seem, at first glance, to suggest that her reelection is far from guaranteed.Earlier this year, a survey by the MassINC Polling Group found Massachusetts residents sharply divided on Warren, with 41% viewing her favorably and 36% unfavorably. A similar split was evident on the question of whether Warren should run again: 43% said she should, while 36% said she shouldn\u2019t.But MassINC pollster Steve Koczela says when it comes to gauging Warren\u2019s current prospects, those results might actually paint an inordinately bleak picture. \u201cShe starts off in a pretty similar place, honestly, to where she was in 2018,\u201d Koczela said, referring to Warren\u2019s last reelection bid. \u201cHer polling, looking back at 2017, wasn\u2019t particularly sparkling, but she went on and cruised to reelection.\u201dIn the 2018 general election, Warren faced former state representative Geoff Diehl \u2014 who had triumphed in a three-way Republican primary \u2014 and beat him handily, 60% to 36%. Koczela\u2019s caveat comes with an asterisk of its own: Diehl, who\u2019d been an early supporter of Donald Trump, personified the Massachusetts Republican Party\u2019s recent turn to the right and preference for ideological purity over electability. A few years after losing to Warren, when then-Republican Gov. Charlie Baker was still weighing whether to seek a third term, Diehl announced a gubernatorial bid of his own, seemingly undeterred by his Senate loss or Baker\u2019s high statewide approval ratings. Baker didn\u2019t run again, and Diehl lost the governor\u2019s race to Maura Healey in a landslide.After a disastrous 2022 election cycle, the Mass. GOP ousted former party chair Jim Lyons and replaced him with Amy Carnevale, who has vowed to rebuild it from the ground up. But Carnevale\u2019s project is just beginning, and the Mass. GOP is still at a nadir in terms of influence and reputation. Against that backdrop, it\u2019s not clear that any electable Republican capable of going toe to toe with Warren \u2014 who made a strong run for the presidency in the 2020 cycle \u2014 will try to unseat her next year. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen quality Republican moderates run and win the governor\u2019s office in Massachusetts,\u201d said UMass Boston political scientist Erin O\u2019Brien. \u201cBut the Massachusetts Republican Party has put out people like Charlie Baker, who was that popular governor, and run people like Geoff Diehl.\u201cIn the abstract, a moderate Republican could do well in Massachusetts,\u201d O\u2019Brien added. \u201cBut it\u2019s only in the abstract, because that individual either doesn\u2019t exist or has been forced out of Massachusetts politics.\u201dIn a text message, Carnevale told GBH News that she expects the party will field a credible challenge to Warren 2024, and that \u201cat least two Republicans\u201d are currently considering a run. She declined to identify them.Warren will also be boosted, in her latest bid, by high popularity among members of her own party \u2014 which make up roughly a third of the state\u2019s voters. In MassINC\u2019s poll, which was conducted in late January and early February, 68% of Democrats viewed her favorably and 69% thought she should run again. In March, another poll, conducted by Change Research for Northwind Strategies, found that while almost as many people viewed Warren unfavorably as favorably, 30% viewed her very favorably \u2014 more than any other Massachusetts politician polled, including Baker.Those numbers suggest two things. First, in a hypothetical 2024 general election matchup, Warren would benefit from a loyal core of supporters who would organize for her, give her money and show up at the polls. And second, anyone who might entertain the prospect of a primary challenge against Warren would face a daunting challenge. The timing of Warren\u2019s announcement is also fortuitous. As bad as the crisis of confidence currently roiling the U.S. banking system is, it\u2019s likely to be a political asset for Warren as she begins campaigning again in earnest. \u201cThat\u2019s ... her bread-and-butter sort of issue,\u201d said Shannon Jenkins, a political scientist at UMass Dartmouth. \u201cThat\u2019s what she knows inside and out. She\u2019s one of the foremost experts on banking policy in the U.S. government right now.\u201dBy renewing her calls for rigorous regulation of the banking industry, Jenkins added, Warren can bolster her standing with the progressive Democrats who make up her political base while appealing to other voters, as well.\u201cNot a lot of people are pro-big banks, right?\u201d said Jenkins. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of a gut reaction from voters.\u201dDespite all these advantages, though, Warren has some weaknesses that are worth bearing in mind as the 2024 Massachusetts Senate race shapes up.Koczela notes that, when the MassINC poll was conducted earlier this year, Warren\u2019s standing was relatively weak among younger voters, many of whom hadn\u2019t yet formed an opinion of her. Within the state, she\u2019s also more popular with well-educated voters and voters who live close to Boston. In an email, Tatishe Nteta, a political scientist at UMass Amherst and the director of the UMass Poll, noted that surveys he\u2019s worked on show a \u201csteady majority\u201d of Massachusetts residents approve of Warren\u2019s performance, and that she\u2019s been a reliable champion on student-loan forgiveness, income inequality and several other progressive causes highlighted in her campaign kickoff video.But Nteta also said Warren\u2019s performance in the 2020 Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary \u2014 in which she finished third, behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders \u2014 suggests she could be vulnerable to a primary challenge from the right.\u201cSome will say that voters in Massachusetts voted strategically for a candidate that could win in a general election matchup with Trump, but some might view these results as evidence of Warren\u2019s weakness among the moderate wing of the Democratic Party and among independents in the state,\u201d Nteta wrote.",

      "body": "State Auditor Diana DiZoglio dismissed top lawmakers\u2019 claims that she lacks the authority to audit the Legislature on Monday, days after House Speaker Ron Mariano said he wouldn\u2019t comply with her probe. \u201cWe\u2019ve already started the process of conducting the audit,\u201d DiZoglio said in an interview on Boston Public Radio. \u201cWith all due respect to Speaker Mariano, he is one of 200 legislators. Other legislators are more than welcome to speak to our office. Now, they might want to not do that so publicly due to the potential fear of retaliation, but they are able to speak with us. Their staff is as well.\u201dDiZoglio, a Methuen Democrat who has served in both the state House and Senate, was elected auditor last fall after a campaign in which she pledged to audit both the Legislature and the MBTA. She announced March 7 that she\u2019d launched her review of the Legislature, a body that she called \u201ca closed-door operation.\u201d She said she wanted to identify ways state government can do better.DiZoglio\u2019s predecessor, former Auditor Suzanne Bump, said last year that she didn\u2019t believe the office had the authority to audit the Legislature. Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka appear to share that interpretation of state law.Mariano, in a letter to DiZoglio Friday, and Spilka, in a statement earlier this month, said the House and Senate have rules that require regular audits from outside firms and publicly post their financial information. They both pointed to the Massachusetts Constitution\u2019s separation of powers among the different branches of government. \u201cThat your office has the legal authority to conduct an audit of the General Court is a claim entirely without legal support or precedent, as it runs contrary to multiple, explicit provisions of the Massachusetts Constitution, and is wholly unnecessary as the public currently has full and ready access to the House\u2019s financial information,\u201d Mariano wrote.But in Monday\u2019s interview, DiZoglio made it clear she disagreed. She said that the separation of powers argument is \u201cbogus\u201d because her office audits the courts, mentioning an audit of the Supreme Judicial Court she plans to release soon. \u201cThe Legislature is unfortunately \u2014 not the entire Legislature \u2014 legislative leadership is unfortunately, yes, using that as, frankly, an excuse to not be audited,\u201d she said. \u201cI find it very disappointing.\u201dThe audit standoff comes as the House and the Senate are gearing up to write and debate their versions of next year\u2019s budget, deciding how much money to dedicate to each corner of state government \u2014 including the auditor\u2019s office. Mariano, in an interview on WCVB that aired Sunday, pointed to that dynamic as one reason he doesn\u2019t believe the audit is appropriate. \u201cI have authority over the auditor\u2019s budget, so there are inherent conflicts when you start crossing the executive branch with the legislative branch or the judicial branch, and the constitution is designed to not allow those interferences,\u201d he said. Gov. Maura Healey\u2019s budget proposal recommends funding the auditor\u2019s office and its various divisions at a total of $26.6 million for the next fiscal year, nearly $4 million more than what was in this year\u2019s budget. DiZoglio said if the Legislature decides not to \u201cadequately\u201d fund her office in retaliation for her audit, \u201cthey would be retaliating against the residents of Massachusetts who deserve to know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent.\u201d DiZoglio said she hopes her review of the Legislature will increase transparency and accountability on Beacon Hill. Massachusetts is unique among state governments because its courts, governor\u2019s office and Legislature all claim exemption from public records laws. The state\u2019s open meeting law, too, excludes the Legislature.\u201cRight now, bills are being voted on in the dark of night, committee votes are not being made public, even legislators sometimes don't have the opportunity to read bills upwards of 100 pages or more until just before the vote is being taken,\u201d DiZoglio said.",

      "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Phillip Eng, an engineer with decades of experience running public transit systems, has been named the general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, the Boston area\u2019s troubled public transit agency, Gov. Maura Healey announced Monday.Eng, the former president of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s Long Island Rail Road and one-time interim President of New York City Transit, is currently executive vice president at the engineering consultant firm The LiRo group.\u201cPhil Eng is the proven leader the MBTA needs to improve safety and reliability across the system and restore the public\u2019s trust,\u201d Healey said in a statement. \u201cHe understands that a functioning transportation system is essential to a functioning economy, and he has a track record of taking the reins of struggling public transit systems and dramatically improving service.\"The MBTA, which oversees the nation's oldest subway system as well as commuter rail, bus and ferry service, has come under intense scrutiny in recent years for a series of safety issues that led to a federal review and a series of orders to fix the problem.The Federal Transit Administration in June issued four \u201cspecial directives\u201d that required the MBTA to better staff its operations control center; improve track maintenance; address unintended and uncontrolled train movements in maintenance facilities and rail yards; and ensure that all employee training certifications are up to date.Problems included the death of a subway rider last April who was dragged along a platform when his arm got stuck in a malfunctioning subway car door. Nine people were injured in September 2021 when an escalator at a station malfunctioned, and more than two dozen people went to the hospital in July 2021 when a Green Line train rear-ended another trolley.Last July, a subway train caught fire as it was crossing a bridge north of Boston, prompting one passenger to jump into the Mystic River and others to scramble out of windows.\u201cIt\u2019s time for a new way of doing business at the MBTA,\" Eng said in a statement. \u201cAs an engineer, a transportation professional for 40 years, and a commuter myself, I\u2019m laser focused on finding innovative solutions to complex problems and approaching them with a sense of urgency that always puts the customer first.\u201dAs interim president of NYC Transit, he was integral in initiating and implementing the $836 million plan to fix aging infrastructure and improve performance. As President of the MTA Long Island Rail Road from 2018 to 2022, he turned around on-time performance and oversaw the implementation of technology that improved the accuracy of train arrival time estimates.Steve Poftak, the MBTA's previous general manager, stepped down in January just before Healey took office. Jeff Gonneville has served as interim general manager and will assist with the transition to new management.",

      "body": "Updated at 10:53 a.m. Feb. 24SeparatorWhen Larysa Atamas first arrived in Everett last year, the sounds of the flights taking off and landing at nearby Logan Airport were a terrifying reminder of the war she had just escaped in Ukraine.\u201cIt was bad the first couple of months because I\u2019d wake up and think, \u2018My God, they\u2019re bombing us,\" she said. It didn\u2019t fully sink in that she was safe until June, when she saw children in a park playing baseball, a sport she associates with the United States.\u2018\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, I'm in America!\u2019\u201dAtamas is now living in Cambridge with her husband, Vlad, and their 9-year old, Max. They are among at least 2,000 Ukrainians who have fled to Massachusetts since Russia invaded their country last February.Atamas and Max left their home in a heavily targeted manufacturing district in Eastern Ukraine a week into the war, riding a train westbound that stopped and started throughout the night with its lights out, hoping to escape detection. Cellphones were turned off to avoid being a target of Russian airstrikes, and passengers watched the countryside as bombs lit up the sky. They spent two months in refugee camps, and escaped the home of volunteers she believed to be human traffickers, all while separated from Vlad, who was mandated to remain in Ukraine under military policy. Vlad was ultimately allowed to leave to help care for his son, because Max has a seizure disorder and behavioral health problems. They flew to Mexico and crossed the U.S. border on April 18. How long Atamas\u2019 family and other Ukrainians can stay in the U.S. is an open question. They have arrived amid changing government programs, all with different rules and expiration dates.Under the federal rule that existed the day they entered the country, Atamas, her husband and son were granted humanitarian parole when they turned themselves in at the border. That means they can legally remain in the U.S. for a year, minus two days. That clock runs out on April 16.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what happens after,\u201d she said.Anastasiia Bondarenko has two years. The 29-year-old woke up the morning that was supposed to be her beauty shop grand opening and instead found bombs raining down on Kharkiv, the glass of nearby windows vibrating.She and her husband Dmytro Bondarenko \u2014 an auto mechanic \u2014 and 7-year-old son, Tymur, escaped the city by car. \u201cI took my wedding dress. I don\u2019t know why I needed it. But it was pretty important for me,\u201d she said.Locals were hiding in bunkers, so the streets were empty \u201clike an apocalypse movie,\u201d she said. They encountered a line of young Ukrainian soldiers.\u2018\u201cThey looked ridiculous. I\u2019m a mom of a boy. They were milky-skinned boys, without beards, teenagers, with huge guns. I thought, \u2018You\u2019re too young to go there. Go home to your mom.\u2019 For me it was a shock,\" she said.They spent months scurrying from town to town ahead of missile strikes. Their longest stay was six weeks at a two-room cottage without power, shared with four others.Once out of Ukraine, Anastasiia and Dymitro heard about a program the Biden Administration launched, Uniting for Ukraine, which allows U.S. citizens or green card holders to sponsor Ukrainians, and offers legal status for two years under \u201chumanitarian parole.\u201dThey were sponsored by a stranger they found on Facebook, but some of the immigrants have been able to rely on family members already in the states. For Hanna Hurina, it was her niece, Svetala Atakhanova, who lives with her husband in Watertown. For Nadia Docenko, it was her children\u2019s godfather in Newton.With a pained expression, Hurina described her orchard back home in detail. Four cherry trees; three apple; two peach. \u201cI would eat from the harvest all summer long,\u201d she said as Atakhanova interpreted.The 68-year-old from Kyiv lost her husband just before the war, then took in many Ukrainians fleeing from the eastern part of the country. She decided to leave when Russians destroyed the electrical station powering her home.Svetlana convinced her to try Uniting for Ukraine, and filled out the application, which was approved in five days. It was Hurina\u2019s first time out of Ukraine, and she got to Logan Airport on Christmas Eve.\u201cWorkers came with a wheelchair and said they will take care of me,\u201d Hernia explained. \u201cI started crying. I said, \u2018No, no, Probably it's not for me.\u2019 They said, \u2018We know you from Ukraine, what you go through and please, we will take care of you. No worries.\u201d\u2019Nadia Docenko, 53, was at work in the office of a day care center when her manager ran in telling employees the Russians had invaded. Her 31-year-old daughter and teenager were home, so she rushed into a supermarket to find food, but abandoned that because of long lines. She and her children eventually left for a family home in a small town.Refuge was brief \u2014 a nearby oil refinery was bombed. \u201cI remember seeing the flames and thinking, \u2018oh my God. There is no safe place in Ukraine,\u2019\u201d said Docenko, who suffered from panic attacks.That\u2019s when she sent her children out of the country by foot. Their godfather from Massachusetts met them in Germany, and Docenko followed so they would qualify for the Uniting for Ukraine program. They moved to Newton in August.The newly arrived Ukrainians said they\u2019ve been moved by the kindness of the people who helped them on the journey, and by Americans here. Resettlement agencies are helping the parolees, who aren\u2019t eligible for the same federal cash assistance as refugees but qualify for similar social services, like SNAP, state housing funds, and MassHealth.Refugee agencies told GBH News they estimate about two thousand Ukrainians have arrived, but it\u2019s hard to tell precisely. The state\u2019s Office of Refugees and Immigrants reported 1,170 parolees arrived as of Jan. 31, reported to them by resettlement agency affiliates. The office said this is \u201cnot a comprehensive count\u201d and only a \u201csubset\u201d of the total number. Others could be sponsored through family and not need the help of agencies, so they aren\u2019t included in that count.Through Uniting for Ukraine, U.S. citizens or green card holders can apply to sponsor people escaping the war. The program is free, but the sponsor must show proof of financial wherewithal to support their guests.Catholic Charities of Boston is helping sponsors apply for the program, and is also part of a pilot called Welcome U.S., which lets groups sponsor an individual or a family in a so-called \u201cwelcome circle.\u201d The organization served 94 Ukrainians last year, mostly through Uniting for Ukraine.\u201cThere is a financial commitment that the [sponsor] needs to agree to because, you know, we need to make sure we're not bringing folks here and they just get left on the street,\u201d said Marjean Perhot, Catholic Charities of Boston Vice President for Refugees and Immigrants Services.She said welcome circles allow multiple sponsors to share responsibility. Participants assemble a \u201cWelcome Plan\u201d to outline how they\u2019ll help people with housing, transportation, enrolling children in school, and connect the migrants to jobs. It takes longer for a circle to be approved than individuals under Uniting for Ukraine.Many parolees are settling in Western Massachusetts, where there is a strong Ukrainian community. Jewish Family Services of Western Massachusetts has helped more than 360 individuals with over $346,000 in assistance, primarily for housing.The group connects refugees to immediate needs. \u201cI\u2019m talking English as a second language, employment services, youth-focused services, individual cash assistance benefits from the Department of Transitional Assistance,\u201d said Sara Bedford, New American program director there.The organization recently got a grant from the state to connect Ukrainians to certification training to get them licensed for their professions in Massachusetts. For many migrants, housing is the biggest hurdle, given high rent costs across the state. \u201cSometimes there are situations when a family of eight comes and they have a small two-room house or apartment and they have no other choice but to stay \u2026 until they find their own housing,\u201d said Alina Dyachenko, a Ukrainian caseworker at Jewish Family Services of Western Massachusetts. In Quincy, Anastasiia Bondarenko said her family\u2019s relationship with their sponsor grew tenuous, so they moved out and stayed with an American family before hearing about the International Institute of New England, a resettlement agency.The agency helped them with enrollment to MassHealth and school, and importantly, by writing a letter of support to a landlord, and paid for three month\u2019s rent. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of different here,\u201d said Bondarenko \u201cYou need to show your income level. You need to show your work. And if you're not have this, how can you rent an apartment?\u201dLarysa Atamas and her family left Everett and are now house-sitting in Cambridge. They got connected to that opportunity through Sam Wachman through the Ukrainian Boston Facebook group after Larysa posted asking for help finding Max's anti-convulsant medication. Wachman, 22, who studied Russian and worked in health care, helped the family get the medicine. He has also helped 15 Ukrainians apply for the Uniting for Ukraine program by showing them how to fill out documents, and connecting people abroad with potential sponsors.\u201cI generally look at families with children, the elderly, disabled, the ones most vulnerable,\u201d he said. He tries to work with people who know someone in the U.S. who can guide them through rebuilding a life here.Wachman said in most situations he\u2019s seen, it\u2019s Ukrainians who are living here and want to sponsor someone but aren\u2019t citizens or green card holders that just need someone to fill in the paperwork for their families abroad.For instance, he connected Vlad to a neighbor who could sponsor his parents. A few weeks ago, they arrived to help care for Max.Wachman also launched a nonprofit called Boston Ukrainian Action Committee to help parolees, and to send humanitarian aid abroad.He said many arriving Ukrainians are struggling with education for their children. Every family he\u2019s met has a child struggling in school. Atamas\u2019 child Max, for instance, exhibited few emotions during the months of travel, but then suddenly began acting out in \u201cways they\u2019d never seen before,\u201d his mother said.Enrolled in Everett Public Schools, his toys from Ukraine were taken away due to behavioral outbursts, said Wachman, who had to go to the school on behalf of the family. When the family tried to move Max to Cambridge Public Schools, they were told they couldn't because of Everett\u2019s behavioral reports, and also that there wasn't space in the school's program. School administrators pointed to private school as the only option \u2014 which the family can\u2019t afford. For now, Max travels to Everett for school. The family believes he just needs a district that knows how to work with children traumatized by war.With Wachman\u2019s help, they found a psychologist who works with war victims, and is seeing Max, but funds are running out.Finding employment is a continued challenge for Ukrainians who have fled to the United States due to the war. They can apply for work authorization once they\u2019re here, but the wait times are unpredictable. Federal rules for Ukrainians changed in November and they\u2019re allowed to work for three months as long as they\u2019ve applied for work authorization. Employers have to agree to that arrangement though, and most don\u2019t. Dmytro Bondarenko received authorization months before Anastasiia, but struggled to find work because mechanic shops require contractors to have their own tools, he said. He finally found one where other colleagues allowed him to borrow their tools, but that hampered the shop\u2019s workflow.Bondarenko created a GoFundMe to fundraise for tools, which cost about $8,000. He\u2019s a quarter of the way to the goal, but what he\u2019s been able to buy so far has made the work situation easier. He talks about how much he misses his shop in Ukraine, but wants to \u201crun his own in the U.S.\u201dThis isn\u2019t Bondarenko\u2019s first experience rebuilding his life. He and his mother fled the Donbas region of Ukraine when war came in 2014. \u201cI understand now I need to find some safe country to start with zero a second time,\u201d he said. \u201cI think United States is nice because it's powerful country \u2014 it's a safe place.\u201dHis wife Anastasiia received her work authorization a couple weeks ago. She\u2019s over seven months pregnant, but is considering work as an interpreter helping others like herself. In the months since moving to Massachusetts, she\u2019s helped other Ukrainians navigate the complex system of health insurance, and volunteered to get children toys.Svetlana Atakhanova and her husband in Watertown help other Ukrainian parolees by offering to connect them to employers for free through their employment agency, Job Exchange. They have a few parolees living in their home, and rented out a building in their name, which they sublease to refugees.In Newton, Nadia Docenko is afraid of leaving her relatives\u2019 home because she doesn\u2019t speak English. She\u2019s been trying to teach herself from library books, and said classes are too expensive. Not speaking English has posed a barrier to finding work. She\u2019s hoping to find a job in childcare, the industry she used to work in.In Cambridge, Atamas\u2019 husband commutes to work with his friend in construction. She found a job at a local Whole Foods whose manager goes out of her way to hire Ukrainian and Afghan parolees.But what happens when her parole expires in April?Jewish Family Services of Western Massachusetts has 28 clients who fall in the same category as Atamas, and could have benefits expire. Until Congress or the Biden administration make a move, how to help these individuals is up in the air.\u201cThey would either have to leave the U.S.; reapply for Uniting for Ukraine, which is a huge waste of resources; apply for asylum, which is a huge waste of resources; or remain relatively undocumented,\u201d said Bedford. Some families might not want to apply for asylum because they do eventually want to return to Ukraine, and wouldn\u2019t have strong asylum claims.If an individual applies for asylum, then decides to drop out of the process, their case is sent to immigration court for deportation proceedings, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association of New England.Congressman Seth Moulton was among a bipartisan group of House lawmakers who traveled to Ukraine in December. \u201cWe stand ready to do whatever is needed to continue helping these refugees if any of these cliffs do come up,\u201d he said. Moulton said there\u2019s a bipartisan \u201cappetite to make sure we continue supporting Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees.\u201dThe war has no end in sight. Through a multitude of pathways, the United States welcomed more than 253,500 Ukrainians between last March and the end of January 2023, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Most parolees expressed ambivalence over whether or not they want to return. In Watertown, Hanna Hurina said she wants to stay just until spring, but her family is urging her to stay longer to address her heart condition, and avoid doctor shortages in Ukraine.\u201cI pray every day, every night the war will be ending,\u201d said Hurina. \u201cUkraine will win, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if all our homes are destroyed.\u201dDocenko in Newton wants to return, but said she came here \u201cfor a future life for my kids.\u201dAtamas feels guilty for leaving Ukraine, but says she can\u2019t go back. \u201cThe war may go on for many years. No one can know, and no one can predict. For many decades, Ukraine will be in squalor,\u201d she said.SeparatorThis story was updated to clarify the details of Bondarenko's fundraising effort.",

      "body": "The death of 20-year-old Sayed Faisal, who was shot by Cambridge police in early January during what appears to have been a mental health crisis, has sparked a discussion about alternatives to sending armed police to respond to mental health calls. It's a conversation that's been underway in Cambridge and other Massachusetts cities for years before this fatal incident. GBH News Reporter Craig LeMoult spoke with GBH\u2019s All Things Considered host Arun Rath about these ongoing conversations. What follows is a lightly edited transcript. Arun Rath: In a statement last week, the Cambridge city manager pledged that Cambridge will use alternative responses outside of the police department for some emergency calls. What kind of alternative responses is Cambridge looking at? Craig LeMoult: Yeah, what happened is after the murder of George Floyd, Cambridge City Council created a task force to examine what they call the future of public safety. And that task force made its recommendations in May of 2021. They included the creation of a new community safety department, which was outside of police. It'll be made up of peer counselors and mental health professionals who would respond to some nonviolent calls that are currently handled by police. The city allocated $3 million for that department, but I heard its creation was slowed down by a challenging time finding somebody to head it up. Last month, the city named an interim director of the department, and she told me they're planning to have responders from this new department going out on 911 calls in this coming fall of this year. There's also this community group that's growing called Cambridge H.E.A.R.T. And H.E.A.R.T. is an acronym for Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team. They've been getting training from members of the community to be responders for mental health calls, and they're trying to get a contract with the city to respond to mental health calls. I spoke with Stephanie Guirand of Cambridge H.E.A.R.T. She couldn't comment directly on the case of Sayed Faisal, the 20-year-old who was shot by Cambridge police last month because she said she wasn't familiar enough with the details. But she did say this. Stephanie Guirand, pre-recorded: If there was a history of crises, then we would want to do regular check-ins with the family and create a care plan and develop trust with everyone in the family so that, in a moment of crisis, the person in crisis would be seeing familiar faces \u2014 which would automatically de-escalate the situation. LeMoult: So she said a key element of their plan is to work with people to prevent crises from happening to begin with. I also talked with Cambridge City Councilor Marc McGovern. He's actually a clinical social worker and he was the co-chair of that city task force that made the recommendations. He said, even if they had the new department in place and if they had a partnership with Cambridge H.E.A.R.T., there almost certainly would have been a police response in the case of Sayed Faisal, because he had a knife. But he said, hopefully, there would have also been a mental health professional that responded. Marc McGovern, pre-recorded: And then you hope that the mental health professional can take the lead and de-escalate the situation in such a way that the police aren't needed. But I don't know of any program that doesn't respond with the police if there is a weapon involved. Rath: Craig, as you mentioned, it's not just Cambridge. City officials in Boston also have been trying to figure out how to change response to mental health calls, right? LeMoult: Yeah, And in a lot of ways, they're further along with this. I spoke with Boston Police Superintendent Lanita Cullinane, who's the chief of the Bureau of Field Services, and she said the BPD has a mental health clinician in each precinct \u2014 or at least they're supposed to, they're currently looking to hire a few. It's interesting, those clinicians come from outside the police department. They're actually from Boston Medical Center. The team is called BEST, which is another acronym. It stands for Boston Emergency Services Team. And they've been doing this for years. Here's Superintendent Cullinane. Lanita Cullinane, pre-recorded: The clinicians, while they do respond to calls, they also follow up and offer additional services after they respond to calls \u2014 or even on calls that they haven't responded to, they will reach out to individuals to offer services. LeMoult: She noted, in cases where a weapon is present, that clinicians do stay back. But she said, they're still involved. One other thing: the police cars that have these mental health clinicians are not reserved just for calls with a mental health component. They can get dispatched to other calls and potentially be unavailable if a call comes in. Superintendent Cullinane said they can pull from one of the other districts if necessary.But in August of 2021, when Kim Janey was acting mayor of Boston, she announced a plan to expand the program by changing that. Kim Janey, pre-recorded: The pilot initiative will dedicate core response cars to calls likely to have a mental health concern so that we are making these mental health teams available for the calls that would benefit from their presence the most. LeMoult: That was a year and a half ago and that pilot never happened. Those cars still are not reserved just for mental health calls. Rath: It's already the case that not just police can respond to mental health calls, right? Don't EMS sometimes show up a lot of the time when, say, there's a 911 call about someone having a mental health emergency?LeMoult: That's right. In fact, unless there's a criminal action involved, mental health 911 calls in Boston go to EMS. And Boston EMS is also piloting some new approaches to these kind of calls. First of all, there's a pilot underway now where someone who calls 911 experiencing a mental health issue could have the opportunity to be connected by phone to a mental health clinician from that so-called BEST team from Boston Medical Center. I spoke with Dr. Sophia Dyer, who's the medical director for Boston EMS. Sophia Dyer, pre-recorded: And then they work with the mental health clinician that they're speaking to about what the best next step is. And sometimes that next step is, they do need an ambulance and do need to go to the emergency department. Sometimes that step is other resources, other follow-up. LeMoult: As I said, that's just a pilot, and it's not available all day right now \u2014 those clinicians are currently available for about 8 hours a day. But Dyer told me about another pilot that Boston EMS plans to launch in the late spring of this year that would pair Boston EMTs with those mental health clinicians when they go out and respond to mental health calls. That's one of the things that Acting Mayor Kim Janey announced a year and a half ago. It's actually getting started in this spring with two response vehicles. Rath: It sounds them like co-response programs for mental health calls are starting to gain some traction. LeMoult: Yeah, you know, I spoke more broadly about these kinds of programs with Melissa Morabito. She's an associate professor at UMass Lowell School of Criminology and Justice Studies, and she studies these kind of programs. And she said Massachusetts has been at the forefront of the co-response movement. She said it was significant the Boston PD had made this part of their operating budget. It initially just been grant funded. You know, there's a program in Framingham that our GBH colleague Marilyn Schairer did a story about last year, and Morabito said Lowell is just starting a program. And she pointed out, as we've been talking about here, that there are a lot of different kinds of alternatives to just sending police to respond to a mental health call. Melissa Morabito, pre-recorded: I think that there's lots of places to kind of chip away at the margins and reduce the police footprint, but I don't think it's a quick decision. It's a slow process, and I think that there are lots of different alternative responses. I don't know that you can have one alternative response that's going to do all the things. LeMoult: And she really emphasized there needs to be more focus on increasing access to mental health care in the state so it doesn't get to a point of crisis. And, you know, Massachusetts is taking steps in that direction. I mean, just yesterday, you and I talked about the new 25 community behavioral health centers that opened around the state, although those are mostly just available now for people on the state's Medicaid system.So certainly it could be argued the state is making some progress in this regard, but there's still clearly a ways to go.

      "body": "Updated March 15 at 4:13 p.m.State officials agreed Wednesday to move forward with an $85 million project to make safety repairs to the Allston I-90 viaduct, despite local opposition that further highway investments might delay eventual plans to replace the traffic-heavy bridge.The repairs will target places where the aging bridge near Boston University has structurally deteriorated, replacing its existing concrete overlay, broken and corroding deck joints, and some of the bridge's barrier railings. The Mass. Department of Transportation feels it is important to begin making these \"critical\" improvements as soon as possible, said MassDOT civil engineer Michael O'Dowd.\"Based upon the ongoing investigations and inspections that we've been doing out there, we feel it is in the best interest of the agency to move forward with this interim repair contract to identify, not only identify, but to address, more importantly, to address and repair some of the steel deterioration we've seen out there. In some instances it's critical,\" O'Dowd said at a MassDOT board meeting on Wednesday.The board voted 7-1 in favor of the project, with Tim King voting against the contract to move forward with the repairs.King voted in opposition after local advocates spoke during the meeting's public comment period that there had not been enough communication with Allston stakeholders. Members of the public added that it didn't make sense to repair the viaduct the state is preparing to remove, and worried that investing in the bridge would cause delays to its eventual removal and replacement with a more transit- and walking-friendly area.\"Honestly, no one really understands what MassDOT is doing with this repair project, and why you're seeking to spend $100 million to repair a viaduct you're also planning on tearing down in just a few years,\" said Allston resident Harry Madison, a member of the I-90 Allston Task Force.The contract granted to J.F. White Contracting is for $71.6 million, though the total project cost with added funding for contingencies, traffic police and other services, is closer to $85.7 million.The engineers would begin with work underneath the bridge structure until April 2024, to avoid traffic disruptions along I-90. The total construction is estimated to take a little over three and a half years, with work directly on the highway and on the MBTA Commuter Rail performed during nighttime/off peak hours.The city of Boston and the state have long aimed to replace the aging highway bridge with two ground-level highways, to align rail tracks and build an MBTA/commuter rail station that would serve as a transit gateway to metro west, and to add a pedestrian boardwalk at roughly the same elevation next to the Charles River. It's been over a decade since discussions on the project started, and estimates of a nearly $2 billion cost would rely in large part on federal funding.The city and state jointly applied last fall for $1.19 billion in federal funding for the Allston Multimodal Project through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but were unsuccessful. A MassDOT spokesperson said the department intends to pursue other grants.The MassDOT website for the multimodal redevelopment of the area includes an outdated timeline that says construction to replace the viaduct with the ground-level highways, rail and walkway will begin in the fourth quarter of 2023 or early 2024, and last six to 10 years. King said on Wednesday that the board has talked before about a 2045 completion date for the multimodal project. With repairs to the bridge now approved that will likely go into 2026, he said he understands local advocates' concerns about further delay.\"Today's proposal to fortify obsolete infrastructure will further delay the viaduct removal and is not a wise use of our public funds. For more than 60 years the viaduct has divided Allston's neighbors, separated us from the river and brought us the often untold damage of pollution, noise, and urban decay. And as this section of the Turnpike is approaching the end of its life, we ask that the DOT not shore up mistakes of the past,\" Glane Mook, executive director of MassBike and member of the Allston I-90 Task Force, said during public comment.The contract approved on Wednesday allows MassDOT to make changes to the scope of the work at any time, highway administrator Jonathan Gulliver said.The highway department is currently reviewing proposals sent by stakeholder engineering groups that draft an alternative construction schedule and plan, which may allow for earlier removal of the Allston viaduct, Gulliver said. The department received these proposals a few weeks ago, he said, and plans to provide an update to the board at its May meeting about possible contract changes that would allow them to make necessary repairs while not delaying future redevelopment.Though King encouraged the board to wait to approve the contract until these news plans could be considered by the department and board, O'Dowd said there was not time to wait until May and lose a few months of Boston's construction season on such critical safety repairs.\"This is, as you've heard, a preservation project. And I just want to be very clear, when we say preservation, that is an industry term to describe these types of projects,\" Gulliver said. \"When we say preservation in this case, it should not be thought of as preserving the viaduct indefinitely, that is not the intent. What it should be thought of is we are preserving the safe, structural capacity of the viaduct so that it can get to that next stage where it can do that large multimodal project.\"This story was updated with an expanded writeup from State House News Service.",

      "body": "In 2016, Matthew Tottenham, was transported in chains from his cell at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center to the state\u2019s Lemuel Shattuck Hospital for foot surgery \u2014 performed by orthopedic surgeon Adriana Carrillo.Tottenham \u2014 now 35 years old \u2014 says he\u2019d been told by his surgeon that he was going to have a simple procedure to remove bone spurs. But while he was under anesthesia, he says she did a second procedure on his foot that he did not learn about until months later. He says he woke up in mind-numbing pain and was sent back to prison in a wheelchair. For months, he says, his foot was infected, swollen and burning with pain. He begged prison officials, and Carrillo, for additional care, he says, and even clean bandages, but was rebuffed. Two months later, he required an emergency surgery to quell the infection.Now Tottenham, recently released from prison, says he\u2019s never fully recovered, walks to avoid weight on his foot and still suffers from chronic pain. \u201cShe assaulted me and then treated me as if I was nothing,\u201d Tottenham told GBH News in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be able to operate on prisoners.\u201dFor several years, Tottenham has been trying to hold Carrillo accountable for what he calls medical negligence. He is one of at least 20 people \u2014 most, if not all, current and former prisoners \u2014 who have filed lawsuits against her in state and federal courts over the last 15 years, an investigation by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting has found. Plaintiffs have alleged medical malpractice, botched surgeries \u2014 some done without their consent \u2014 as well as denial of adequate post-operative care and indifference. In interviews and court records, former patients say that in the wake of their treatment, their hands shake, they walk with a permanent limp or are in chronic pain because of what they describe as failed procedures or lack of follow-up. Carrillo couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Her attorney John Cassidy told GBH News that a doctor should not be judged on the number of lawsuits they\u2019ve received, especially when filed by prisoners, most of them without attorneys. He said the legal actions are without merit and she\u2019s never lost a case. He said she can\u2019t be responsible for what happens when incarcerated patients return to their prison cells. \u201cDr. Carrillo really should be praised and not criticized,\u201d he told GBH News on Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019s a careful, thoughtful surgeon. She\u2019s doing work that most surgeons are unwilling to do, at least in part because prisoners are notoriously litigious.\u201dMost lawsuits have been dismissed before getting to a jury, when prisoners were unable to prove their allegations, often lacking medical experts and lawyers to represent them. A handful, like Tottenham\u2019s, are still winding their way through the court system. But prisoners, their advocates and even some former Shattuck health practitioners say the complaints point to not only a rogue doctor but also a struggling public health system. In its care are some of the state\u2019s poorest patients, including prisoners, people experiencing homelessness and people with mental illnesses. Many argue prisoners \u2014 with few resources, often trying to pursue their legal fights from inside their prison cells \u2014 face an uphill battle to hold a doctor accountable. And, generally, prisons offer little choice about where prisoners receive medical care. Most often, those who need care outside their facility are treated at the Shattuck \u2014 a place that some former staff say was so poorly managed that they were unable to provide adequate care. They say, too, that the systems built to keep the hospital in check \u2014 a state board, state health officials and, more broadly, the justice system \u2014 fail to protect the vulnerable population. Elizabeth Matos, executive director of the nonprofit Prisoners\u2019 Legal Services, says her staff has been so concerned about Carrillo\u2019s treatment of patients that they maintain a spreadsheet of complaints, worry about a call from the next alleged victim, and have repeatedly reached out to prison officials and health care providers about their concerns.\u201cShe stands out in pretty serious botched surgeries that made people permanently disabled,\u201d Matos told GBH News. \u201cThis is, of course, something that should have been addressed by the department and by the health care provider already. It\u2019s not something that wasn\u2019t known to the system.\u201d Reporters from the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting worked with student journalists at Boston University for months to examine allegations of wrongdoing at the Shattuck, poring through court records and state medical complaints as well as interviewing former and current prisoners and concerned medical staff, many of whom have left the hospital. Dr. Catharina Armstrong, a former Shattuck employee, told GBH News that Carrillo is not only a \u201cdangerous surgeon\u201d but lacks compassion and treats prisoners with disdain. Armstrong says she reported her concerns to management years ago but nothing was done. She resigned in 2019 from her post as chief of infectious diseases amid wider concerns about care and staffing at the hospital. Armstrong says she\u2019s appalled Carrillo is still working there.\u201cIt\u2019s a travesty in medical care,\u201d Armstrong said during a recent interview with other concerned former Shattuck doctors. \u201c[Many patients] had more deficits than when they went into the operation. And they were never rectified. And many patients would refuse to ever be seen by her again.\u201dOfficials from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health say that there\u2019s been \u201cno formal patient complaints filed with the Shattuck\u201d related to Carrillo. The lawsuits against her are not surprising, officials said in a written response to GBH News. \u201cYou would expect Dr. Carrillo to have greater exposure to malpractice claims based simply on the number of orthopedic procedures performed as orthopedic procedures generally have a higher rate for malpractice claims,\" according to a written statement released by the department.Officials say Massachusetts \u201chas made significant improvements\u201d at all four state hospitals since 2020.\u201cShattuck has also strengthened oversight and accountability and bolstered its internal communications process to improve clinical decision-making,\u201d the spokesperson said in a written statement. \u201cThe hospital is deeply committed to treating every patient with dignity and respect. This includes recognizing that every patient has a right to decline our care, if they so choose.\u201dPrisoners are allowed to refuse treatment unless the situation is \u201clife threatening\u201d and requires the state to seek \u201ca court order for forced treatment,\u201d according to state policy records.Complaints about Carrillo\u2019s care, specifically, and the Shattuck in general are numerous, inside and outside the courtroom. Several prisoners described to GBH News what they claimed was negligent care, but said they didn\u2019t file suit because they didn\u2019t know how. Others \u2014 like Tottenham \u2014 have filed legal motions simply for the right to receive care at a different hospital.SeparatorHave a tip or a comment about care at the Shattuck hospital? Reach out to GBH Deputy Investigative Editor Jenifer McKim at jenifer_mckim@wgbh.org.SeparatorCurrent lawsuits include one by Epiphany Lazarre who is suing Carrillo in federal court, claiming that she administered steroid injections into his lower back in 2017 that left him essentially \u201cparalyzed.\u201d Lazarre arrived at the hospital with back pain and went back to prison in a wheelchair, court records show. He claims she failed to follow up, acting \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to his needs. A judge in 2020 denied a request by Carrillo to dismiss the claim, finding Lazarre \u201chad plausibly alleged\u201d his claim of indifference and awarded him pro bono legal representation. The case is pending.In addition to court filings, Carrillo has been the subject of at least eight complaints filed with the state Board of Registration in Medicine since 2003, according to records obtained by GBH News through several public record requests. Some of these complaints replicated those in court suits. Some prisoners, like Tottenham, also filed complaints with the state board before filing a lawsuit. Similar to other cases, the board sought a response from Carrillo and then decided not to impose any punishment, instead leaving the complaint in the doctor\u2019s file.Tottenham first reached out to GBH News in a handwritten letter from prison, saying that the judges, board and hospital \u201ccover for her always.\u201d \u201cI have found out how crooked this system is, in favor of doctors who do unspeakable things and walk [scot-free] to continue to do it over and over,\u201d he wrote.State law requires the board to publish any reports of a malpractice payment online. Carrillo paid out one medical malpractice claim last year, according to her publicly available state profile. State officials say it was for $45,000 but declined to provide any more information. Cassidy, Carrillo\u2019s attorney, couldn\u2019t confirm the payout amount but said his client voluntarily paid out the claim after she cut into the wrong ankle of a patient and left a scar. \u201cThe surgery was started on the wrong ankle, a skin incision was made, it was recognized immediately,\u201d he said. Court records show Carrillo settled a second medical malpractice claim in 2013 in Springfield. But the state\u2019s online profile of Carrillo does not mention that case and officials told GBH News they had no information the settlement came with a payout.Andrew Meyer, a leading Boston medical malpractice attorney, says the state board has long been \u201cinept\u201d in living up to its mission to police doctors. The seven-member board, including five physicians, \u201cwas created in 1894 to protect the public health safety by setting standards for the practice of medicine,\u201d according to its website. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the funding, nor do they have the will or the desire to investigate these kind of claims,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIn reality, the board of registration is a protection racket for doctors.\u201dState officials say the board maintains a \u201crobust\u201d public page with profiles of physicians, including malpractice claims against them, investigates all complaints and imposes discipline when necessary. The state has received 2,861 complaints between 2016 and 2020 and disciplined 261 physicians, officials say, with a range of punishments including reprimands, revocations and suspensions. \u201cPatient safety is of utmost importance to the Board of Registration in Medicine,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Public Health said in a written statement. The board \u201cfully investigates all complaints against physicians submitted by patients, family members, healthcare facilities and other healthcare providers and takes action as warranted to protect patients.\u201dMeyer says the number of lawsuits filed against Carrillo is cause for concern. He says for every person who files a complaint, there\u2019s likely 20 more that didn\u2019t feel empowered enough to state a claim. He compares it to red flags prompted by a driver with speeding tickets.\u201cIf you get stopped speeding once, it\u2019s maybe a mistake; two, three times, you\u2019re probably on the edge,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have seven or eight speeding tickets, you\u2019re probably speeding a lot and you probably have been violating the law.\u201dBut winning medical malpractice suits is notoriously difficult, even for people outside the prison system. To succeed, a plaintiff must prove that a physician\u2019s actions were negligent and that negligence caused personal injuries. Those cases require expensive medical experts to support the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.To win a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d claim in federal court, a prisoner needs to prove that a doctor\u2019s care was so \u201cclearly inadequate as to amount to a refusal to provide essential care at all,\u201d as a judge laid out last year when she dismissed one of the complaints against Carrillo. Meyer says the vast majority of cases that go to trial are won by doctors \u2014 and people without an attorney have little chance of success. \u201cThey are expensive, and they are difficult to bring,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why very few people even do it.\u201dCarrillo is seen as a \u201cworkhorse\u201d at the Shattuck, carrying out at least 10 or more procedures a week, according to Kathryn Noonan, a former Shattuck employee who served as director of information technology until last year. Noonan said she\u2019s not surprised by the number of lawsuits \u2014 which average just over one a year \u2014 particularly because of the number of procedures Carrillo performs. \u201cMost people sort of admired her work ethic, she saw a lot of patients,\u201d Noonan said. \u201cShe was very, very prolific.\u201d Carrillo graduated from the University of Javeriana Faculty of Medicine in Colombia in 1987, according to a state physician lookup site. There, she completed a residency in orthopedic surgery, completed in 1994, and then a second residency in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Boston Medical Center. She is not board certified as an orthopedic surgeon. Her attorney says that\u2019s because she did her training outside of the country. Certification is not required by law, but most major Boston hospitals told GBH News that they don\u2019t allow surgeons to work without it following several years of hire. Carrillo is not directly employed by the state but works for the Shattuck through an independent company called Orthopedic Trauma, P.C. She\u2019s also affiliated with the Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Milton through the same company. But a Beth Israel spokesperson says Carrillo is not qualified to practice at the hospital because of her lack of certification. Carrillo\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly defended her work in lawsuits as complying with the \u201cstandard of care\u201d required by physicians. Among those who lost their legal cases against her, state prisoner Treas Carter filed suit in 2011 claiming Carrillo \u201cfailed\u201d a hip surgery that left him with one leg two inches shorter than the other. Carter claims that he was permanently disabled and struggles with chronic pain. His case was dismissed after a judge denied his request for a pro bono attorney and he was unable to produce an expert witness to support his claim. \u201cNo attorney wants to take on a medical malpractice against a [Department of Correction] medical provider,\u201d Carter told GBH News in an email from prison earlier this month, saying the department\u2019s legal team is too well resourced and can drag out court cases. \u201cDr. Carrillo should be removed.\u201dThere\u2019s also state prisoner Joseph DeLong, who claims that Carrillo left metal in his knee during a 2016 surgery and then attempted to cover it up. DeLong \u2014 a stocky, muscular man who has spent most of his life in prison \u2014 says he exited surgery feeling much worse than when he went in, like a knife stabbing him at the spot he had been operated on. After months of complaints, Carrillo took X-rays and recommended that he get a full knee replacement. But when DeLong read his report, he realized the doctor had failed to give him a key piece of information: Carrillo had left metal fragments in his leg. A federal court judge found there was enough merit to DeLong\u2019s story to approve a pro bono attorney. The judge also awarded him money to hire an expert to better understand what happened to him.But the review wasn\u2019t what DeLong hoped for.The expert hired to examine the case reported in a letter to the attorney that Carrillo deviated from the standard of care by \u201cnot recognizing that a drill bit approximately 1.4 cm in length had broken off during the procedure.\u201d He also said that Carrillo erred when she \u201cfailed to observe, note and inform the patient of, or ignored, the presence of the foreign body on X-ray.\u201dHowever, the expert also concluded that the half-inch long piece of metal \u201cembedded in bone,\u201d was not the source of DeLong\u2019s suffering. DeLong disagrees. He maintains the excruciating pain in his knee occurred after the surgery. \u201cShe\u2019s a butcher, and she needs to be held to account,\u201d he said.In late February, a three-judge panel in the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court\u2019s decision to dismiss the case.DeLong wrote in an email from prison that he was disappointed by the decision. \u201cI tried to the best of my ability to have them held accountable for their wrongful conduct,\u201d he said. DeLong was so upset about his care at the Shattuck that he filed a legal motion to force the state to allow him to have a follow-up surgery on his knee at a private hospital.Advocates say it\u2019s next to impossible to get treatment elsewhere. DeLong says in his case, a sympathetic prison administrator helped him arrange for a full knee replacement at a different hospital \u2014 treatment he felt was like night and day.At the Shattuck, he said, \u201cthey treat you so inhumane that you literally feel like you\u2019re not a human being.\u201d The facility with roughly 250 beds is run by the state Department of Public Health in conjunction with the Department of Mental Health and the Department of Correction.Doctors who work there describe a sense of mission in caring for some of the poorest and most troubled patients in the state. But a group of former staff members \u2014 including Armstrong \u2014 say they left several years ago, deeply concerned about treatment of patients and worried about retribution from administrative leadership if they spoke up.\u201cI do believe there is a feeling of bullying and retaliation if you do speak up for things that would make the hospital look bad or the administration look bad,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cAnd many people didn\u2019t speak up.\u201d Armstrong and two other former Shattuck physicians spoke with GBH News in early March in the hopes of shining a light on the facility, one that they all dedicated many years of their lives to. They said they did speak up \u2014 but felt they weren\u2019t heard. In 2019, after Armstrong left, a group of employees sent a letter to Monica Bharel, then-commissioner of the Department of Public Health, detailing complaints including \u201cunsafe staffing\u201d and a \u201cpunitive\u201d work environment. \u201cThis is a plea from the majority of Shattuck Hospital staff for a reexamination of the hostile and toxic work environment,\u201d the letter said.The department met with staff, but doctors who spoke with GBH News say nothing changed. Medical personnel sent a follow-up letter in 2020 saying things had only gotten worse. \u201cWe believe that things have deteriorated significantly since our initial communication with the public health mission at Shattuck Hospital even more at risk than it was six months ago,\u201d they wrote. Many staff members eventually left.Later that year, then-Chief Executive Officer Joel Skolnick resigned. While some say he resigned under pressure, Skolnick told GBH News he left on his own accord. He defended his leadership and said many of the medical personnel who departed were not sufficiently dedicated to the hospital\u2019s mission. \u201cThe physicians, even though some of them were very good, weren\u2019t showing up, they weren\u2019t writing in the patient records,\u201d Skolnick said.State officials say the physician complaints were investigated and \u201cresolved.\u201d They also noted that another group of doctors sent a 2019 letter in support of new leadership. But Dr. Salah Alrakawi, who headed the residency program at the Shattuck before leaving in 2020 after 23 years in the system, is dubious that improvements were made. \u201cWe completely lost trust in the system, that there\u2019s any transparency in the system and there\u2019s any real investigation or holding people accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was really no action that shows that someone is taking our complaint seriously.\u201d Dr. Jack Cadigan, who left his post as chief of cardiology in 2020, says he\u2019s proud of his work at the Shattuck but left because the environment became too difficult to continue. \u201cSome of the finest doctors I know left the facility \u2014 and they could work anywhere.\u201d They also said there are many health practitioners still there who need support. \u201cWhy is Dr. Carrillo continuing to operate when she is causing such damage?\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cWhy is there not more oversight with the needs of the hospital? Why? Why are we not being heard?\u201dComplaints from prisoners focus on the hospital\u2019s correctional unit located on the Shattuck\u2019s eighth floor. It\u2019s a medium security unit operated in conjunction with the Department of Correction, at an annual cost per person of about $436,000, according to a recently released state report. About 17 people generally are treated there each day.Tottenham didn\u2019t sue only Carrillo. Like many plaintiffs, he names a list of defendants, including prison staff and medical personnel. But he told GBH News that it was his treatment by Carrillo that prompted him to file suit, writing out his claim by hand from his prison cell. The tall, tattoo-covered man says it wasn\u2019t until two months after his surgery that he learned Carrillo had performed a second procedure on his foot \u2014 a bunionectomy \u2014 that he hadn\u2019t approved or been aware of. He says he also read in his medical records that Carrillo claimed he later had mishandled his bandages, which may have contributed to his poor recovery.\u201cI felt betrayed when I got my medical records,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not going to treat me like a dog and then blame me.\u201dCarrillo says in court records that when he signed his consent forms, he understood \u201cthat conditions may develop during the procedure which would require modifying or extending\u201d the scope of the surgery. She says she performed the surgeries \u201cconsistent with the standard of care applicable to the average qualified orthopedic surgeon in 2016.\u201dIn 2018, a three-member Medical Malpractice Tribunal ruled in Tottenham\u2019s favor, a key step to a case moving forward. But in June, a Suffolk Superior Court Judge dismissed his case, claiming he hadn\u2019t been able to prove his claims with the help of an expert witness or had taken a deposition of Carrillo.Tottenham says he wasn\u2019t able to access X-rays of his foot or arrange a deposition of Carrillo from his prison cell. He is preparing his appeal from his temporary housing in a motel room in Connecticut, set up with a new printer and a computer gifted by a family member. He\u2019s hoping a new judge will support efforts to get him a pro bono attorney and funds to hire an expert.\u201cI went to prison. I didn\u2019t sign up for torture,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave them consent to do the surgery that she explained, and she did another surgery which resulted in the altering of my entire life.\u201dResearch for this story was launched in a Boston University College of Communication investigative journalism class.
