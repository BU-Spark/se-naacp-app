A cross country runner, he trained hard all summer in hopes a season would happen.And, to his surprise, it did. But it wasn't without restrictions.\u201cThe state \u2026 didn\u2019t really know what was safe or not safe. So everything kept getting pushed back,\" said White's coach, Chris Blondin. \"And we were just praying that it wouldn\u2019t end up like the spring season where it outright got cancelled. So the fact that we even have a season at all is just a blessing.\u201dBut then, in the last week of October, Boston Public Schools postponed the few athletic activities it was allowing, essentially killing the BLS season. It's just one example of the dark hole that high school sports have been thrown into during the pandemic. And even for the sports and districts that are still going, a season can seem like a countdown to the inevitable postponement or cancellation. And for White, and other high school seniors like him, that uncertainty about what happens next may be the common refrain as they attempt to navigate through the haze of COVID-19.More from COVID And The ClassroomFor the full story, click on the audio player button above.

      "body": "A wave of blue votes could wash over the Massachusetts State House's small Republican caucus this election, but local political experts say that voters may be more than willing to keep conservatives on Beacon Hill even if most Bay Staters want to reject President Trump.Tuesday's election is expected to draw as many as 3.5 million Massachusetts ballots through the mail and in person, energized by Massachusetts voters' zeal to replace Trump, who lost to Hillary Clinton here 61 percent to 33 percent in 2016.Georgetown Republican Rep. Lenny Mirra knows what he's up against as he runs for a fourth term and that \"there are a lot of people that won't vote for Republicans because of Donald Trump.\"\"Even though a state legislator has nothing to do with the president, there are people that will say, no, you're on the 'red team' and Donald Trump is on the 'red team', therefore I'm not voting for you,\" Mirra told GBH News. \"There are people like that. There's a lot of people like that,\" he said.Stonehill College political scientist Peter Ubertaccio said the national political mood is not always a good barometer of what's happening at the local level and that Republicans that focus on the district and not the White House can survive Democratic challenges even when the winds are blowing against the GOP.\"Voters will make a distinction between a presidential candidate or president they don't like,\" Ubertaccio said, \"The work of a state legislator is so different than the way in which a president is perceived in a locality that they can, in fact, overcome.\"Trump will likely lose to Joe Biden throughout Massachusetts, but areas like Worcester and Barnstable County could show slimmer Democratic victory margins than the deepest blue precincts of the Commonwealth. On the Cape this year, Republicans are defending three contiguous seats from the bridges to Brewster that Democrats think they can pick up.Republican Rep. Randy Hunt's retirement from the Fifth Barnstable district leaves retired Yarmouth deputy police chief and Republican candidate Steven Xiarhos running to replace him on Beacon Hill against Democratic opponent Jim Dever, an attorney and Sandwich school committee member.Xiarhos has tied himself closer to President Trump than most Massachusetts Republicans, close enough in fact to have to quarantine after attending a White House function and possible COVID-19 outbreak in September.Ubertaccio thinks Xiarhos will have a harder time retaining Hunt's GOP seat as a newcomer than Rep. Will Crocker will have defending his Hyannis-based seat against Democrat Kip Diggs.\"There's an excellent chance that the Republicans keep the seat in Hyannis. But there's an equally good chance that they may lose it in Sandwich simply because they don't have an incumbent running for reelection and the calculation is very different in voters' minds,\" Ubertaccio said.Former Massachusetts Senate Minority Leader, and veteran of congressional and statewide campaigns, Richard Tisei agrees that any Republican \"sitting back and resting on your laurels\" is going to have a problem this election cycle.\"But if you've been out and you're connected to the community and you've been doing the work, if you're not taking anything for granted and you're running an aggressive campaign, I think you'll make it through whatever storm should be coming in November,\" Tisei told GBH News.If Republicans do lose any of the 13 seats the party is defending this cycle, not much may change in the Democrat-dominated House, where Speaker Robert DeLeo's caucus already has a 127-to-31 advantage.Democratic political strategist Jay Cincotti said an even slimmer Republican caucus emerging from 2020 with fewer moderates from \"purple\" districts would leave a leaner, meaner GOP.\"It probably does empower the extremes of the party with respect to the minority party in this case. So I think if you saw Democratic gains, I think we would see an emboldened extreme right sort of get more noisy,\" Cincotti said.A larger Democratic majority would make it easier for Democrats to override Gov. Charlie Baker's occasional veto, but by flipping vulnerable \"purple\" seats now held by Republicans into the Democratic column, DeLeo could find himself with a greater number of moderate members less willing to take on contentious progressive goals.A counterexample was what happened in the state Senate when it's GOP caucus shriveled to one-tenth of the chamber and Democrats used the super-majority to force a more progressive agenda than had been seen before.\"I think the increase of a Democratic majority will embolden the progressive to try to get louder and to advocate for their positions more aggressively,\" Cincotti said.However the election goes, Tisei is confident that the conservative message of Governors Baker, Jane Swift, Paul Cellucci and Bill Weld will be represented on Beacon Hill. Tisei called Republicans that hold Democratic-leaning seats \"above average to exceptional,\" in their political skill and bipartisanship.\"They're all superstars in their own right that they were able to get elected in Massachusetts in the first place,\" Tisei said.",

      "body": "It\u2019s unlikely Donald Trump will win Massachusetts this week, and even more unlikely likely he\u2019ll win Boston, where Hillary Clinton got 81 percent of the vote in 2016. But in one small pocket of the city, the odds of a Trump victory are actually pretty good.Maureen Feeney, the former Boston City Councilor and current city clerk, has lived in the area in question \u2014 Ward 16, Precinct 12 \u2014 for half a century. (On a map of Boston, it\u2019s the city\u2019s southeastern tip, right across the Neponset River from Quincy and Milton.) It is, Feeney says, a place where voting is a social event.\u201cYou\u2019d have cake sales from St. Brendan\u2019s grammar school, people talking and holding signs, giving jabs here and there,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cIt\u2019s just always been a critically important component of living in this neighborhood.\"In addition, Feeney says, 16-12 can feel like a world unto itself, where the same families living side by side for generations creates what feels like a small town in the midst of the city.\u201cSo many of the people who\u2019ve lived here have married or whatever and have bought their parents\u2019 house, or a neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d Feeney said. \u201cI see Brian and Stevie and Amanda and they\u2019re all bringing their kids \u2014 but they used to walk by my house when they were going to school.\u201d If you\u2019re an outsider and visit 16-12, you\u2019ll probably notice Florian Hall, the headquarters for the Boston Firefighters Union. The streets are full of single- and two-family homes with well-kept yards decked out for Halloween \u2014 not to mention a lot of American flags. Florian Hall, the headquarters of the Boston firefighter's union (side view)You might not see a single 'Donald Trump for President' sign. But that absence is deceptive.\u201c[Trump] didn\u2019t win a single precinct in Boston, but he came damn close in 16-12,\u201d said Yawu Miller, the senior editor of the Bay State Banner. \u201cHe got 46 percent of the vote.\u201dEvery election cycle, Miller studies Boston\u2019s election returns, looking for unusual results. And every election, 16-12 stands out. In 2017, for example, Mayor Marty Walsh crushed challenger Tito Jackson, winning a whopping 95 percent of the vote. And in 2018, when Rachael Rollins won the Democratic primary in the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s race, her push for criminal justice reform drew support citywide \u2014 but not here. \u201cShe received 20 votes,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd Greg Henning. the candidate who was backed by the police unions, received 360 votes.\u201dLarry DiCara, the former Boston City Councilor and mayoral candidate, says that outcome \u2014 and Trump\u2019s strong performance two years earlier \u2014 may reflect the fact that 16-12 is packed with residents who work in public safety. A homemade sign supporting police on Whitridge Street in Boston's Ward 16, Precinct 12\u201cIt\u2019s a neighborhood with a high percentage of people who are police and fire, and police have strongly supported Donald Trump,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cCertainly in the great debate about reforming the police department, and issues of liability, Donald Trump stands with the police, notwithstanding that generally, he\u2019s anathema to organized labor.\u201dMany firefighters are standing with the police during that debate, too \u2014 including their statewide union, the Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts, whose website laments \u201cunrelenting attacks\u201d on \u201cour Brothers and Sisters in blue.\u201dBut DiCara said he believes the roots of 16-12\u2019s unusual political identity go back further. He points to 1983, when Ronald Reagan stopped by the Eire Pub \u2014 a literal stone\u2019s throw from the precinct\u2019s northwestern corner \u2014 for a beer and some potent cultural symbolism. \u201cRonald Reagan was able to relate to white, middle-class people far better than any Republican had up to that time,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cThe Eire Pub visit was a real message that \u2018I\u2019m one of you folks, I\u2019m one of the guys! I\u2019ll have a cold one at the Eire!\u2019\u201d Back then, DiCara says, you could find precincts like 16-12 throughout the city.\u201cThese are churchgoing people,\u201d DiCara said. \u201cThe majority of them are white. The great majority of them are Irish. [They\u2019re] very set in their ways, and that includes politics.\u201dModuleNow, as affluent newcomers gentrify Boston, 16-12 has ceased to be representative. Instead, it\u2019s an outlier.Still, one big question remains: How could so many voters back Trump one year and Walsh, a vocal Trump critic, the very next?DiCara notes that when Walsh was a state represenative, 16-12 was part of his district.\u201cHe knows almost everyone in that precinct by first name,\u201d DiCara said of Walsh. \u201cHe knows when Johnny\u2019s going to graduate from B.C. High, or Mary\u2019s going to graduate from UMass Boston, or whatever the case might be.\u201dBut Miller has a different explanation. \u201cPeople used to say people would vote primarily on ethnicity in Boston, next on neighborhood \u2014 they\u2019d vote for somebody from the neighborhood regardless of their ethnicity \u2014 and ideology was like the last thing,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo it was always more tribal.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s beginning to flip \u2026 almost everywhere, except that little section,\" he said. On Tuesday, as Boston\u2019s presidential results trickle in with what\u2019s likely to be a minimal amount of drama, that little section might just be a national bellwether, telling us if Trump\u2019s white, working-class support is as strong as it was four years ago.

      "body": "The state Department of Public Health released new details last week about the sources of COVID-19 clusters in Massachusetts, using data from the state's contact tracing efforts. But in some ways, the data raise more questions than answers.While Gov. Charlie Baker and other public officials have repeatedly said the biggest risk of infection was coming from social gatherings, particularly among young people, the data show that the vast majority of COVID-19 clusters were traced back to transmission within households. A household \"cluster\" is defined as two or more people living at the same address who were infected within four weeks of each other. The state's weekly COVID-19 report, released Thursday, stated that there have been 3,854 such household clusters in the state, leading to 7,428 confirmed cases. By comparison, contact tracing found 33 clusters that could be traced back to social gatherings, leading to 79 confirmed cases. Those clusters led to testing of another 96 \"close contacts,\" who were found not to be infected.Long-term care facilities were the second most common setting for clusters, with 141 clusters leading to 811 cases. Fifty-five child care clusters led to 78 coronavirus infections.Epidemiologists and infectious disease experts say the rate of spread within households is unsurprising.\"It's an issue of proximity and duration,\" said Dr. Erica Shenoy, associate chief of the Infection Control Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"We spend a lot of time in our home together. And if there are more of us in close quarters, it provides more opportunity for the infection to spread.\"That is a factor in the higher rates seen in many of the state's lower income communities, said Dr. Paul Biddinger, chief of the Division of Emergency Preparedness at MGH, and director of the MGH Center for Disaster Medicine. \"I think [it] underscores some of the disparities that we see in transmission, where communities with high housing density, high number of people in any given household, especially multi-generational, remains a significant risk,\" Biddinger said. People let their guard down at home, said Tory Mazzola, a spokesperson for the state COVID-19 Command Center, in a statement. \"It's critical that residents are aware of this and -- especially those living in multi-generational homes or with family members who have underlying conditions -- take precautions even in their home, such as wearing a mask, washing hands and not sharing utensils, as a few examples.\" But household clusters don't happen in isolation. Someone still has to get infected somewhere else and bring the virus into a home. The new data doesn't shed much light on where those infections are happening.  The cases the state was able to trace to clusters account for 54 percent of the more than 150,000 confirmed cases the state has seen since the beginning of the pandemic.\"The case investigations and the tracing that we're doing is showing us that there is not one reason. There's not these super-spreader events that you see in other places,\" Boston Chief of Health and Human Services Marty Martinez said in a press call Friday.\"There's a lot of small little scenarios that are happening that is really increasing the spread, especially in different neighborhoods and different communities,\" he said. And that, Martinez said, underscores the need for people to wear masks and keep their distance when out in public.\"Massachusetts, I think, in general, has done a pretty good job at social distancing and mask wearing and things like that,\" Dr. Michael Mina of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health said in a press call Friday. \"Of course, we've seen even in Massachusetts that people are getting tired. People are going back to work. People are going back to school. And so community transmission is increasing again. And that will cause exponential increase through the households.\"And people infected in those households, he added, then go back out into the community and infect others.More than a third of the state's communities are now in the so-called \"red zone,\" meaning over the last two weeks, they've reported more than eight cases per day on average, per 100,00 residents. That's almost double the number of cities and towns in the red zone two weeks ago. The state as a whole is in the red zone for the third week in a row. Hospitalizations and deaths have been climbing steadily since early September, though not as sharply as the daily case counts. But that could change if the rising number of cases translates into more severely sick people.With the data from the state's contact tracing efforts showing that household transmission was the single biggest risk for clusters, the upcoming holidays could result in an additional spike in cases, as visiting family members and friends essentially increase the size of households overnight.\"We are all looking for connections, we all miss our families. We all want to have some joy at the holiday time and I very, very much appreciate that,\" said Biddinger. \"But I think hopefully people will try to find ways to have joy and to connect with their families in a way that doesn't significantly increase transmission. Because if we disregard the virus and just gather together without precautions, what happens in December and January could be very concerning.\"GBH News' Mark Herz contributed to this report.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the percentage of total infections the state has been able to trace to clusters.",

      "body": "A couple of years ago, Daymian Mejia, a senior at Lesley University in Cambridge, began experiencing thoughts of self-harm and suicidal ideation. The son of Dominican immigrants, the 23-year-old from Jamaica Plain is the first in his family to go to college. At Lesley, he studies digital film. He also has a mood swing disorder, which he said \"becomes like a tint over everything.\" \u201cEvery single emotion, everything that you do, just feels like it's somewhat distorted,\u201d Mejia said.   A young Latino attending a predominantly white school, Mejia said he had felt isolated on campus even before the pandemic.\u201cI could count every single person of color in the film program,\u201d he said. \u201cYou walk into a room and culturally, you know that there's no type of connection. I grew up very Americanized, but regardless, even just looking at this skin, there's a disconnect.\u201dNational data show Mejia, who is brown-skinned, is far from alone in feeling disconnected on campus. A national survey conducted this fall found 90 percent of students are experiencing stress or anxiety as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, and one in four say their depression has significantly increased since March. Students from historically underrepresented groups \u2014 Black, Latino and Native American students \u2014 were more likely to report they\u2019re stressed and depressed on campus and that they lack a sense of belonging, according to the survey of 2,000 college and high school students for Active Minds, a nonprofit that promotes mental health awareness among students.That disturbing trend is constant among both undergrads and graduate students, said Tabbye Chavous, director of the National Center for Institutional Diversity at the University of Michigan.\u201cLatinx, Middle Eastern and Arab American students may be particularly likely to report anti-immigrant treatment, regardless of their actual immigrant status,\u201d she said during a recent forum event hosted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Chavous' research finds that since March, Asian and Asian-American students are reporting increased xenophobia made worse by the pandemic and anti-immigrant political rhetoric. And Black students are also under significant stress.\u201cAnti-Blackness may uniquely impact Black students, showing up in their experiences of being treated with fear and suspicion, policing and monitoring, interactions based on anti-intellectual stereotypes,\u201d she said.GBH\u2019s Basic Black: Mental Health & College StudentsNationally, the pandemic is driving down college enrollment. As a result, many predominantly white schools are relying more on high-performing students of color who may need more support, financially and otherwise.Carlota Ocampo, provost at Trinity Washington University in D.C., said colleges can\u2019t just enroll these students \u2014 they should provide mental health supports to help them succeed.\u201cWe must recognize that American society is constructed in such a way that people of color have experiences that are different and that may be traumatizing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not a problem of the person of color. That's a problem of society.\u201dDuring a pandemic and one of the most bitter elections in American history, Ocampo said college students of color have been facing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety.\u201cIt's like we're living through the Spanish flu, the Great Depression, the riots of \u201868, all while Andrew Jackson is president,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're kind of like bothering everybody, so you can imagine all the more how these may be impacting people whose overall relationship to society just is fragile.\u201dOcampo is a national advisor to The Steve Fund, a nonprofit that advocates for mental health resources for underrepresented students. It recently made a series of recommendations to colleges, like revising the curriculum and widening the career pipeline.Chavous said it\u2019s also important to engage and promote professors who support students\u2019 mental health. \u201cWhen faculty are actually supported, incentivized and recognized for doing this work as important work, they\u2019re more likely to do it,\u201d she said.On Campus Radio: Stressed And Depressed On CampusAt Lesley, Mejia is on track to graduate this spring. He's trying to stay hopeful as he prepares to launch his career during a recession. But he said his pandemic depression is colliding with his seasonal depression.\u201cYou also have election stress and, even post-election, there\u2019s still going to be so much,\u201d he said before Nov. 3. Taking all of his classes online, Mejia can\u2019t see a therapist or even a professor face-to-face.\u201cI haven\u2019t even attempted to reach out because I'm not going to want to have a Zoom call to talk out my feelings with somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually, what I need is to be in-person with somebody, and that's literally eliminated.\u201dFor now, Mejia is coping the best way he knows how: by writing poetry and taking photographs. When things get really bad, he sends a text to a suicide prevention hotline. GBH News' Diane Adame contributed to this report.If you or someone you know is having thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or use the Crisis Text Line by texting \u201cHome\u201d to 741741.

      "body": "There are 50 contested races among the 200 legislative districts on the ballot Tuesday, with Republicans facing headwinds from a strong anti-Trump voted expected in Massachusetts and hoping to stem the tide of losses they absorbed during special elections this year.The numbers show a widespread lack of interest in serving on Beacon Hill, where Democrats have held supermajorities in both branches for nearly three decades, and there are some energized races to be settled.Most of the action is in House districts, where 34 incumbents face challengers and candidates are competing for eight open seats, in addition to the seven open seats settled during the Sept. 1 primaries.Two of the eight open seats are held by outgoing Republicans, Reps. Randy Hunt of Sandwich and Elizabeth Poirier of North Attleborough. Five are represented by retiring Democrats: Reps. Jose Tosado of Springfield, Thomas Petrolati of Ludlow, Stephan Hay of Fitchburg, Theodore Speliotis of Danvers and Harold Naughton of Worcester.The eighth open House seat is currently vacant after former Democrat Rep. John Velis of Westfield won a special election to the Senate in May.There are contested races in eight of the 40 Senate districts and no open Senate seats. Democrats snatched two GOP Senate seats in special elections, and Republicans currently represent only four districts.In the House, Democrats hold 127 of 160 seats, while Republicans hold 31. One district is represented by an independent lawmaker, while one remains vacant.SHNS Senate RacesHere's a look at some races to keep an eye on:-- Three Senate Republicans Challenged: Democrats reduced the six-man Senate GOP caucus to four this year after two Republican senators left for other opportunities and Democrats picked up their seats in a pair of May special elections. Of the remaining Republicans, only Minority Leader Bruce Tarr is running unopposed. Sutton Republican Sen. Ryan Fattman faces a challenge from Milford Democrat Christine Crean, a social worker. On the South Shore, Cohasset Democrat Meg Wheeler is challenging Sen. Patrick O'Connor, a Weymouth Republican. And in north central Massachusetts, voters will decide between Fitchburg Republican Sen. Dean Tran and Lunenburg Democrat John Cronin. Before Tran, who came to America as a refugee and is the state's first Vietnamese-American senator, was elected in a 2017 special election, Democrats had held the seat since 1993. A late March report from the Senate Ethics Committee -- which Tran derided as a politically motivated attack -- found that his office staff had been improperly engaged in campaign work during business hours, leading to his removal from the post of assistant minority whip. Cronin, an Army veteran who served in Afghanistan and is completing a law degree at Suffolk University, is running with the backing of a host of local Democrats, including U.S. Reps. Lori Trahan and Jim McGovern, outgoing state Reps. Stephan Hay and Harold Naughton, and Jennifer Flanagan, whose resignation for a seat on the Cannabis Control Commission cleared the way for Tran to join the Senate. Both campaigns have reported spending notable amounts -- Cronin reported spending more than $27,000 in September alone, and Tran more than $40,000, according to the Office of Campaign and Political Finance. - Katie Lannan-- GOP Active in Coastal Competition South of Boston: Ever since he won his seat in 2012, barely an election goes by without Democrats casting a nervous eye toward Rep. Josh Cutler and the Sixth Plymouth District. The South Shore district was held by Republican Dan Webster before Cutler won it for the Democrats, and he's had to fight to keep it ever since. After his first win in 2012 by 10 points, his margin of victory in the Duxbury-Hanson-Pembroke district narrowed to eight points in his 2014 race against Republican Joseph Sheehan. He had an easier time two years later, and ran unopposed in 2018, but Republicans are again hoping to retake the seat. Cutler, now of Pembroke, is running against Tatyana Medvedev Semyrog of his former hometown Duxbury. A widow and mother of three, Semyrog is touting support from police and pointing to her work in a number of Congressional offices, including former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown's office. Cutler's district is one in a corridor along the South Shore where competition for legislative seats is running hot. Rep. Kathy LaNatra of Kingston is running for a second term after winning in 2018 with just over 52 percent of the vote. She's up against Republican Summer Schmaling, a biology researcher from Halifax who has studied arsenic in drinking water and the influenza. First-term Rep. Patrick Kearney of Scituate also has a Republican challenger, Craig Valdez, with competitive Senate races from Weymouth to Falmouth helping to stir up voter interest along the entire coast. Republicans have controlled a few districts on Cape Cod and in Plymouth County, and they are trying to stitch together more red districts leading up the South Shore coast toward the district represented by Republican Rep. David DeCoste of Norwell. To do so, they'll need to hold the district that Sandwich Republican Rep. Randy Hunt is giving up. Republican Steven Xiarhos of Barnstable is competing against Democrat James Dever of Sandwich in that race for the First Barnstable District. - Matt Murphy and Michael P. Norton-- Sen. Rausch v. Matt Kelly: Voters in the Senate district that snakes from Wayland down into Attleboro have a choice between Franklin Republican Matt Kelly, in his first campaign for state-level office, and Needham Democrat Sen. Becca Rausch, who herself unseated a Republican two years ago. This is the district that former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown represented when he served in the state Senate. Rausch turned the Norfolk, Bristol and Middlesex District blue when she defeated Brown's successor, former Republican Sen. Richard Ross of Wrentham, by about 2,000 votes in 2018 to become just the second Democrat to represent the district - the other was Cheryl Jacques. Before running for Senate, Rausch worked as a health care attorney in the Patrick and Baker administrations and had been elected as a member of Needham Town Meeting. For the last 12 years, Kelly has served in elected roles on the Town Council and School Committee in Franklin, where he has lived since the early 1990s and where he operates a real estate business. When he announced his first run for state-level office earlier this year, Kelly said that \"the majority of voters in this district are fed up with narrow agendas and a lack of concern for the bread-and-butter issues that each of our community's face.\" - Colin A. YoungMass Senate Districts In Play On Election Day 2020-- North Attleborough Councilors Square Off: Two North Attleborough Town Council members are running to replace retiring Rep. Elizabeth Poirier, the second assistant minority leader. Republican John Simmons is hoping to keep the district that includes all of North Attleborough and parts of Mansfield and Attleboro red with the backing of Poirier and Gov. Charlie Baker. Simmons got into the race late, in early September, after another Republican hopeful backed out. A North Attleborough native, Simmons is a lawyer, Boy Scout leader and youth sports coach. He has served as a member of the town's elected Representative Town Meeting and Election Commission, and serves on the first Town Council since the town changed its form of government. Democrat Adam Scanlon is hoping to win the 14th Bristol District for the Democrats with the backing of outgoing Congressman Joseph Kennedy III and former Gov. Michael Dukakis. Before being elected to the Town Council, Scanlon served on the town's School Committee. He says he currently works for \"a social services organization that assists economically disadvantaged citizens with job placement\" and is pursuing a master's degree from Northeastern University. 2021 will be the first time the 14th Bristol District is represented by anyone other than a Poirier since Gerald Ford was in the White House. Elizabeth Poirier was elected in a 1999 special election to succeed her husband, Kevin, who had represented the district in the Massachusetts House since his first election in 1976. - Colin A. Young-- The Battle of Westfield: The more than 41,000 residents of Westfield have had no representation in the Massachusetts House since May, when former Rep. John Velis, a Democrat, won a special election to fill a Senate seat. Voters will choose whether to fill that vacuum with Democrat Matt Garlo, Republican Kelly Pease or Independent Compassionate Conservative Ethan Flaherty. Pease, a retired Army officer and former Chester selectman, has experience on Beacon Hill already, spending a year as a legislative aide for former Sen. Donald Humason. Pease describes himself as \"a conservative who believes that government shouldn't just continue to raise taxes but should stay within their budget like every working family\" and a Second Amendment supporter. Garlo studied political science, sociology and pre-law at Siena College, where he earned a degree in May 2019, and is running his first-ever campaign on a platform including securing additional funding for schools and state reimbursement for contaminated water treatment. Although Garlo is a year removed from college, he is not the field's youngest candidate: Flaherty is a recent high school graduate. Republicans will eye the Fourth Hampden District as a potential pickup -- the GOP carried the district from 1978 to Velis's first victory in 2014 with candidates like Humason, Cele Hahn, Michael Knapik and Steven Pierce, and even with Velis in office, it has leaned toward Republican candidates in other races. - Chris Lisinski-- Warren-Backed Challenger Eyes House GOP Leader: The last time a Democrat ran against House Minority Leader Brad Jones, it was 2008, and Jones, who's served in the House since 1995, handily won reelection with 71 percent of the vote. This year, Michelle Mullet's bid against the longtime incumbent has attracted attention from outside their shared hometown of North Reading. Boston City Councilor Julia Mejia endorsed Mullet, as has U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who said Mullet would be the first woman and first Latina to represent the district and is \"leading on progressive ideas that will bring about big change \u2014 like implementing a Massachusetts Green New Deal, protecting and expanding access to reproductive care, and ensuring campaign finance reform is a priority on Beacon Hill.\" Jones is running with the backing of Gov. Charlie Baker, who said in an endorsement video that he wants to make sure voters know Jones has done \"a terrific job representing the people of his district and the people of the commonwealth in his role as minority leader for as long as I've been in state government.\" Despite Jones' long tenure in the Legislature, Baker said he \"fights with the enthusiasm of a newcomer\" and called him \"a problem-solver and a bipartisan operator at a time when we need much more of both.\" - Katie Lannan-- Lyons Looms Over Nguyen v. Dufour Contest: Democrat Rep. Tram Nguyen of Andover faces a challenge in her first re-election campaign from political newcomer Jeff Dufour of Tewskbury. DuFour, a Republican who has spent his career in information systems and project management, is vying to flip the seat back to the GOP after Nguyen ousted four-term Rep. Jim Lyons by a nearly 10-point margin two years ago -- a result that cleared the way for Lyons, a vocal Trump supporter and abortion opponent, to take the reins of the Massachusetts Republican Party. During her first term, Nguyen has joined in the push for natural gas safety in the wake of the 2018 Merrimack Valley explosions and for passage of the ROE Act, which would expand access to abortion. The state Democratic Party asked authorities for an investigation into a string of race-baiting robocalls in the district, which, according to a Boston Globe report, claimed to support Nguyen but misrepresented her positions, saying she supported defunding the police and \"making white Americans pay tax reparations.\" - Chris Lisinski-- Four Special Election Rematches: The four newest members of the House and Senate face rematches against opponents they defeated in special elections earlier this year, with a much higher turnout looming as the major difference this time around. Candidates on both sides of the aisle will be relatively fresh in voters' minds, having already campaigned in the spring, but the newly minted legislators have only a few months' record that they can tout or their challengers can critique. In three of those races, Democrats -- Sens. John Velis and Susan Moran and Rep. Carol Doherty -- will be looking to hang on to formerly red seats they flipped and are now running with the advantages of incumbency. In the fourth, Acton Democrat Rep. Danillo Sena will go another round against Lunenburg Republican Catherine Clark, whom he defeated 74 percent to 26 percent in June. In Taunton, Doherty had topped Republican Kelly Dooner 57-43 for the House seat formerly held by Mayor Shaunna O'Connell, and on Cape Cod, Moran, a Falmouth Democrat, bested Bourne Republican Jay McMahon -- a supporter of President Trump who ran for attorney general in 2018 -- by a similar margin of 56-44. What's now Moran's seat has bounced between Democrats and Republicans, last held by Plymouth Republican Vinny deMacedo and before that by former Senate President Therese Murray, a Plymouth Democrat. Velis, a Westfield Democrat, had been serving as a state representative until he claimed the seat vacated by Westfield Mayor Donald Humason in a May special election by beating Southwick Republican John Cain 64-36. - Katie Lannan-- Indy Candidates Try to Make a Dent: Unenrolled voters are the largest voter group in Massachusetts, but only one of the 200 sitting state lawmakers is not enrolled in one of the two major parties. Rep. Susannah Whipps of Athol had been a Republican until 2017, when she switched to an independent, and she faces a challenge from Athol Democrat William LaRose on Tuesday. Six other races involve only a sitting Republican or Democrat and a single independent challenger: Democrat Sen. John Keenan of Quincy vs. independent candidate Alexander Mendez of Quincy; Democrat Rep. Thomas Stanley of Waltham vs. unenrolled candidate George Darcy of Waltham; Democrat Rep. Michael Day of Stoneham vs. non-party candidate Elizabeth Harrah of Winchester; Democrat Rep. Danielle Gregoire of Marlborough vs. independent candidate Syed Hashmi of Westborough; Democrat Rep. Jerald Parisella of Beverly vs. unenrolled independent candidate Euplio Marciano of Beverly; and Republican Rep. Paul Frost of Auburn vs. independent candidate Terry Dotson of Millbury. - Chris Lisinski",

      "body": "Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is urging calm on and after Election Day, especially in the very possible scenario that there is not a clear winner in the presidential race by Wednesday or later. Walsh is also reminding any residents voting in person to continue to observe safety measures around the coronavirus, including wearing masks and standing at least six feet apart from others. Acknowledging heightened anxiety over the election, Walsh reiterated assurances that there are no known threats to public safety in Boston or anywhere in the commonwealth, and said the city is prepared to ensure a peaceful election and a safe public environment in the days and weeks that follow. To that end, Walsh and Boston Police Commissioner William Gross said that while they welcome lawful and civil demonstrations from across the political spectrum, acts of voter intimidation or any other lawlessness will not be tolerated, and the Boston Police Department is prepared to deploy quickly and aggressively in the case such incidents arise. \u201cI want to make it clear that voter intimidation is against the law and it won't be tolerated,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cAlso, I'm asking voters to respect the views of the people that might be standing there for different candidates, [to] respect their opinion as well.\u201d Gross said the BPD will be deploying a significant police presence throughout the city. \u201cWe want you to be comfortable in the fact that the Boston Police Department will be covering all polling sites,\u201d Gross said, noting that state law allows police officers to be present inside polling places, as well as outside. \u201cWe want everyone to know that we also have coverage for the neighborhoods, places of worship, schools, hospitals \u2013 you will see us out there.\u201d The enhanced presence of law enforcement and other public safety officials, Gross said, is simply \u201cfor the assurance that everybody is able to exercise their vote freely.\u201d Walsh also sought to reassure the public that while this may be an unusual election year, that should not erode faith in the integrity of the voting process, in Boston or nationally. \u201cWe should not be surprised if we don't hear a clear national result tomorrow night or Wednesday morning or for several days. That does not mean that the voting process is broken or compromised in any way,\u201d Walsh said. The mayor noted that while he expects election results will be clear for Boston and Massachusetts relatively early, Boston and other cities, like communities around the country, will likely be counting absentee ballots for several days following the election. \u201cBut I want to make it clear that mail-in ballots do not fundamentally change the process or cause a problem\u201d in election results, Walsh said. \u201cThey are handled like traditional absentee ballots. That's how we've always counted the votes of the military members and those people that are voting from overseas or out of state and the process of counting and certifying election results always takes a number of days before the election.\u201d ",

      "body": "Members of the Brookline Educators Union have overwhelmingly voted to go on strike, beginning Tuesday, over concerns about maintaining social distancing guidelines within school buildings. During ongoing bargaining agreements, Union President Jessica Wender-Shubow urged school officials to formally commit to 6 feet of social distancing in classrooms and throughout schools. Brookline Superintendent of Schools James Marini said he could not promise to maintain a 6-foot rule. He wrote in a statement to GBH News Monday that \u201ctaking any action that would limit our ability to adapt is irresponsible and would fly in the face of science and fact-based decision-making.\u201d Wender-Shubow said in an interview with GBH News Monday that the \u201cschool district wants to unilaterally allow the superintendent to decide how much social distancing there is based on his own personal interpretation of \u2018best practices.\u2019\u201dIn August, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education issued guidelines that a distance of 6 feet is \u201cpreferred whenever feasible,\u201d but 3 feet would be a \u201cminimum acceptable distance\u201d when combined with masks and other safety measures. \u201cDr. Marini has said repeatedly that he does not anticipate changing the 6-foot distancing unless something significant happens to change our understanding of best practices,\u201d Marini\u2019s statement reads. \u201cThis last part is key: best practices can change.\u201dThe School Committee voted Monday to file a petition for the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations to investigate the educators' proposed strike. \u201cThey're bringing the Department of Labor against us rather than try to work this out,\u201d Wender-Shubow told GBH News. \u201cThis is about a process, this isn\u2019t about not working. \u2026 The teachers here were already feeling like things were not being handled in a responsible, even remotely predictable and transparent way.\u201d The School Committee asked the union to reconsider the strike, but Wender-Shubow said direct action is in the best interest of the union\u2019s 1,200 members, 90% of whom voted Sunday night in favor of the strike. \u201cWhat would I say to all of those educators? What would I say to them that had changed? Nothing has changed,\u201d Wender-Shubow said. \u201cSo what, they threatened me. We already knew that we were taking a risk, they should thank us for doing it. They should thank us for standing up for these kids and for one another. All we're asking for is process.\u201dMore than 500 of the union\u2019s members live in Boston, where Mayor Marty Walsh called for schools to roll back to remote learning after a spike in COVID-19 cases last month. \u201cSo you want people coming and going into the city, day in and day out, and you will not commit even to a process that is fair, to community standards,\u201d Wender-Shubow said. \u201cSo we said, let\u2019s say when the CDC and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health say that we can relax those standards, we will then sit down with you and figure out the logistics, we\u2019ll bargain with you. They said no.\u201dThough education unions and school committees in Arlington, Boston, Hanover, Hingham, Milton, Wellesley and Weston have reached agreements that include 6 feet of social distancing, Marini argued in his statement that flexibility will be necessary to ensure safety for students and staff members. \u201cBecause of this rapidly-evolving situation, [Public Schools of Brookline] must retain the ability to continue to adhere to best practices,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cAt any point before the end of the school year, the optimal mix of protective measures may be very different and less reliant on distancing.\u201d Members of the teachers' union can\u2019t move forward on those terms, Wender-Shubow said. \u201cThey feel so disrespected and so rightfully scared that there's nobody watching this, that all the public health stuff is just a little bit too arbitrary.\u201d ",

Charlie Baker.The separating out of COVID-19 case growth by age coincides with recent warnings from the administration that spread among people under 30 has become more prevalent that among those over 60, which is a reverse from the early days of the pandemic.Baker announced a new set of curfews and gathering size limits on Monday in an attempt to reduce the frequency of parties and private social events that the administration has blamed for the uptick in cases since the weather forced more people indoors.\"As we've seen, people testing positive for COVID is a much younger population compared to April,\" Sudders said.The new daily reports are now expected to be published by 5 p.m. every day, which is an hour later than they are usually posted online. The weekly public health report, which includes information on community level virus spread and the origin of COVID-19 clusters, will also be reformatted, Sudders said, but the raw data will continue to be available.

They also said they will pursue repayment plans and seek mediation as first steps before turning to formal eviction proceedings.Massachusetts leaders implemented a moratorium on most non-emergency evictions and foreclosures for the first six-plus months of the pandemic, but Gov. Charlie Baker allowed it to expire in October as he unveiled a $171 million plan that allocates more funding for rental assistance and streamlines applications.Despite that effort, many housing justice advocates have warned that a flood of evictions is already starting, which could push Bay State renters into crowded living conditions while the virus remains a threat or onto the street.\"With this pledge, we reaffirm our ongoing commitment to support tenants and to ensure owners don't have to resort to eviction of those who are not able to pay their rent because of financial hardship due to COVID-19,\" GBREB CEO Greg Vasil said in a press release. \"We stand with our members who have been working with their residents in good faith and have taken this pledge to continue to maintain housing stability across Massachusetts throughout the pandemic.\"As of Monday, at least 10 companies signed onto the board's housing stability pledge, according to a press release: Chestnut Hill Realty, Avalon Communities Inc., National Development, Windsor Property Management, Winn Residential, Equity Management Realty, Wingate Management, Schochet Companies, Peabody Properties Inc., and Corcoran Management Company.Collectively, they own thousands of apartment units in Massachusetts and more than 300,000 nationally, according to a GBREB spokesperson.

      "body": "It's Election Day, and some states continue to deal with questions around how and when votes will be counted. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University law professor and GBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed to update us on some of the voting rights lititgation we've seen this election season. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: We spent a lot of time last week talking about Pennsylvania, the notorious swing state. Republicans are trying today to overturn a state court decision that would allow mail-in ballots to be received as late as this Friday as opposed to Election Day today. Has that been resolved, Daniel? Daniel Medwed: Well, fortunately, yes \u2014 for the time being, at least. Here's what happened. The state Republican Party filed multiple requests with the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn that state decision, but the Supreme Court thwarted those attempts, basically saying it was too close to the election [and] didn't want to meddle in state voting law. What's alarming about the decision, though, at least for those of us who are really concerned about protracted post-election litigation, is that three justices \u2014 Alito, Gorsuch and Thomas \u2014 hinted that they thought this lawsuit had merit [and] that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court usurped the authority of the state legislature when it pushed back the deadline for receiving mail-in ballots. And some people think that's an overture, an invitation, or at least an opening for the state Republican Party to renew its lawsuit as soon as tomorrow. The Keystone State is really key to the post-election litigation puzzle, I think. Mathieu: We talked about \"naked ballots\" last week. You mentioned that a state requires voters to submit mail-in ballots in a security sleeve. If you don't, they're naked; they don't count. We've seen estimates, Daniel, that could affect thousands of votes. What do you think of that? Medwed: Well, that's right. In another decision, the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court said that those naked ballots are invalid; they won't be tabulated. And that could, as you point out, jeopardize up to 100,000 votes. That's the estimate I've seen. Now the good news is, if there's any, the Department of State in Pennsylvania \u2014 the equivalent of our secretary of state's office here in Massachusetts, which monitors and oversees the electoral process \u2014 [has] issued some guidance, and they've said to voters, if you think that there's a deficiency with your mail-in ballot, maybe it's a naked ballot or it has some other infirmity, there are options to cure it. You can come down to your polling place today and file a provisional ballot. The problem is that's cold comfort, of course, to people who might not even know about their deficiency. And evidently, counties across Pennsylvania are taking various approaches in terms of how effective they are and aggressive they are in alerting voters about potential problems. Mathieu: I want to go to New Hampshire, Daniel, because over the past few years, as you well know, there's been a dispute surrounding the eligibility of college students to vote in New Hampshire. This comes up every two to four years. How has it been resolved? Medwed: Well, I think we have some clarity finally on it in New Hampshire. Here's how it's supposed to work. Traditionally in most states, college students are allowed to vote in the place where they're attending school as long as they're domiciled in that state \u2014 they've attained residency status. And that's how it worked in New Hampshire for many, many years. That is until 2017, when state Republicans changed the law to basically make it much harder to achieve a domicile status. That led to an avalanche of litigation, which culminated in a state court decision in April 2020, where a New Hampshire Superior Court judge ruled that those Republican efforts were unconstitutional. Even though that decision is currently up on appeal, it is the law of the Granite State. College students may vote in this election in New Hampshire if they are otherwise eligible to vote. There are, of course, many complications stemming from the coronavirus epidemic because [many] college students in New Hampshire and elsewhere are learning remotely. And that does pose a fly in the ointment. Mathieu: So how does that work for voting purposes? Remote learners are treated as living in New Hampshire, their home states or somewhere [else]? Medwed: Well, here's how it works, or at least how we think it will work. So on the one hand, seniors, juniors and sophomores who were in residence in New Hampshire during the last academic year before the spring surge and the lockdown, they're treated under New Hampshire law as temporarily displaced and they're eligible to vote. They could send in their absentee ballot or, I guess, conceivably drive up to New Hampshire today to do it in person. But on the other hand, incoming freshmen who have never actually resided in New Hampshire and are learning remotely now are ineligible to vote, even if they otherwise are over the age of 18 and so on.

There's been some improper ID checks. We've gotten some reports that it seems to be targeted at Latinx voters, so we're paying attention to that. That's been in Jamaican Plain and Lawrence.\"Rose said there have been calls related to voters who requested mail-in ballots, but then decided to show up to their polling location to cast their ballot in person, as well as calls to report people driving trucks with political flags near polling locations.\"We're nonpartisan, but we've had some reports of people in big trucks with Trump flags ... cruising past the polling places,\" she said. \"The main thing is that they have to stay at least 150 feet away from a polling place.\"Rose said monitors trained by the ACLU do just what their name implies: monitor polling locations across the state to ensure the \"voting process has integrity, and that people are being able to vote and exercise the right to the franchise.\"When they see something that might indicate some form of voter intimidation, or just have a question about the process, they call the Election Protection hotline at 1-866-OUR-VOTE. ACLU officials then determine whether the Secretary of State, local election officials, or even the police, need to be informed of the incident, said Rose.Click on the audio player above to hear the full interview.",

In her role with PYD, Gray recruits disabled youth for the many programs offered at the organization, from theatre groups to advanced mentoring programs \u2014 a service, she thinks, that has been especially beneficial throughout the pandemic. \u201cI think that the whole pandemic has been really tough on the disabled community. Not being able to go out, not being able to be social with your friends. I feel that it\u2019s really detrimental to the progress of people of any age [and ability].\u201dGray\u2019s many roles within the disabled community have caused her confidence to flourish, she says.

To be able to tell your story and to be able to explain to the people in charge is really important\u2026 If you can say what you want, at least they know that there is somebody who would like this to change.\u201dAsk For What You NeedGray\u2019s belief in the value of individual voice and experience ties in tightly with her thoughts on the importance of voting \u2014 and while her words are directed at the disabled community, they ring true for everyone:\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to be different. And don\u2019t feel that what you\u2019re asking is wrong\u2026. You\u2019re the future, and you\u2019re able to make a change, so go out and make that change,\" she said.So, what does that future look like for Gray? And what changes would she like to see for her community?\u201cThere\u2019s an estimated 38 million registered voters that have some form of a disability,\u201d she tells me. \u201c[And] being able to get to the polls has been one of those topics that I have seen be a challenge\u2026 Having different transportation agencies and bringing people [to the polls] from different places. If we are able to voice our choice, then people should be able to get to the place where they can voice that choice.\u201dIf You Can Vote, Vote",

She is now the Executive Director of the Disability Law Center. \"So therein lies the intersection between civil rights and disability rights,\" she said.Her team's efforts to ensure that this year's elections were accessible to all voters began nearly a year ago, when the Disability Law Center started working with state and local officials to ensure that the language used for mail-in voting met the same accessibility standards as those for voting in person. Given health and safety considerations due to the coronavorus pandemic, it became even more important to ensure that all voters could safely cast their ballots, whether at the polls or from home.\"Don't we all have the right to vote indepdendently and privately?\" she said. \"Someone with a disability should not have less of a right than someone without a disability.\" Along with ensuring that mail-in ballot procedures were ADA compliant, her team also conducted polling site visits across the Commonwealth to make sure that proper protocols, including handicap parking and signage, and equipment, including accessible AutoMARK voting machines, were in place and set up for early and Election Day voting. They also checked out ballot dropboxes, a new voting vehicle for this unprecedented election cycle.Asked if there is anything voters can do to help their disabled neighbors at the polls this year, Sallo said: \"When you pull up to your polling site, just take it all in... I think it's important just to raise that awareness.\"\"It's about empathy,\" she said. \"It's about caring for your neighbor.\"",

After an election season steeped with worry about the spread of the coronavirus, the economy and job-losses, as well as rising fear that the election results could be contested, some voters showed up at election sites with a fierce determination to have their say at the ballot box. Others waited dutifully in long lines that coiled around schools, libraries and other polling sites for more than 30 minutes in the cold for their chance to vote. And social media was awash in the people proudly displaying their \u201cI voted\u201d stickers on both sides of the aisle.Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin had predicted record turnout and nearly half of all registered voters in the state had already cast mail-in or absentee ballots three days before the election. Another 1.3 million are expected to vote on election day.Those are voters like Janet Meany of Back Bay. \u201cI needed to put that ballot in the box myself, to get rid of [President Donald] Trump,\u201d Meany said as she left the voting booth at the Boston Public Library on Tuesday afternoon. Casting her ballot in person allowed her to excise the \u201cstress of that idiot in the White House\u201d who mishandled the coronavirus and inhumanely separated migrant children from their parents at the border, she said.On her heels was Lisa Koch, a Trump supporter who reserved her sharpest criticism for Joe Biden\u2019s vice presidential running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Calling her \u201cinsanely narcissistic\u201d and an opportunist, Koch said that she could not stomach the thought that she would be next in line for the presidency if Biden is elected.\u201cI\u2019d much rather do it in person,\u201d she says. \u201cIt feels more satisfying.\u201dThat sense of election fervor could be felt throughout the state, even though Massachusetts is overwhelmingly blue and a world away from the battles in heavily contested states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas. More than 100 million Americans voted early and votes cast in person are expected to represent a significant minority of all votes nationally. 20201102_JTO_Election082.jpgIn Massachusetts, the group Lawyers for Civil Rights Boston, which trained more than 200 volunteers to watch polls and answer election questions, said voting lines were excessively long in Mattapan, Dorchester and Hyde Park with wait times in excess of 40 minutes. The group also said at one polling site in Lawrence, voters who had not received mail-in ballots were being told they could not vote.Brighton resident Evan Scorpio said he and his wife requested mail-in ballots due to their concerns about COVID-19. Their mail-in ballots never came, he said. The couple cast their votes at the Alexander Hamilton School in Brighton Tuesday, saying this election was too important to miss.\u201cLuckily, it was really quick \u2014 no line,\u201d Scorpio said.In Provincetown, across the street from Town Hall, Sean McNulty and his brother Tim, the owners of the Lobster Pot restaurant, offered free hot chowder to voters on election morning. \"We love our town. We're ready for a new beginning,\" said Tim McNulty, dressed entirely in blue and unwilling to state his voting preference outright. \"Today's voting day, and this is in the spirit of democracy and community.\"The cold temperatures also didn\u2019t stop a steady flow of voters from hitting the polls in Franklin, a town of 30,000 in the southeastern corner of the state. More than half of registered voters have cast their ballot early, but not resident Lawrence Allers.He said he wasn\u2019t concerned about whether his mail-in ballot would be counted or the recent resignation of the town clerk during the primary. \u201cWe just gotta be patient, pay attention and do the right thing,\u201d Allers said. \u201cI think we\u2019ll move on from this and get everybody back to normal and shakin\u2019 hands and having dinner together.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t clear if he was talking about the coronavirus or the presidential election. Those two issues have overshadowed other key votes, including a U.S. Senate race that pits veteran Democrat Sen. Ed Markey against a Republican challenger, attorney Kevin O'Connor.There are also two \"yes or no\" ballot questions asking voters to decide who has control over a car's wireless data and whether to adopt a ranked choice voting system.20201102_JTO_Election076.jpgInstead, voters were laser-focused on the next person to occupy the White House. Charles and Penny Garcia showed up at the polls at Stoneham Town Hall wearing matching American flag jackets.\"I'm here to vote for Trump,\" Charles Garcia said. \"I'm 64. I only voted twice in my life. Once, four years ago for Donald Trump. And again today for Donald Trump. It's all I vote for.\"He said he's supporting Trump because he says Trump is a real man, and politicians are liars. And he likened mailing his vote to putting $500 cash in the mail and sending it to yourself. In Worcester, Martin and Amanda Gjoni's were hoping to teach their four-year-old son Benny that voting is vital to democracy. They took time-off from work on Tuesday to go to the polls as a family.\"We try not to sugar coat a lot of things with him,\" said Amanda Gjoni. \"We like to let him know what's going on. We watch the news. He watches it with us. We explain it to him the best that we can. So he's not in the dark about a lot of things. He actually has a decent understanding as far as a four-year-old ...for what's going on in the world.\" Benny said he is already thinking ahead to 2024, when he hopes the ticket includes \"Spiderman.\"Back at the Boston Public Library, 19-year-old Anna Rose Read and her mother, Clair Beard Read, cast their votes. The mother and daughter contracted the coronavirus last March, and Clair Beard Read, who is a medical doctor, said her symptoms still linger. She blames Trump for not doing more to stop the virus\u2019 deadly spread.\u201cHe\u2019s so concerned with the effects of COVID on the economy, he refused to acknowledge how deadly it was,\u201d she said. Both women said they were concerned that Trump was undermining democracy by giving tax advantages to the wealthiest Americans while crafting immigration policies that punish poor children who cross the U.S. border.Staying home, she said, was simply not an option.Digital producer Meghan Smith, reporters Craig LeMoult, Carrie Saldo, Bob Seay, Marilyn Schairer, Esteban Bustillos and radio producer Amanda Beland contributed to this report.",

      "body": "Updated at 10:57 p.m. Massachusetts provided one of the few moments of certainty on a historically contentious election night as Democratic Sen. Ed Markey cruised to re-election over Republican challenger and first-time candidate Kevin O\u2019Connor. In heavily blue Massachusetts, Markey was always a favorite to win re-election to a second full term in the Senate after winning a special election in 2013 and then re-election in 2014. He had previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 37 years. The race was called by the Associated Press shortly after polls closed at 8pm. Former Vice President Joe Biden was also projected to win the state's 11 electoral votes. In a statement to Twitter, Markey wrote that \"voters in Massachusetts have reaffirmed the mandate of our grassroots movement. Together, we are going to fight for bold and systemic change in the United States Senate.\" \"I will fight every day to make you proud of your vote,\" Markey said during a livestreamed video statement to social media. He also reiterated his support for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, predicting a \"historic victory.\" The big question in this race was whether Markey would survive a Sept. 1 primary challenge from Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, who appeared to be the front-runner in early polls last year. Kennedy won the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but Markey got the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and was a leading co-sponsor with her of the Green New Deal, a sweeping proposal for action to fight climate change.  Kennedy and Markey each raised more than $10 million for the race, and Markey ended up winning by a comfortable 55%-45% margin. That left Markey with only O\u2019Connor to beat \u2014 a little known Republican lawyer from Dover who raised less than $1 million for his campaign. ModuleSpeaking to supporters in South Boston Tuesday evening, O'Conner said, \"we put up a robust fight, I think a great fight. And I think we won the argument on the merits.\" But, he added, \"you learn in competition that sometimes the victory isn't this game, it's the next game.\"The two faced off for one debate in early October that largely revolved around who was to blame for the coronavirus pandemic and whether Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump\u2019s pick to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s seat on the Supreme Court, should be confirmed. Markey tried to paint O\u2019Connor as being too aligned with the current occupant of the White House and O\u2019Connor argued that Markey is too far to the left of the mainstream Democratic Party to represent Massachusetts. In the runup to the election, both Republican and Democratic donors turned their attention elsewhere, spending millions funding Senate campaigns outside the state, a signal of how little doubt there was about the outcome here. Which party will control the Senate come January has been a major focal point of this year's election cycle with several Republican incumbents \u2014 from Maine to South Carolina to Iowa to Arizona \u2014 vulnerable to well-financed Democratic challengers.",

      "body": "Massachusetts voters have rejected a ballot initiative to instate ranked-choice voting. Supporters of the measure conceded early Wednesday morning, though the Associated Press had not yet called the race and there were still outstanding votes to be counted.The change would have applied to elections for most state and federal offices in 2022 and beyond, except for the presidency and in races where there are only two candidates.By about 2 a.m., 54% of ballots cast opposed the voting system change with about 83% of municipalities reporting results, according to the Associated Press.ModuleThe organized campaign behind the question took in nearly $10 million, bankrolled in large part by out-of-state contributors. Despite the expensive effort, advocates conceded via email at about 12:40 a.m. Wednesday. \u201cWe came up short in this election, and we are obviously deeply disappointed,\u201d Campaign Manager Cara Brown McCormick said in the statement. \u201cWe were attempting to do something historic in Massachusetts and fell short, but the incredible groundswell of support from volunteers and reformers that assembled behind this campaign is reason enough to stay optimistic about the future of our democracy.\u201d Opponents of ranked-choice, led by the Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, raised less than 1% of the opposing side's total.Their cause gained two high-profile allies late last month as Gov. Charlie Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito criticized the measure as one that would \u201cadd an additional layer of complication for both voters and election officials,\u201d the pair said in a joint statement.The state Republican Party also came out against the measure.Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance spokesperson Paul Craney declared almost certain victory in a written statement early Wednesday morning.\u201cOver 75 percent of the votes have been counted and it can be said with a great deal of certainty that the voters of Massachusetts have rejected Question 2,\u201d said Craney, vowing to release a full statement later.Massachusetts voters approved Question 1, a proposal crafted to compel auto-makers to relinquish control of all wireless data necessary to repair and diagnose cars beginning with model year 2022, Tuesday evening.The ranked-choice voting campaign coincided with Jake Auchincloss, the Democratic candidate in the race to replace Rep. Joe Kennedy III\u2019s seat, emerging victorious from a field of nine candidates with less than a third of ballots cast in the September primary. Advocates held up the race as an example of one that would have a different outcome within a ranked-choice system. Auchincloss defeated Republican challenger Julie Hall on Tuesday, the Associated Press reported.  Maine became the first state to utilize ranked-choice voting for its general election after voters approved it in 2016, then voted against a state legislature delay of the system in 2018.The Pine Tree State also became the first to use ranked-choice in a presidential election this year.",

      "body": "Election Day, as many predicted, is now turning into Election Week as states continue to tally mail-in and absentee ballots well after the polls closed. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University law professor and GBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed about some of the issues surrounding the vote counting process across the country. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: To be clear, though, to start off with regard to counting mail-in and absentee ballots, the system is actually working as designed right now. Daniel Medwed: Absolutely. As you indicated, as everyone in the media indicated, the fate of this election was not going to be determined last night because of the huge swath of absentee ballots due to the coronavirus [pandemic]. The counting process is going to take days and weeks. And in fact, the system already countenances this. For instance, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, state election officials don't have to actually certify their votes until November 23rd. In Wisconsin, it's not until December 1st. There's already flex in the joints of the system to account for just this very possibility. Mathieu: We've talked about this recently. Pennsylvania, you pointed out, is going to play a very important role in the outcome here. It could decide the election, and it will likely involve watching what's going on in the courts, Daniel. Any developments on the legal front since we talked about this just yesterday? Medwed: There are two cases that I'm watching coming out of Pennsylvania. First of all, late last night around midnight, some state Republicans filed a lawsuit based on the fact that the secretary of the Commonwealth \u2014 the person in charge of elections in Pennsylvania \u2014 had alerted some absentee voters about deficiencies in their ballots and given them an opportunity to cure those deficiencies yesterday by filing provisional ballots. The state Republicans tried to block provisional ballots from counting. So that just started last night, something to watch in the days ahead. The second case is one that's been brewing really for weeks, almost months now, and that's the issue of how the state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania extended the deadline for receiving absentee ballots from Election Day, which was the law in Pennsylvania, until Friday. The way it stands now, if you submitted your ballot by yesterday absentee in Pennsylvania, as long as it's received by Friday, it will count. State Republicans have challenged this at least twice unsuccessfully in the U.S. Supreme Court, but that case may be revived for a variety of reasons. Mathieu: You mentioned the Supreme Court, Daniel. This is what the president said. He invoked the court when he addressed the nation this morning: President Donald Trump clip: This is a major fraud in our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at 4:00 in the morning and add them to the list, OK? Mathieu: Now, Daniel, how do you think the Supreme Court would rule with respect to a renewed challenge to say the counting process in Pennsylvania [or] other states? And what fraud is he talking about? Medwed: Well, I have no idea what he's talking about. I think my objective legal analysis is that statement was absolutely absurd. It's not grounded in reality, though that hasn't stopped the president from making statements like that in the past. Here's my legal take on how the Supreme Court might approach this, Joe. So on the one hand, I do think this Pennsylvania case is going to be resuscitated. Justices Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch indicated as such just about 10 days ago in that final Supreme Court decision saying we're not going to intervene in Pennsylvania, it's a matter of Pennsylvania law [and] we're too close to the election. But those three justices hinted at the fact that they thought this lawsuit had merit, that the state Supreme Court had overstepped its bounds and basically sent an overture to state Republicans after Election Day, come back to us. So I think that case will come back to the Supreme Court. And now you have Justice Kavanaugh, who, even though he didn't join those three in that Pennsylvania opinion, had written a very sympathetic concurring opinion in a different case \u2014 in a Wisconsin case \u2014 where he basically cast aspersions on post-election vote counting. So if you add Kavanaugh to those three, you have four votes maybe against vote counting. And then, of course, there's the wild card of Amy Coney Barrett. We just don't know what she'll do. Mathieu: Any chance she might recuse herself? Medwed: Such an interesting issue. So here's how recusal works. In the lower courts, it's typically a matter of discretion. A judge can decide on his or her own whether she thinks there's a conflict of interest and should step down \u2014 recuse herself. And in the lower courts, that decision is reviewed on appeal under what's called abuse of discretion review. You'll look and basically defer to the lower court decision by that judge as long as they didn't abuse their discretion [and] as long as it wasn't an absurd decision. In the Supreme Court, however, there is no higher tribunal to appeal that decision to. So it's basically between the Supreme Court justice and their individual consciences, and we've had a lot of instances in recent years of justices stepping down. Justice Kagan has stepped down on a lot of cases that related to her role as solicitor general under President Obama, and even Justice Thomas stepped down in a very high profile admissions case stemming from the Virginia Military Institute because he happened to have a child at VMI at the time. So we just don't know what will happen with Amy Coney Barrett [or] how she feels about this. ",

      "body": "Despite a well-financed campaign with thousands of volunteers, the ranked-choice voting ballot intiative in Massachusetts was defeated by about 10 percentage points, according to Associated Press returns.So, why did the ballot intiative fail?Some political scientists say the proposed change to the state's election system may have appeared too confusing.\"These are turbulent times and the status quo is always a safer choice than change in general,\" said Suffolk University Political Science Professor Rachael Cobb. \"If people are hearing that it's complicated, especially when they're feeling like life is really complicated, they may say, 'You know, we've been doing it this other way for a long time, it seems to be OK. Why change?'\"ModuleCobb supported the question, which would have allowed voters to select multiple candidates for an elected position, ranked in order of preference.Supporters argued the sytem would be especially helpful in elections like the crowded Democratic primary for the 4th Congressional District seat being vacated by Rep. Joe Kennedy III.\"Most voters don't have any experience with ranked-choice voting,\" said Political Science Professor Peter Ubertaccio, dean of the Thomas and Donna May School of Arts & Sciences at Stonehill College. \"Most voters don't have any experience with any other kind of electoral system. So to inject a change such as that into the process of voting really requires some explanation in terms of what folks are hoping to achieve and then how it's going to work \u2014 and also the pros and cons of such a change.\"That explanation, Ubertaccio said, does not seem to have been heard or accepted by voters, possibly because of a confluence of factors during this election.\"Ballot questions in presidential election years suffer from a lack of political oxygen,\" he said. \"Everyone's thinking about the big races.\"Also, he said, proponents of ballot questions usually rely on community forums to get their message out. \"Community forums are very difficult to do in a pandemic,\" Ubertaccio said. Without those forums, he said, those supporting the measure were left to rely on television advertising, \"which is not always the best place to get at some of the underlying issues for complicated matters of public policy or electoral policy.\"Ubertaccio said changes like this are better made through the legislative process, where there's more room for thoughtful conversation.\"But ranked-choice voting could very likely threaten the electoral paths for members of the legislature, so it's not likely that we're going to see the change there,\" he added.Gov. Charlie Baker cited the added costs for holding elections and the complications that ranked-choice voting could present to the state's election system as he explained his opposition to the ballot question last week.\"We're seeing right now how tough elections are already and how complicated they can become, and to add this labyrinth into the system is just a terrible idea, and the average person gets that,\" said former Massachusetts secretary of state candidate Anthony Amore, who served as a spokesperson for the campaign against the ballot question.Those opposing ranked-choice voting were vastly outspent by the campaign supporting the ballot question, which took in nearly $10 million, in large part from out-of-state contributors. Amore said all that money might not have been an asset.\"One thing that didn't ring true for voters is the promise of the pro side that it would get money out of politics, while they were bringing in around $10 million to implement it,\" Amore said. \"So that seemed incongruous, I think, to people.\"In acknowledging the defeat, the ballot question's proponents highlighted that the campaign received over 128,000 signatures to get the question on the ballot and had 7,400 volunteers.\"Even amidst a global pandemic, we were able to mobilize a movement to strengthen our democracy in a time when it\u2019s needed most,\" Yes on 2 Campaign Manager Cara Brown McCormick said in a statement. \"We were attempting to do something historic in Massachusetts and fell short, but the incredible groundswell of support from volunteers and reformers that assembled behind this campaign is reason enough to stay optimistic about the future of our democracy.\u201d",

      "body": "As the nation anxiously awaited for the outcome of the presidential election late Wednesday afternoon, at least 200 demonstrators gathered in Boston Common to demand that every vote be counted. The demonstration came as President Donald Trump and Republicans repeated claims that mail-in votes are fraudulent, clashing with Democrats who maintain that time must be given for every ballot to be counted. As of 5:15 p.m. Wednesday, the race between Trump and former Vice President and Democratic nominee Joe Biden remained extremely close \u2014 Trump with 214 electoral votes and Biden with 248, and six states yet to be called, according to the Associated Press.  Tanisha Sullivan, president of the NAACP Boston Branch, which helped organize the event at the Common along with the ACLU of Massachusetts and other groups, said they were there to stand in solidarity with others across the country who are calling for all votes to be counted. Organizers said there were closer to 1,000 attendees by the end of the event. IMG_1572.jpg\"Every legally cast vote across this country that speaks to the heart of Americans should be, must be, counted,\" Sullivan said. Speaking to reporters at the event, Sen. Ed Markey, who had just won his own re-election campaign, invoked the American Revolution to call for all votes to be notched.\"It started right here, in Boston Common. This whole revolution of democracy in the United States of America. We started it. And it was towards the intent of making sure that we were not ruled by despots,\" Markey said. \"So we're standing here today demanding that every vote be counted in the United States of America.\"Markey said that the president and his supporters have attempted for months to cast a cloud over the election, pointing to Trump's early morning press conference where he essentially tried to claim victory and threatened bringing a case to the Supreme Court as an example of their actions.Markey said that justice was on the ballot, and claimed that Biden will become president if every vote is counted properly.IMG_1630 (1).jpg\"And we will not stand on the sidelines as Donald Trump seeks to short-circuit the counting of every single ballot, because there is just too much that is at stake for the future of the United States,\" he said. The event had an almost concert-like feel at times, with musical performances mixed in with speakers. And while the demonstration was peaceful, signs of preparation for any disturbances were visible along the fringes of the Common: boarded up stores and a visible police presence at the State House made for ominous foil to the event's energy and optimism. Another demonstration is planned for later Wednesday evening at Nubian Square.",

I\u2019ve voted in town and state before, but I was just 17 or 16, last election,\u201d he says. \u201c[I\u2019m] excited and nervous\u2026 it\u2019s like walking on a tight rope.\u201dWary of mail-in voting \u2014 the ballot box fire in Copley Square earlier this month convinced him of the dangers of the process \u2014 Rooney was determined to make it to the polls on Election Day to cast his ballot in person, even if that journey was difficult with his mobility issues. This year, his hometown of Amherst held their polls in a local gymnasium, which he hoped would be more accessible than the previous location in the town\u2019s firehouse. Plus, there was an important person he just couldn\u2019t let down.\u201cMy grandma\u2026 we both need help voting, so she\u2019s like my voting partner,\" he grins.Meet Cody RooneyBut it\u2019s not just Rooney\u2019s civic duty or loyalty to his grandma that made participating in this year's election especially important to him. He also wanted to fight for valuable resources for the many communities he inhabits.\u201c\u2026Funding is on the line, you know, with all these cuts, so we need to make our voices heard after years of silence and discrimination,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard not to sound biased. I know coming on here, I wanted to remain neutral to respect everyone, but it\u2019s kind of difficult... [we have] a leader that has made fun of people with disabilities. [And] I\u2019m not just disabled, but I\u2019m also Black and native. And those groups have been attacked over these four years.\u201dThe coronavirus pandemic has taken its toll on the many communities within which Rooney is an activist, as well. \u201cI\u2019m not a homebody, so it\u2019s mentally challenging,\" he said. \"To just know that I could be in Connecticut next week and doing a [Native] event\u2026 you know, that depresses me.\u201dAlong with the camaraderie that comes from participating in Native American events throughout the region, Rooney also misses them as a source of income. With events cancelled and travel out of the question, he has been left to rely on his family for financial support.\u201cI can\u2019t just go out and work at McDonald's or a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts because I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d be even a good cashier\u2026 So for this year, with everything cancelled, I really lean on my parents,\" he said. \"The pandemic has definitely hit me. But it wouldn\u2019t have if there were more accessible jobs. Without a doubt.\u201dIt\u2019s this mix of personal and professional loss that makes Rooney so passionate about casting his ballot this year \u2014 and why he thinks that people should take their responsibility to vote seriously. \u201cI hope they think [that]\u2026 even though they may not like the other candidate, they think about who they really vote for\u2026. even if causes a drastic change,\" he said.What I Hope For",

      "body": "As election results rolled in from states across the country, Yaritza Dudley raised her megaphone to a crowd of 500 protesters gathered on the steps of the Boston Public Library Wednesday night to deliver a message: \u201cDo not be fooled,\u201d the 22-year-old Dorchester-based activist warned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who sits at the head of the table if the table was built on a broken foundation.\u201d Dudley and youth activists from the Sunrise Movement, Socialist Alternative and other Boston chapters of local progressive organizations marched through the city from Nubian Square to Copley Square, calling for an end to voter suppression, racism and police brutality. Marching past outdoor diners in the South End and curious Back Bay residents poking their heads out of their windows, protesters held signs reading \u201cStop Trump\u2019s racist voter suppression\u201d and repeated chants denouncing fascism and the Trump administration. The protest was a push to continue the count of votes across the country, a denouncement of President Donald Trump, and \u2014 perhaps most emphatically \u2014 a reminder of the long road ahead for members of the Democratic Socialist party. \u201cDo not let Biden lead you into complacency,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans are the same oppressor with a different face. The difference between Democrats and Republicans is that Democrats smile as they put the knife through your body and your hopes towards a better future.\u201d Malden resident Luis Moreno said the demonstration was a necessary reminder that \u201cno matter who wins,\u201d the issues that protesters fought for over the summer will not disappear overnight. \u201cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris definitely should be in power, but that's not my priority,\u201d Moreno, 29, told GBH News. \u201cI don't think that's the priority of a lot of people here.\u201d Moreno said the ongoing national movement for racial equality has major implications in Boston, where he grew up. \u201cThe city is racist, it's segregated and it has discriminated against people of color, Indigenous people and Black folks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe election is not the end. Coronavirus doesn\u2019t stop, racism doesn't stop, inequality doesn't stop. People still don't know where their next meal is going to come from. That's not going to change until people in government actually do something about it.\u201d 20201104_JTO_march142.jpgBoston City Councilor and mayoral candidate Andrea Campbell, who stood at the back of the crowd in Nubian Square, said she agrees with that assessment of the city. \u201cI think for many, they want to say it's just a perception, but I represent a district right now that is predominantly a district of color in the city of Boston, and if you talk to people on the ground, they will absolutely say that the reality is that Boston is a racist city,\u201d Campbell told GBH News. \u201cWhat do they mean by that? COVID-19 devastating communities of color, all the poor people being concentrated in public housing that hasn't been renovated in 30 years, inequitable access to education, to jobs, to benefits \u2014 the list is long. All of these inequities run down the line, are broken up by race, by Black and Brown people disproportionately experiencing these inequities. That's because of race and racism.\u201d At the front of the group, Blaze Travis from the Socialist Alternative group called on the crowd to \u201cstart a movement\u201d in the face of not just Trump\u2019s legacy of policies, but a potential four years of a more centrist option.\u201cWhat did the Democrats provide as an answer to our hatred of Trump and his base and the Proud Boys and the billionaire class? They delivered down on us the most risky and uninspiring candidate imaginable to take on Trump, Joe Biden,\u201d Travis said. \u201cIn the middle of a country on fire, flooded, hungry, sick and unemployed, Biden came out of the gate saying if he was elected, nothing would fundamentally change.\u201d Travis urged the crowd to continue protesting \u2014 for students to walk out of classes, for labor unions to strike. \u201cWe need a mass movement, and with any mass movement we build, if it's capable of toppling Trump and his reactionary base and defending our democracy, then we cannot and we should not just stop there,\u201d Travis said. \u201cWe need to go out to make sure our movement goes beyond what is acceptable for Trump or even Biden, and that means taking up the demands that speak to us real working people.\u201d The long list of demands from activists in the organization includes curriculum changes in public schools to include Indigeonous history, funding to curb economic inequality in schools, reparations for slavery, a freeze on rent and mortgage payments during the pandemic, free COVID-19 testing, free housing for the homeless, hazard pay for essential workers, the release of inmates convicted for non-violent offenses, higher wages for union workers and the passage of a Green New Deal. Before protesters peacefully dispersed into the cold night, Yaritza Dudley emphasized another goal of the movement, one oft-repeated through the protests of the summer: defund the Boston Police Department, \u201cwho continue to distribute bullets through our bodies for target practice,\u201d she said.  A Biden presidency, Dudley warned, would not solve this problem. \u201cThese things will keep happening because it is the system,\u201d Dudley told the crowd. \u201cThey will try to disillusion us by telling us that things are better now, Trump is going to be gone soon. But that capitalist scum was simply the product of an oppressive blueprint that was laid out long before him.\u201d ",

      "body": "Last night, hundreds of protestors gathered in Roxbury\u2019s Nubian Square to protest President Donald Trump\u2019s request to stop counting ballots in some swing states, including Pennsylvania and Nevada, as the outcome of the presidential election hangs in the balance. The protestors marched through the evening, ending in front of the Boston Public Library in Copley Square. Phillip Martin, GBH News Senior Investigative Reporter, was there and joined Joe Mathieu today on Morning Edition to share what he saw.\u201cThe mood was worried and concerned, like across the entire country right now, Joe,\u201d said Martin. \u201cThere\u2019s a fear that if the votes are stopped \u2014 if in Pennsylvania, for example, they stop counting votes, or any other place in this country where they stop counting votes \u2014 that it will basically accede to an undemocratic process. And so there is a lot of anger and there is a lot of worry that, in their words, that Donald Trump might hijack the election.\u201dWhile outcry over the President\u2019s request to stop counting ballots remained at the fore, Phillip noted that there were many other reasons why protestors took to the streets last night.Protestors in Nubian Square\u201cThese are progressives, and socialists, leftists, liberals all mixed in this crowd,\" Martin said. \"Their first choice [for President] was not Biden, their first choice was Bernie Sanders. And so what they\u2019ve said is, \u2018Okay, we support Biden, but we will continue to campaign on a grassroots level to make sure that he keeps his promises on climate change, on Black Lives Matter, on looking at police violence and reform.'\u201dSecurity at demonstrations around the city has been an ongoing concern for residents and city officials alike. Martin noted that around 100 of the 500 protestors present were wearing neon vests, seemingly designated as marshals, in order to keep the gathering peaceful and make sure that the infiltration of extremist groups inciting violence \u2014 as has occurred at other protests around the country \u2014 was shut down.\u201cFrom the speakers, you heard people warn: \u2018If you\u2019re here,\u2019 said one guy. \u2018If you\u2019re here to cause violence, if you\u2019re here to set things on fire, to break windows, we want you to leave right now,\" Martin said. \"Because there is a growing realization that some of these individuals who have taken part in these demonstrations may not be who they say they are.\u201dRaw Html",

      "body": "The Massachusetts House of Representatives is going along with most of the budget plan put forward by Gov. Charlie Baker last month, which uses one-third of the state's rainy day savings to balance state finances ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz said his committee will present to the rest of the House membership a spending plan that concentrates on the neediest constituents while avoiding any drastic cuts, which he said \"was unthinkable back in the spring.\"\"This is a budget that pays bills, but concentrates on those who are most in need of our help,\" House Speaker Robert DeLeo said at a press briefing on the $46.02 billion spending plan, which would increase spending by .4 percent over what Baker laid out last month and 5.3 percent over last year's spending.\"It directs the largest increases to COVID student support [and] food security, while also emphasizing community day and work programs, substance addiction services, domestic violence and sexual assault treatment and prevention and legal assistance,\" DeLeo said.The House budget plan, delayed since the spring while lawmakers and the Baker administration wrangled falling revenues and inconsistent federal support, would spend $188 million more than the plan put forward by Baker and use slightly more of the state's \"rainy day\" stabilization fund to make ends meet.After previously rejecting Baker's idea to move up the monthly date when retail businesses remit taxes to the state \u2014 which would result in a one-time surge of $267 million \u2014 the House has now embraced the idea.\"It's one of those 'break glass in case of emergency' kind of conversations, and this is obviously a fiscal emergency,\" Michlewitz said of the sales tax change. \"So we think that it's the appropriate year to be doing this.\" The budget plan would provide around $180 million more for K-12 education than last year's spending to keep up with inflation, but it would not implement the Student Opportunity Act passed last year, which, when implemented, will increase school funding by $1.5 billion over seven years.Michlewitz said lawmakers were very eager to make this large investment but the pandemic has put it on hold.\"Fortunately, the Student Opportunity Act has a seven-year implementation period and we will be doing our best to implement that in the years to come,\" Michlewitz said.DeLeo said he expects to meet Baker's timeline of getting a finished budget plan to his desk by Thanksgiving \u2014 in three weeks. To achieve what would be a new record for the Legislature's bicameral budget negotiations. Michlewitz said he has worked closely with Senate counterpart Sen. Michael Rodrigues and Baker's budget team to keep things consistent. Still, Michlewitz expects some differences in spending priorities between the House and Senate.\"We're both under the understanding, and I think a lot of members are under the understanding, that time is of the essence related to this need to get this done in a relatively quick manner,\" Michlewitz said.",

Nothing much has changed.\"In the 160-member House of Representatives, it was close to a wash. Democrats defeated one incumbent Republican and filled one open seat now held by a retiring Republican. Across the aisle, Republicans filled one seat now held by a departing Democrat in an open race.Sen. Dean Tran (R-Fitchburg) lost to challenger John Cronin (D-Lunenburg) by just over half a percentage point, giving Senate Democrats a 37-to-3 advantage in the 40-member chamber. Tran's campaign was bogged down by an ethics investigation into his use of state staff to work for his reelection, which resulted in him being barred from his own State House office and direct contact with his staff.Democrat Kip Diggs, a former boxer, defeated Rep. William Crocker of Barnstable to reclaim the seat Crocker turned red in 2016.In North Attleboro, 24-year-old Democrat Adam Scanlon beat fellow Town Councilor John Simmons to capture a seat long-held by Republicans. Retiring Assistant House Minority Leader Elizabeth Porier has held the seat since 1999 and succeeded her husband who occupied it for decades before that.Ubertaccio said the successful Republican candidates kept their distance from Trump and relied on local connections to win.\"When you're losing a state as Trump did by between 20 and 30 points, it makes it very difficult for down-ballot partisans to win,\" Ubertaccio told GBH News. \"But the further down you go, the more likely voters are to think differently about the candidates. So they're simply less likely to view their hometown candidate as a smaller version of the national parties and they're more willing to differentiate.\" The GOP's single gain came in Western Mass. Republican Kelly Pease recaptured the Westfield-based House seat vacated by John Velis when Velis joined the Senate earlier this year.Republicans had thought they had scored another win in the western part of the state, but new vote tallies suggest the seat will remain in the Democratic column. In Ludlow, Republican James \"Chip\" Harrington had a slim lead over Democrat Jacob Oliveira to replace retiring Democrat Thomas Petrolati when the Associated Press first reported vote totals for the race. Both candidates said on social media Wednesday that local clerks were still counting ballots. According to newer totals, Democrat Oliveira holds a lead as the candidates consider legal action or a recount.",

[If] we see infection rates continue to climb to the point we have to shut [the city] down, we\u2019ll have to. But the intention right now is for everyone to take this virus seriously.\u201dWalsh urged every Bostonian to get tested for COVID-19. There are more than 30 testing sites in Boston, including several \u201cmobile\u201d testing sites offering free testing daily to anyone who wants it.Walsh also congratulated the city of Boston\u2019s Election Department and election staff \u2014 as well as election workers still counting votes across the country \u2014 for doing what he called an exemplary job of processing and counting votes.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing dedicated public servants and community members across this country, many of them volunteers, \u2026 they\u2019re working their hearts out to make sure that every single vote gets counted and that the will of the people will prevail,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI want to thank them, on behalf of all the people of Boston.\u201d ",

From being an activist with Partners for Youth with Disabilities, Black Lives Matter, and Boston\u2019s LGBTQ community, they\u2019re constantly seeking new ways to introduce intersectionality into their communities. A task that would be daunting for most is a task that fires them up. \u201cI have more work to do [there] because LGBT is very white centered \u2026 like, the reason why you have these rights is because of Black trans women and Black trans people who have [gone] in the front lines and helped us to get to where we're at\u2026 a lot of the times you sort of feel like you have to pick and choose. Like, should I talk about my Blackness or should I talk about being gay? It's not fair to have that Black person sort of pick and choose their identities instead of just having to talk about all of them. 'Cause it might be something to do with me being gay and me being Black and me being disabled. That's all important. That all goes into context.\u201dDespite their passion and motivation, it isn\u2019t always easy for Gonzalez to get out the door; living with ADHD, autism, chronic pain, anxiety and depression all threaten their activism work. Meet Zuleny GonzalezIt was their impaired mobility and executive function that led Gonzalez to pick the mail-in option for voting in this year's election. But the process didn\u2019t prove to be as easy as they had hoped.\u201cI put it in, [but] they sent me another [ballot] because I supposedly didn't sign it\u2026 I didn't know I had to sign it, so they sent it back,\" they said. Gonzalez did note, however, that they thought this was a far more accessible method for voting than going to the polls in person, which posed additional health and saefty concerns due to the pandemic.\u201cEspecially if someone's not able to make it physically to the polling place, that they're able to get [their ballot] in the mail and they're able to send it back. It just would have made sense even way before the pandemic happened,\" they said. They noted that in past elections, they weren't able to get to their polling site, but had no other option to vote. So they weren't able to vote at all.Gonzalez' learning difficulties also pose a challenge when it comes to quickly digesting the information on a ballot. While voters have the right to take 5-10 minutes in the voting booth, sometimes that\u2019s just not enough. \u201c[I need] someone to help me, like, wait, what does this mean? Or what does that mean? \u2026And sometimes I get it. Sometimes I don't. And if I don't get it, then I don't say anything, and I just put my name there because it's very confusing\u2026 like, the questions where they put it, how they phrase it, you don't understand. So, then you're second guessing yourself \u2014 [it\u2019s not] an easy yes or no question. So that's why I like [the mail-in option] where I get to sort of look through it while having the ballot in my hand\u2026 and sort of take the time to get through every single question [and think of] every single, like, personal feeling.\u201dVoting DifficultiesDespite the challenges of voting during the pandemic this year, Gonzalez remains hopeful \u2014 and fired up \u2014 for what lies beyond Election Day.\u201cTaking the fact that I'm one of the young people that's caring about what's going on in this country and want to make a difference, you know, whether it's voting, whether it's protesting, whether it's anything in between\u2026 there's actually young people that actually care\u2026 we actually want things to happen and [we\u2019re] not just going to sit around and wait until something happens.\u201dPhoto Credit: Mass Advocacy for Children",

      "body": "Two days after Election Day, and with the outcome of the presidential election still undecided, experts from across Massachusetts joined GBH News' Jim Braude, Margery Eagan, Joe Mathieu, and Arun Rath to discuss how the country might move forward in the weeks and months ahead.Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, fresh off a successful re-election campaign of his own, joined Braude and Eagan first and discussed this year's huge voter turnout among 18- to 34-year-olds, which he saw as a continuation of the local trend from this year's Democratic primary in Massachusetts. Since 2018, there was a 50% increase in votes from that demographic in Massachusetts.\"I think it is something that goes to how energized young people are about the issues of racial justice, climate crisis, the need for everyone to get health care,\" Markey said. \"There's a really engaged younger generation that we have not seen in recent political memory, and I don't think they're going away.\"Raw HtmlMarkey also discussed what could happen in the event that former Vice President Joe Biden wins the presidency, but is left with a Republican-controlled Senate, especially against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, ongoing political and social upheaval, and economic strain. Phillip Martin, GBH News senior investigative reporter, has been covering the ongoing social upheaval in Boston and beyond. He joined Mathieu to talk about what\u2019s happening in the nation's streets as demonstrators rally against voter suppression and the president\u2019s requests to stop vote counting. \u201cThe \u2018angry white man\u2019 has spoken \u2014 that\u2019s what this election is all about. A lot of that is about white grievance,\u201d Martin said, noting that the protests have been peaceful. \u201cThe streets are talking a lot louder than many members of Congress these days.\u201dRaw HtmlPeople have been taking to the streets to demand change for centuries in America, and Malia Lazu, an entrepreneur, founder of Mass VOTE and lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management, began the next panel discussion by invoking Dr. Martin Luther King and his ultimate goal of reconciliation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to figure out how to work toward and continue to lean in towards justice,\u201d she said.Raw HtmlLazu and fellow panelists went on to discuss the role of the news media and social media in creating and fostering political polarization. Dipayan Ghosh, a former advisor to President Barack Obama while in office and former Senator Hillary Clinton in her campaign for president, who now studies digital privacy and civil rights at Harvard University, noted that our society is experiencing a fundamental shift as technology changes how people communicate. He pointed to the prevalence of disinformation online, not only in English, but also in Spanish, as a deep concern. The technology may be new, but the human desire to connect is not, according to Gregory Fried, professor of political philosophy at Boston College. He explained a classic tenet of political philosophy, which holds that as political animals people need to \u201csee each other embodied,\u201d and that anonymity brings out the worst in society. He told Mathieu that disagreements can be constructive but people don\u2019t need to react every time, as is all too easy to do online.Raw HtmlLazu noted that the root of polarization is not just political disagreement; rather, it's steeped in \u2014 and upheld by \u2014 centuries of systemic racism. \u201cSomeone that looks like me shouldn\u2019t get shot in bed while sleeping. We need to make people\u2019s bodies and lives matter,\u201d she said, referring to the killing of Breonna Taylor in her home by police. And, referring to the video of the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the police that went viral, she added, \u201cit\u2019s not the news media \u2014 it\u2019s that 8:47 video.\u201dRaw HtmlSo, what's next? The panelists pointed to several areas for optimism in the weeks and months to come after the election is, finally, over. Although \u201cmovements take time,\u201d Lazu encouraged viewers to get creative about how they can keep their activism going in their own lives and communities; for example, by supporting minority businesses. Fried said that the enormous increase in turnout among young people in this year's election is the best way to reinvigorate the long-held American ideal of \u2018We The People.\u2019 Next up, WBZ-TV political analyst Jon Keller shared his thoughts on the biggest challenge facing the next president, as well as the American people: overcoming deep political and ideological divisions to once again unify as a country.Raw Html\"The challenge is always to transform a crowd into a community,\" Keller said, borrowing a line from a recent letter to the membership of the Archdiocese of Boston from Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley. \"Donald Trump has proven to be a master at drawing and exciting a crowd. But not so adept at creating a sense of community beyond his own narrow base. That's why he appears to be headed for defeat.\"\"The challenge for Joe Biden, if in fact he's the next president, and for the entire Congress, is going to be to figure out how to transform a crowd into some semblance of a community,\" Keller said.As the nation seeks moments of comfort amidst the uncertainty of the last few months, Porsha Olayiwola, the Poet Laureate of Boston, followed Keller with a powerful reading of her poem \u201cwhat is the suffrage movement to a blk womyn?: an anthem\" as a reflection on civic engagement.Raw HtmlHost Arun Rath concluded the conversation with a special edition of In It Together, in which he talked about the intersection of politics and the pandemic, including how the coronavirus has disproportionately impacted communities of color, and how to maintain self-care in times of heightened anxiety throughout the election, social unrest, and the pandemic. Guest Michael Curry, Deputy CEO and General Counsel of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, called the pandemic \"our national Katrina,\" likening the mismangement of the crisis, and resulting devastation, to the 2005 hurricane.Watch GBH News Presents - Election 2020: What's Next in its entirety here.",

The news was first reported by MLB Network's Jon Heyman and later confirmed by The Boston Globe. The team has not yet responded to a request from GBH News to confirm the hiring.Cora and the team parted ways after Cora's role in a sign stealing scandal as a coach for the Houston Astros in 2017 came to light. MLB suspended him for the 2020 season. The results of an MLB investigation into the Astros mentioned Cora multiple times and found that he helped Houston to develop ways to improperly steal signs and participated in their actions as the team's bench coach.Another investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by the Red Sox in 2018 cleared Cora of any involvement in that scandal.  After Cora left, Boston went 24 and 36 in the pandemic-shortened season under Ron Roenicke, finishing last in the AL East and missing the playoffs. Under Cora, the Red Sox went 192-132 in two seasons, including a franchise-best 108 regular season wins and winning the World Series in Cora's first season as manager in 2018.",

      "body": "State officials are committed to keeping the health care system open during a second surge of the coronavirus pandemic, the head of the Baker administration's COVID-19 command center said Friday.Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders, speaking during a webinar hosted by the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, said the state would work with hospitals, providers and insurers to \"engage in more nuanced planning in order to maintain access throughout the fall and winter.\"As COVID-19 cases first began to climb in Massachusetts, a March 15 order from Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel mandated that Massachusetts hospitals cancel non-essential elective procedures. Non-emergency procedures started to resume in May, as the state embarked on the earliest stages of its economic and social reopening after the initial surge peaked in mid-April.\"We've learned a lot from the spring,\" Sudders said. \"It's easy to shut things down. It's hard to reopen things and have people feel confident that it's safe, that they can go for health care services, non-COVID treatments and the like, and we have made a commitment to work with the hospital and health care industry on how to keep services and treatments, procedures open while we manage through COVID.\"That effort, Sudders said, involves \"a lot of data\" as hospital systems look at how to prioritize elective treatments in the event that COVID-19 hospitalizations and intensive care unit use spike. Unlike in the spring, she said, almost half of the people testing positive now are under age 40, and there has been less of a demand for ICU beds.\"We also saw some of the consequences of shutting things down in terms of people delaying treatment, and then when they were hospitalized it was for very, very serious conditions, so we're trying to find the balance here,\" she said.As of Thursday, there were 498 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the hospital, including 115 in the ICU, according to the Department of Public Health. For the two-week period from Oct. 18-31, the average age of hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 67.Over the course of the past week, the DPH has reported 8,957 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state's total confirmed caseload to 160,698. The seven-day average of new confirmed cases, at 918 on Nov. 4, is up 485 percent from its lowest-recorded value of 157.\"While the pandemic is far from over, and we are in our second surge in Massachusetts, I really do have confidence that our health care community and our communities as a whole will find the path forward,\" Sudders said. \"And while there is no playbook to a pandemic of this kind -- don't we all wish there was -- and we all can't wait for there to be a safe, effective and widely available vaccine, I have confidence that we will get through this challenging time together.\"The secretary said she and DPH officials met Thursday with representatives of the vaccine development project known as Operation Warp Speed and heard \"a couple of things that were encouraging.\"One, she said, is that governors and states will be allowed to determine which populations should have priority in the distribution of an eventual vaccine.\"That has not always been clear from the federal government, like who would decide that, authorities in a state,\" she said. \"As we know, the state's demographics in Massachusetts are very different than in other states.\"Sudders said Massachusetts officials also asked how the federal government plans to allocate vaccines to states, and said that Massachusetts favors \"a straight per capita allocation of vaccines.\"",

      "body": "The election of seven new female state representatives this week is poised to boost women's representation on Beacon Hill to a new high next session.Sixty-two women -- a dozen in the Senate and 50 in the House -- won their elections Tuesday, meaning that women are set to hold 31 percent of the Legislature's 200 seats when the new two-year term begins on Jan. 6, 2021.Counting turnover that's occurred through special elections, next year's ranks of women lawmakers will be five more than the previous record of 57 at the start of this session in 2019, and 10 more than 52 seats held by women in 2017.ModuleAccording to the Massachusetts Caucus of Women Legislators, a total of 213 women and more than 20,000 men have served in the Legislature. The first women elected to the Massachusetts House were Reps. Sylvia Donaldson of Brockton and Susan Fitzgerald of Jamaica Plain in 1923, and Sen. Sybil Holmes of Brookline was the first woman elected to the state Senate, 14 years later.Women make up 51.5 percent of the Massachusetts population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.No female incumbents lost their reelection bids this year, and one woman -- Lowell Democrat Vanna Howard -- unseated a male incumbent, Rep. David Nangle, in the September primary.The other six female representatives-elect, all Democrats, claimed open seats: Jessica Giannino of Revere, Erika Uyterhoeven of Somerville, Patricia Duffy of Holyoke, Brandy Fluker Oakley of Boston, Meg Kilcoyne of Northborough and Sally Kerans of Danvers.Kilcoyne will be the first woman to hold the 12th Worcester District seat, and Kerans is a former representative who served on Beacon Hill in the '90s. When Kerans began her first term in 1991, there were 38 women in the state Legislature.The House's party breakdown among women in the new term is set to be 44 Democrats, five Republicans (Reps. Kimberly Ferguson of Holden, Susan Gifford of Wareham, Sheila Harrington of Groton, Hannah Kane of Shrewsbury, and Alyson Sullivan of Abington) and one unenrolled lawmaker, Athol Rep. Susannah Whipps.In the Senate, all 12 women are Democrats who ran as incumbents, including Senate President Karen Spilka of Ashland. The last Republican woman to hold a state Senate seat in Massachusetts was Jo Ann Sprague of Walpole, who opted not to seek reelection in 2004.women_in_government2020electionSeventy-six women, mostly Democrats, ran for state legislative offices in Massachusetts this year, down from the 79 who ran in 2018, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.Women accounted for just over 29 percent of the country's 7,383 state legislators in 2020, the center's figures show, holding 521 seats in state senates and 1,641 in state houses of representatives or assemblies. Of the total 2,162 women legislators, 552 are women of color.Nevada had the highest percentage of female representation, at 54 percent, and West Virginia's 13.4 percent was the lowest, according to the center.Nationwide, 17 women, including Spilka, lead state senates, and seven women are state house speakers. Massachusetts has never had a female speaker, a post filled by a vote among representatives at the start of each session.The secretary of state's office has also never been held by a woman, and while Acting Gov. Jane Swift in 2001 became the first woman to serve as governor, Bay State voters have never elected a woman to the corner office. Women do hold several other prominent roles in Massachusetts government.Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito is one of four current female constitutional officers, along with Auditor Suzanne Bump, Treasurer Deborah Goldberg and Attorney General Maura Healey.In 1999, Margaret Marshall became the first woman to serve as chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, and another woman is on track to step into that post. Gov. Charlie Baker last month nominated Associate Justice Kimberly Budd to serve as the next chief justice, and if confirmed she will become the first Black woman to lead the state's highest court. Baker has nominated another woman, Appeals Court Judge Dalila Argaez Wendlandt. Aside from Budd, two other judges on the seven-seat SJC bench -- Elspeth Cypher and Barbara Lenk -- are women, and Lenk plans to retire next month.Ninety-five years after Edith Nourse Rogers began her term as the first woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, the state has a female senator, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and three of its nine members of Congress are women -- Reps. Katherine Clark, Ayanna Pressley and Lori Trahan.Clark, a Melrose Democrat, is vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, making her the second highest-ranking woman in the U.S. House after Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has said she intends to run for assistant speaker, which would move her up two rungs on the House leadership ladder and into the fourth position from the top after speaker, majority leader and whip.",

      "body": "Joe Biden won Massachusetts handily in the presidential election, but President Donald Trump did better than a lot of people were expecting in communities with large Latinx populations, including cities like Lawrence and New Bedford. GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath discussed the Latinx vote with UMass Boston Political Science Professor Luis Jim\u00e9nez, with the college's Gaston Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy Publications. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: I want to make sure that our framing of this is correct. Did Donald Trump really do dramatically better than Republicans traditionally have with Latinos in Massachusetts? Prof. Luis Jim\u00e9nez: I wouldn't say dramatically better, but yes. In what we call the Latino electorate, yes he did. But I want to point out that the numbers that we're talking about are relatively small. For instance, in Lawrence, which you mentioned, which is 80 percent Latino, he got 10 percent better. We're talking about 2,000 votes' difference. So he did better percentage-wise, absolutely, but these numbers are not huge.Rath: Even stipulating that it's not huge, were you surprised at all to see that?Jim\u00e9nez: I was. And I think a lot of the reason why people are surprised is because of this picture that we have with Donald Trump, where he started with anti-immigrant rhetoric, anti-Mexican rhetoric. He has made it a point to say things that seem to be very offensive to Latinos. I think that's part of the reason why we're so concerned, or why this narrative has come out. But I want to point out that I think for the Latinos that voted for him, because we are not a monolith \u2014 which you probably have been hearing a lot recently \u2014 some of these Latinos that are hearing this is to them, they're not part of, they don't consider themselves immigrants. And therefore, Trump saying anything about anti-immigration or anti-Latinos, they simply do not think he's talking about them. So I think that's part of the explanation. And the other explanation, too, is that there's an aspirational component to this, which is that people that might be Latino that do not think, again, that he's talking about them. Also, that they want to be American, and that's it. There's this narrative that they should be Cuban American or Mexican American, or whatever else. Rath: I want to bring this down even further. As you said, the Latin community is not a monolith. It's a really, it's kind of a difficult term to handle. It's like Asian American \u2014 we're talking about so many different countries of ethnic origin and many generations, as you're saying. Break it down as much as you can. Could you break down the communities, the genders, the age groups where the president may have done better compared to others? Jim\u00e9nez: The people that he did better with are Cubans and Venezuelans and Colombians. We know that from Florida. Also, I think, as I've looked at the data, he seems to have done better in Massachusetts with those people, too. The problem is those numbers are very small in Massachusetts. So he also did better \u2014 again, the numbers are small \u2014 but he did seem to be doing better with Dominicans in Puerto Rico. And the other reason why this might be, I think, it could be because of education. There seems to be an educational component to this. I think, because \u2014  just like with the rest of the electorate \u2014 there has been this division, very clear division in the Trump era, where college educated individuals tend to have gone for the Democrats. This seems to have happened to some extent with Latinos. Obviously not as dramatically, but there does seem to be some non-college Latinos who are moving in that direction. Rath: Even for people who are first generation immigrants, I mean, I know something that I've witnessed firsthand is that there could be a certain strain of conservatism for people who have chosen this country, right? This attitude of, even more my country, right or wrong. Is that something that you were seeing in some of these communities that may be turning more towards President Trump than they did four years ago? Jim\u00e9nez: Absolutely. People talk in the literature about assimilationist attitudes, and these assimilationist attitudes are basically what you just mentioned. People that, once they cross the bridge, if you will, feel a need to belong. One way to signal their belonging is to say, I'm going to support this person who is very \"America first\" and all of these things. And so it's a way to signal that kind of assimilationist idea. Rath: You were the coauthor of a report in September called The Latino Vote in Massachusetts. Talking more broadly along those lines, what were some of the major findings there? Jim\u00e9nez: The major findings are that Latinos as a group voted at a much higher rate than we had expected. For a long time, Latinos nationally and in Massachusetts had been voting at a lower rate, comparably speaking, to other groups \u2014 compared to whites, compared to Blacks. And so what we found is that this rate seems to have had an uptick in 2018. And I speculated in that, because we were trying to figure out why this might be, this was important, because if you recall in 2018, there were not particularly competitive races. And so people voted, I think, because there must have been some other reason. One of the reasons I think that made people mobilize is actually the Trump effect. I do think that people felt the need to express their rejection. And so this Trump effect, I think, has a mobilizing component on both sides. That is that Latinos are not a monolith. And so for some individuals, it mobilizes them because it makes them think, I am part of this group and I want to show people that the president is insulting me. And then at the same time, other people feel the opposite. Rath: That's a fascinating way to think about what we've just been talking about before that, which is that it sounds like more Latinos are voting, so if they're there and in larger numbers, a small shift like we were just talking about over national numbers could have a larger impact. Jim\u00e9nez: That's right. And one of the things I am really excited about is precisely that. Whatever happens, in this election, the Latino electorate showed up. We're talking about it right now because in Florida and Texas and so on, in Arizona and Nevada, they made a splash. So I'm hopeful that the political parties, both parties, will continue to consider them and try to mobilize them. Rath: What would you say that Democrats or Republicans, for that matter, need to do to maybe build on this if they want to improve their support in Massachusetts among Massachusetts Latinx communities? Jim\u00e9nez: This is a complicated question that I think we haven't figured out exactly, precisely because the Latino electorate is so diverse. But at the very minimum, what you need are people not just that might speak Spanish \u2014 although that's nice, but that's not the main thing \u2014 you need people that are Latino, that understand the communities, that come from their communities, that can speak to them and don't sound like they're coming from far away or don't understand the needs of the community. I think authenticity in some way is probably the most important variable, but getting that authenticity is difficult because the electorate is so diverse. So in my case, for instance, I am Mexican American. If I went to Florida, for instance, I don't think I would be able to communicate as effectively as I would maybe in Texas. That's difficult to maintain and difficult to reach. But the other thing that I think is important is also to have messages that appeal to them that are not insulting. And that's also hard to do because that comes off sometimes when people don't know the communities that they're talking to. There's a lot of debate about, for instance, about the term \"Latinx.\" Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego in Arizona said something about not using the term Latinx. It's complicated, because it's true that most people do not use that term. But for some individuals, that's important. And so again, we come back to this sort of balancing act where you're trying to appeal to a large group and you're not trying to offend, but you do sometimes \u2014 just because it's a very diverse electorate.",

      "body": "The streets of Boston erupted in demonstrations Saturday after former Vice President Joe Biden was declared winner of the 2020 presidential election after days of counting mail-in ballots in states around the country.President Donald Trump said Saturday he would not concede and would fight in court to overturn the results.In the shadow of the golden dome of the State House, the divisive election played out in competing demonstrations as a pro-Trump rally on the State House steps was met on the opposite side of the street by people reveling in Biden's victory. It was sometimes difficult to hear Daniel Herzberg, 32, who lives in Reading and grew up in Cambridge, as cars honked their horns and played music as they drove between the dueling demonstrations. But he was still ecstatic over the news of Biden's victory. \"Oh, it was incredible,\" he said. \"I mean, not surprising after the last three or four days, but still completely incredible.\"He said Trump's behavior and how it impacted the perception of America was his biggest issue was a voter. \"Economies rise and fall and diseases unfortunately come and go, but nothing can replace the reputation of the country,\" Herzberg said. \"And I don't know what's gonna happen with that, but something's gotta be done.\"AJ Jones, 42, of Dorchester, wore a Wu-Tang Clan mask at the celebration. He said he was stressed out before the news of Biden's victory was official, and he warned that Trump can still make moves to contest the results. \"We're not out of the woods yet. Trump's still threatening to tie things up in court and we're gonna have situations like this,\" he said gesturing to the pro-Trump gathering on the other side of Beacon Street. \"But, I feel relieved. And I feel more relieved that more...members of the GOP came out said, 'Hey, we're gonna go with the results.'\"Mwamba Malekani, 31, said that she's from outside of Boston. She displayed a shirt from Stacey Abrams campaign for governor of Georgia, which she worked on.She was especially excited because of Abrams' contributions to bring out Democratic voters in Georgia that has Biden clinging to a narrow lead in the state as the vote counting continues.\"I'm happy, she made Georgia blue,\" she said. Trump supporter Robert Scibilio of Scituate said Biden supporters were \"uneducated.\"\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of corruption with Joe Biden and his family,\" Scibilio said.  \u201cI understand why a lot of the vote in Massachusetts went to Biden. People here are very, very uneducated about the corruption in politics.\u201dBob Hartwell, 67, of Boston was on the Trump side and had a sign that expressed doubt that Biden could have gotten more votes than Trump. When asked if he accepted the news of Biden's victory, he responded \"hell no.\"The two gatherings were contentious at times, with people on each side sending jeers to the other side, and police gathered nearby.Other gatherings went on throughout the city, as people gathered in Copley Square, marchers paraded through Downtown Crossing, and celebrants filled streets in Jamaica Plain.In Somerville, dozens of people gathered in Davis Square, waving signs and flags and blaring music over a PA system.\u201cAs an immigrant you come here because things are supposed to better here,\" said Somerville's Wilson Wanene, who came to the U.S. from Kenya in 1978. \"The last four years were very long and very discouraging. I\u2019m just hoping, now praying, that we can begin to come back together again.\u201d City Councilor Michelle Wu and other local Democratic politicians issued celebratory statements.  \"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris winning this presidential election is just the first step,\" Wu said. \"Cities have a responsibility to use the momentum from this moment to deliver real, systemic change.\"Matt Baskin and Edgar B. Herwick III contributed to this report. Correction: This article has been updated to correct the year Wilson Wanene moved to the United States. It was 1978. ",

      "body": "Hundreds of people thronged downtown Boston on Saturday to celebrate the defeat of President Donald Trump. A rally on Copley Square, originally organized as a push for a full vote count, turned into a victory party once Joe Biden\u2019s win was announced. Among those marking Trump\u2019s loss was Jessica DeLuca of Waltham. DeLuca said she\u2019d never taken part in a demonstration before, and hadn\u2019t come to Boston with the aim of participating in this one. When she saw rally-goers marching down Boylston Street from Copley Square, she decided to join in.\u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d said DeLuca. \u201cI can\u2019t even put it into words. I\u2019m just happy that it\u2019s finally not Trump, honestly. The nightmare is over.\u201dGabby Solce was on her lunch break in Downton Crossing as marchers made their way by. Solce, who is queer, spoke through tears as she explained that Trump\u2019s loss and Biden\u2019s victory hits her on a personal level.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long four years,\u201d said Solce. \u201cI\u2019ve felt really marginalized, but I\u2019m really happy we\u2019re back in the conversation.\u201dThe peaceful and jubilant march ended in Post Office Square, where organizers addressed the crowd in English and Spanish, emphasizing that there was more work to be done to improve the lot of immigrants, people of color, workers, and others who say they\u2019ve felt targeted by the Trump administration. Half a mile away on Beacon Hill, a separate demonstration took a more confrontational tone. A small group of Trump supporters gathered in front of the State House and came face to face with a larger crowd reveling in Trump\u2019s loss. One of the president\u2019s backers, Robert Scibilio of Scituate, was surrounded by taunting Trump opponents. He responded with taunts of his own, at one point telling them, \u201cDon\u2019t reproduce.\u201d After leaving the scene, he lamented the election\u2019s outcome. \u201cNobody gives him [Trump] the respect or anything that he deserves,\u201d said Scibilio. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad. I feel like the country has failed me as a voter. I\u2019ll be moving as soon as I can to a Republican state.\u201d Other Trump supporters in the crowd echoed the president\u2019s false claims of electoral fraud. They were outnumbered by those who had come to mark the end of the Trump administration, including Madison Wilson of Boston. A Black woman, Wilson said she\u2019s optimistic about a White House led by Biden and Kamala Harris.\u201cIt just feels like our needs and wants for my community have been ignored,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cSpecifically Black Lives Matter, police brutality, the overwhelming unemployment in the Black community. I feel like all of that has been pretty much ignored during the Trump administration. I\u2019m hoping that the Biden and Kamala Harris administration will do better to voice our concerns and address them.\u201dGBH News' Esteban Bustillos contributed to this report.",

      "body": "Before she raised her microphone to speak, activist Monica Cannon-Grant began to cry tears of joy as a Beyonc\u00e9 song bounced off the sound chamber of buildings in Boston City Hall Plaza on Sunday afternoon. \u201cDo you know how important it is that there\u2019s a Brown skin girl in charge of this country?\u201d Cannon-Grant said to a crowd of more than 100 people gathered on the cobblestones. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is, something historic happened, and we can have the joy of that moment and also fight for accountability.\u201d Cannon-Grant organized Sunday's Black Lives Matter demonstration through her nonprofit, Violence in Boston, as a combination of protest and celebration in the wake of the presidential election. \u201cI'm going to say the part that's not attractive. I'm going to say the part where Kamala Harris has mass-incarcerated more Black men than anybody in that position. But that means we\u2019ve got to protest against them, it doesn\u2019t mean that the protest stops,\u201d Cannon-Grant continued. \u201cThat just means that now she's on the receiving end. We're going to pull up to the table and have a conversation.\u201d Tanisha Sullivan, the president of the Boston chapter of the NAACP, listed the names of Black women working on Democratic tickets around the country, including activist Stacey Abrams, who founded the Georgia Project and garnered votes for President-elect Joe Biden in her state; Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who was reelected to her position representing Massachusetts\u2019 7th Congressional District this week; and Chelsey Cartwright, a political director who has worked on campaigns for Pressley, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and now for Biden. \u201cI want to celebrate our democracy in this moment, congratulate all of us for participating in it and recognize that it didn't just happen,\u201d Sullivan told the crowd. \u201cA lot of people are talking about, you know, the magic. There's no magic to this. This is hard work, determination, strategic vision, execution and persistence.\u201d In the crowd, activists like Prema Bangera reflected on the significance of Harris\u2019 representation as a Black woman, while balancing what she said is the work yet to come on a long road ahead. \u201cKamala was my grandmother's name, and my grandmother is beloved to me,\u201d the 34-year-old Brighton resident said. \u201cI am grateful for the fact that she represents a change in history for so many young people, and I think it's a great change in general. But the Democratic party is still just holding capitalism and white supremacy in place, so it needs to be a larger shift in terms of the values that we need to set within this country.\u201d Cannon-Grant led protests throughout the summer in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, while calling for the reopening of local cases. One of those is the case of Terrence Coleman, a mentally ill Black man who was shot and killed by Boston Police in 2016. Tweet\u201cI critiqued Mayor Marty Walsh for 269 days. And then he sat down with me, and we began to work together, even when we don\u2019t agree,\u201d Cannon-Grant told GBH News. \u201cI think all politicians need to do that. Mayor Walsh knows that I'm going to do what I want to do regardless, and he can either agree or disagree, but we have a mutual respect for each other when it comes to protecting and advocating for the people of the city of Boston.\u201d Cannon-Grant was more critical of Gov. Charlie Baker, who authorized financial bonuses to police officers who choose to undergo sensitivity training in a bill filed last June. \u201cIn regards to Governor Baker, I think he needs to be ousted, quite honestly,\u201d Cannon-Grant told GBH News. \u201cTo make a decision to give a police department more money at a time when we're saying give money to organizations and activists who are doing the violence prevention work on the ground, is a clear indicator [of] where he stands and how he feels.\u201d Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu, who announced her bid for mayor in September, brought her two young children to the demonstration. \u201cThis is a reminder that the challenges and the crises that communities, particularly Black and Brown communities in Boston and beyond, have been facing were deep and were already at crisis level, way before COVID-19 and way before Donald Trump became president,\u201d Wu told GBH News. \u201cThis is about digging in and saying, we're going to use every bit of power that we have at the city level in this moment to rise up to that challenge and finally reimagine and transform systems.\u201d Tanisha Sullivan encouraged the crowd to pay attention to local issues and systems that have been transformed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a historic voter turnout number across Massachusetts. \u201cWe've got work to do to make sure that the COVID-19 electoral reforms that were put in place do not expire on Dec. 31, 2020. They need to be here to stay,\u201d Sullivan told the crowd. \u201cThat is mail-in balloting, extended opportunity for early voting. \u2026 We've got work to do to make sure that our democracy continues to work for all of us.\u201d TweetThough Sunday's crowd was smaller than some of the celebrations from the day prior, following the news of Biden\u2019s election, activist Ashawn Dabney-Small encouraged the group to continue marching and demonstrating. \u201cIf you can come out and support Biden winning his election, then you can come out and support Black and Brown bodies that have been killed every single day,\u201d Dabney-Small said. The 18-year-old activist and City Council candidate began to cry as he shared the story of his cousin, Anthony Smalls, who was shot by unknown assailants in 2014. \u201cTo this day, no one knows who shot him. There was no evidence found, the gun happened to disappear. And his life mattered,\u201d Dabney-Small said. \u201cHe had four kids, my cousins. He had a wife, a loving family, and his life was just taken in an instant. When are we going to acknowledge that everybody's life matters? Until we can acknowledge that, we are not going to move forward. It has been 400 years, and Black people are still dying.\u201d Daunasia Yancey, a 28-year-old organizer from Black Lives Matter Boston, said she arrived late to the protest after a AAA agent told her that her tires had been slashed. \u201cThe war continues, and the sore losers are going to do sore loser s**t, and are going to be sore losers,\u201d Yancey told the crowd. \u201cThey\u2019re going to continue to harass and threaten us, and we\u2019re not going anywhere. It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s in that house, because we built it, and until it truly belongs to the people, we\u2019re going to continue protesting.\u201dCorrection: An earlier version of this article stated that Sunday's protest was in collaboration with Black Lives Matter Boston. Though a speaker from BLM Boston contributed comment, the event itself was held independently by Violence in Boston.",

      "body": "The MBTA says it is facing a $579 million deficit next fiscal year due to the pandemic and will have to cut costs by sharply reducing subway, commuter rail, bus and ferry service.In plans released Monday, the transit agency detailed the services it proposes to reduce or eliminate. According to the proposal, the MBTA would retain 85 percent of its bus service. Fourteen routes would be consolidated, five routes would be shortened, and 25 routes \u2014 those that have the least ridership \u2014 would be eliminated. The agency proposes cutting 30 percent of subway service, leading to longer wait times between trains and no service after midnight. The commuter rail would be cut by 35 percent and weekend service would be eliminated. Ferry service \u2014 including the Hingham-Hull and Charlestown ferries \u2014 would be gone entirely. Ninety-nine percent of trips provided by The RIDE, which serves elderly and disabled passengers, would be retained.While some service changes on the commuter rail and ferry could take place as early as January, the agency has proposed implementing these changes to rapid transit service in March and to bus service this summer. There are no fare increases being proposed to increase revenue.See the full plan from the MBTA:Raw HtmlThe MBTA says it will reassess service levels for the subway and bus every three months, and for the commuter rail and ferry every six months, and if ridership or available funding increases, some service may be restored. MBTA officials say passengers' return will depend on the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine, the future of local travel and the speed of economic recovery. But Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack said at a press conference Monday that she doesn\u2019t expect ridership to return to pre-pandemic levels until at least the summer of 2022. Transit advocates want the MBTA to delay decisions about altering service. They warn that cutting service would mean some riders may never come back and are pushing for more state and federal funding to pick up the slack. But the MBTA insists it must start planning cutbacks now to reflect current demand and to conserve as much funding as possible so it can restore service when conditions warrant. General Manager Steve Poftak said in a statement that MBTA ridership dropped by more than 80 percent in March and \"has been slow to recover.\" A final decision on cuts will be made by the Fiscal Management and Control Board next month, following a series of virtual public hearings.",

      "body": "Although Joe Biden has won the presidency, the election was also a national referendum on police brutality, brought to the forefront by the summer\u2019s protests over George Floyd\u2019s death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. The outcome on that issue is less clear.At least 70 million Americans voted for Black Lives Don't Matter and the Proud Boys. I was shocked that President Donald Trump actually gained 5 million more votes than he did in 2016, but as a Black man who grew up near Ferguson and elsewhere in the South, I shouldn't have been. Selling white supremacy has been a hit in American politics since 1787, starting with the three-fifths clause in the Constitution. While voters defeated Trump at the polls, Trumpism remains undefeated.How does the country find common ground going forward? How are the advocates of police reform supposed to reach half of the electorate who refuse to recognize George Floyd's humanity?They can't.Fortunately, the movement to reform district attorneys\u2019 offices nationwide, spawned in the aftermath of the Ferguson riots six years ago, has gained enough momentum to enact change despite the prospect of a closely divided Congress and the lingering bitterness of some Trump voters. From Wesley Bell in St. Louis County, to Philadelphia\u2019s Larry Krasner, to Suffolk County\u2019s own Rachael Rollins, these reform-minded prosecuting attorneys have been making a difference in reducing the over-incarceration and over-policing of minority communities, from eliminating cash bail and reducing charges for nonviolent offenses.At the same time, the movement to \u201cDefund the police\u201d that urges cities to shift more of their budget into mental health and other resources instead of law enforcement, continues across the nation. Voters in Los Angeles on Tuesday voted to shift 10% of the city\u2019s $8.8 billion budget towards minority job training and mental health services instead of the LAPD. In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh has reallocated $12 million of the Boston Police\u2019s 2021 budget towards mental health and other social services, although Boston City Councilor and mayoral candidate Andrea Campbell pushed for more, around $60 million. Walsh recently also adopted all of his Boston Police Task Force\u2019s reform recommendations, which included a new civilian review board with subpoena powers and the authority to investigate instances of police misconduct on its own.While the literal meaning of \u201cDefund the police\u201d is controversial, support for what it actually entails \u2014 putting an end to police brutality \u2014 isn\u2019t. A Gallup Poll in July found that 58% of Americans said policing needs \u201cmajor changes.\u201d So the trend of shifting city resources away from the police will continue. It has already become a campaign theme heading into Boston\u2019s mayoral race next year.As the public health president, President-elect Joe Biden will still have a role to play in reforming local police. Police killings of Black men is a public health crisis that should be tackled with the same energy his administration plans to tackle the COVID-19 epidemic. According to a Northwestern University study last year, one in 1,000 Black men can be expected to be killed at the hands of the police, while an American Public Media Research Lab shows that COVID-19 has a mortality rate of 1 in 920 Black Americans as of last month. Biden and his public health experts should act swiftly to stem the twin pandemics ravaging Black communities nationwide.Although Biden may not have the help of a unified Congress for the next two years to pass federal legislation on police reform, such as eliminating qualified immunity, there is hope on the horizon.The election showed the organizing power of Black women in expanding the electorate and increasing turnout. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams led the way in flipping her state blue for the presidency for the first time since 1992, and her organizing efforts may pay off again in her state\u2019s Senate runoff elections in January. Locally, Massachusetts U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley also used her election cycle to organize and register new voters in Roxbury, a development that could impact the mayoral race and help elect Boston\u2019s first woman and person of color in history.While the election unfortunately didn\u2019t result in the \u201cBlue Wave\u201d that many activists had hoped could accelerate change, the work continues.Chip Goines, who was born near Ferguson, Mo., is a Boston-based community writer and activist.

      "body": "At least 140 incarcerated people have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Norfolk, Mass., \u2014 about 11% of the population at the medium security facility that houses some of the state\u2019s oldest and sickest inmates.Two prisoners have been sent to a nearby hospital for care and are said to be in stable condition, state officials said Monday.The news is prompting concern among prisoners advocates and family members, not just because of the outbreak \u2014 a potential sign of a second wave in the state\u2019s prison system \u2014 but because the population at Norfolk is likely more at risk of COVID-related complications.\u201cWe are very worried about folks who are particularly vulnerable to succumbing to COVID,\u201d Elizabeth Matos, executive director of the Boston-based nonprofit Prisoners' Legal Services, told GBH News. \u201cThis is by definition disproportionately a population that suffers from chronic care issues like diabetes and heart conditions, Hepatitis C, HIV.\u201dMCI-Norfolk houses a 20-bed unit for some of the state\u2019s most ailing prisoners, called the Critical Stabilization Unit. Nearly 21% of the entire prison population is 60 years old or older, according to state data, compared to about 12% systemwide. Department of Correction officials say they ordered facility-wide testing at Norfolk last week after learning about two positive tests; results of 300 tests are still pending. So far, none of the positive cases were housed in the Critical Stabilization Unit, prison officials say.Since the beginning of the pandemic earlier this year, eight state prisoners have died of COVID-related illnesses and at least 540 incarcerated people of about 6,800 have tested positive across the system, according to data made available by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. This number does not include all new cases in Norfolk. The state also is reporting 19 new positive cases at the minimum security prison at MCI-Shirley after a positive case prompted the testing of all 196 incarcerated people there. There\u2019s also one active case at MCI-Cedar Junction, prison officials say.Prisoners advocates have been pushing to reduce the prison population to allow for more social distancing behind bars and say not enough is being done. The recent outbreak is a troubling change from late September, when active cases dropped to zero and the state started to loosen restrictions, including allowing visitors to most facilities.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Norfolk is the unfortunate and foreseeable result of not releasing people \u2014 via parole or home confinement \u2014 and inconsistent testing,\u201d said Anthony Benedetti, chief counsel of the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the state\u2019s public defender\u2019s office.Dirk Greineder, who is currently incarcerated at MCI-Norfolk, wrote GBH News in an email dated Friday that prisoners aren\u2019t being provided official information about what is going on. Greineder is a former Wellesley doctor convicted of killing his wife in 1999. He writes a blog for a website called the RealCostofPrisons.org and says the prison remains crowded with no ability to social distance.\u201cWe really need intervention from outside to oversee that best practices are implemented,'' he wrote to GBH News,  \"and that those that get sick are adequately cared for in the midst of this rampant confusion.\" ",

      "body": "President Donald Trump is launching a series of lawsuits in the country's battleground states contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University law professor and GBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed to make sense of the various lawsuits. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: So before we dive into these assorted lawsuits that the president and his surrogates have filed, he promised that an avalanche of new ones would be filed yesterday. Rudy Giuliani told us this was coming. Did the avalanche fall on you? Daniel Medwed: Well, like so many things related to our president, it was really much ado about nothing. Marc Elias, a voting rights lawyer for Biden [and] a major lawyer in the country, tweeted yesterday that there were \"a few stragglers, but nothing significant.\" And I think the relative litigation silence here speaks volumes. Yes, there are a lot of cases pending, but many are on the verge of being dismissed and the others are very unlikely to shift the vote tallies in any meaningful way. Mathieu: This has been described as a kitchen sink kind of approach \u2014 we're just throwing everything at the wall to see if anything sticks. How would you characterize the president's overall legal strategy, if there is one? Medwed: I don't think there's a strategy, and I think the kitchen sink description is very apt. It's like the love child between Jackson Pollock and Judge Judy, right? It's a complete abstract and bizarre legal strategy. Mathieu: I'm trying to picture this.Medwed: I guess if I had to categorize these lawsuits and impose structure on the disorder, I guess I could try. So one category relates to lawsuits about access to observe the vote counting process \u2014 that Trump's team should be able to watch what's going on. A second bucket of cases targets mail-in ballots in particular, focusing on the timing of their receipt and the manner in which they're processed. And a final grouping, I think, and it's a very broad one, relates to claims of lax safeguards in states that purportedly allow voter fraud to flourish. Unsurprisingly, a lot of these litigation efforts focus on Pennsylvania.Mathieu: Pennsylvania. Battleground Pennsylvania. 20 electoral votes. I guess it's no surprise that this is where this battle is being waged. Medwed: I think that's right, and there are lots of different cases there. I think there are seven active ones, maybe even more. Just late last night, the Trump team filed an additional one with a lot of fanfare from their campaign, at least about how Pennsylvania allegedly has a two-tiered approach to counting votes [and] treats mail-in votes differently from in-person votes, supposedly. In addition, there have been multiple lawsuits about gaining Republican access to observe the vote tabulation process in Philadelphia. Even though Pennsylvania has complied with those requests, including a state court order, the Trump team was unfazed [and] filed another lawsuit in federal court, which they lost. Also, there was a major suit that got a lot of attention and culminated in an order from Justice Samuel Alito demanding that the secretary of state of Pennsylvania separate the mail in ballots into two categories: those that were received by Election Day and those that were postmarked and received up until Friday of last week. The state Supreme Court had said that that latter process was OK \u2014 that voters could submit their mail-in ballots, mail them by Election Day as long as they were received by Friday. The Trump team touted this as a big victory [and] that Justice Alito had held Pennsylvania to account, but it was really a Pyrrhic one, and here's why. The secretary of state of Pennsylvania was already doing this. She had already ordered poll workers to separate these ballots in the event of election litigation. And what's more, very few votes were at stake. Very few ballots fell into that latter category. Mathieu: OK, so with all of this said, then, everything you've told us this morning, Daniel, could this lawsuit \u2014 Pennsylvania [or] any of them \u2014 go to the Supreme Court, as the president has said? Medwed: I don't think so, and here's why. The gap is just too wide and the number of states in play too diffuse for that to happen. So for Trump to prevail and get to the Supreme Court in any meaningful way and gain enough electoral votes before the states certify them in December and they go to Congress in January, he'd have to raise concerns about the voting process in multiple states and with thousands and thousands of votes at stake \u2014 far more than what occurred in 2000. What made 2000 so outcome determinative [in] the Supreme Court decision in Bush versus Gore is this dispute boiled down to one state, Florida, and only about 530 votes separated the two candidates here. You've got 147,000 in Michigan, 45,000 in Pennsylvania, 36,000 in Nevada and I could go on to talk about Wisconsin, Arizona and Georgia. Just too many states in play [and] too many cases. I don't see how the Supreme Court affects the outcome. ",

      "body": "When Major League Baseball suspended Alex Cora for the 2020 season for his role in a cheating scandal with the Houston Astros back in January, the last thing that was on his mind was coming back as manager of the Boston Red Sox. \"I knew I wanted to come back to the game, but I didn't know how fast, you know. ... Little by little, [my family] understood that probably not this year, but probably in two years or three years, something was gonna open up and there was a chance to get back to the game,\" Cora told reporters during a reintroductory press conference Tuesday. \"But, you know, honestly, like I said before, so soon? You know, I never saw it.\"Speaking at home plate of Fenway Park next to Sox President and CEO Sam Kennedy, Chief Baseball Officer Chaim Bloom and General Mananger Brian O\u2019Halloran, the prodigal manager was living out something he admits he didn't think would happen. But he made sure to hit all the right notes of a sports mea culpa, apologizing to everyone from his family to the organization. \"I want to make sure that everybody knows that this situation is part of who I am, you know, for the rest of my career,\" Cora said. \"As a man, I have to deal with it. I don't want people to make it seem like it's a great comeback story. I don't want that.\"Cora didn't get into details about what happened in 2017 with the Astros, but he publicly apologized multiple times for what happened. And he acknowledged that he might get hate for his actions, much like Houston did at the beginning of this past season. \"It's something that if I didn't feel that, on a personal level, if I didn't feel prepared for what's coming, I probably would have declined the phone call or text,\" he said. \"I'd say, 'You know what, Chaim, I'm not ready for this. Thank you, but no thanks.' I know it's gonna be tough in certain places, but I understand.\"Bloom said that when he was getting ready to speak to Cora about the possibility of bringing him back, that he wanted to be as thorough as possible. \"Not just for determing his fit as a manager, but also because this is a big deal what happened,\" he said. \"And it was an event that, it took its toll on all of us. Obviously, Alex has described that with respect with himself, but we all went through something. And there was a lot to process.\"There are a lot of hot takes about what Cora did, and how baseball should feel about him being back in Boston. This much is indisputable: Cora played a key role in one of the biggest scandals that has ever rocked the game. But he also publicly faced a humbling punishment from MLB, served a season in exile and has seemingly said and done everything right since then. In pro sports, the single metric that is valued over everything else, no matter what anyone says, is winning. And under Cora, the Red Sox won a lot \u2014 at least in that 2018 season. And after the Sox finished in dead last in the AL East in 2020, winning is in especially high demand in Boston. But coaches and managers have some of the most fickle job security in sports. And so while Cora may be on his best behavior and the Red Sox tout their faith in him and the lessons he's learned, it can't be ignored that they brought him back because they believe he can help them win more games. And if that doesn't happen, don't be surprised if Cora finds himself packing up his belongings at Fenway Park one more time. ",

      "body": "Massachusetts U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley on Tuesday called on Gov. Charlie Baker to release inmates from state jails and prisons struggling with a recent outbreak of COVID-19. \"The governor alone, with the stroke of a pen, has the power to pardon or commute the sentences of thousands of medically vulnerable people behind the wall and to reunite them with their families, drastically reducing the population and crowding of our prisons and jails and slowing the spread of COVID-19 in these facilities,\" Pressley said. \"Now is not the time for half measures of virtue signaling.\" Pressley was joined at a press conference outside the State House by Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins, State Sen. Becca Rausch, Carlene Pavlos of the Massachusetts Public Health Association, Dr. Monik Jim\u00e9nez of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Elizabeth Matos of Prisoners\u2019 Legal Services. They are seeking the \u201cdecarceration\u201d of hundreds of inmates who they say, \u201ccannot socially distance or otherwise protect themselves.\u201d The Department of Corrections said Tuesday that 172 prisoners at Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Norfolk have tested positive for the coronavirus \u2014 up from 140 people on Monday. Three people are now being cared for at nearby hospitals. Other institutions have experienced similar spikes in infection, including 137 prisoners at the Middleton Jail and House of Correction.The governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Criminal defense attorney Lisa Newman-Polk said she is concerned about the health of a client at MCI-Norfolk who has health issues that make him susceptible to the disease. She released an affidavit that she says is being filed Tuesday to the Massachusetts Parole Board in hopes of expediting the release of the client, whom she declined to identify. \u201cHe is a highly medically compromised person who I have serious concerns could become gravely ill or die if he contracts this disease,\u2019\u2019 she said. In the affidavit, Newman-Polk says she has two other clients at Norfolk who already have tested positive for the disease.She says sick prisoners are being moved to quarantine units that hold approximately 80 people, sharing three toilets and three urinals. \u201cThe units are filthy with dust everywhere,\u2019\u2019 the affidavit says. \u201cThe quarantined prisoners who are well enough are doing what they can to clean the units; however, they have not been provided proper cleaning supplies.\u201d Department of Correction officials could not immediately be reached for comment on her allegations.Locked in on four sides in tiny spaces, inmates nationwide have experienced a disproportionate rate of infections. But official responses have differed state by state. New Jersey released over 2,000 incarcerated people in response to COVID-19 just last week, and California officials recently ordered the release of more than 8,000 people. Far fewer who have been diagnosed with the virus have been released in Massachusetts. Eight state prisoners have died of COVID-related illnesses and an estimated 540 people behind bars have tested positive, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. Jimenez, who said her father spent his lifetime behind bars, said the rate of infection of people incarcerated in Massachusetts facilities is three times higher than that of the general population, and nearly five times higher than that of the country. \u201cIt is critical to know that all of this data is an underestimate,\u201d she said. Rollins explained that COVID-vulnerable men and women in Massachusetts must pass three criteria to eligible for release. They must \"prove that they either have an underlying comorbidity or a factor that makes them more susceptible to COVID,\" she said, as well as have a colorable claim and an entry plan back into the community. But Rollins said poverty could make the latter qualification difficult for some to achieve. \"We are now penalizing poverty, and people that might not have a home to return to or family to return to,\" she said. \"So if you are a white collar criminal and you want to return back to Wellesley, it's likely that you're going to have a place to go. But if you are a convicted felon and want to return back to your mother's home, who is on Section 8 [housing], there might be hurdles you have to clear in order to do that.\" There must be exceptions, Rollins said. \u201cEven if somebody might not be eligible for release, we don't believe they should die in a correctional facility under the watch of Secretary Turko and Governor Baker,\" she said. \"We have to be better with respect to what they are doing.\u201d ",

      "body": "As the coronavirus pandemic surges in Massachusetts once again \u2014 with the state recently surpassing the grim milestone of 10,000 deaths due to COVID-19 \u2014 Gov. Baker says that he wants kids back in the classroom, with students returning to school at least partly in-person and the goal of a full-time return. It's been since last March, when the pandemic caused lockdowns across the region, that some of the state's largest school systems, including Boston, saw full-time attendance in public schools. Superintendent of Boston Public Schools Brenda Cassellius joined host Joe Mathieu on Morning Edition to discuss the state of BPS heading into this winter.Cassellius began by describing the timeline for a return to school, with the highest risk students returning to in-person learning first. \"We're looking to return our first group of students, that's job No. 1, for about two hundred of our very highest needs kids, on Monday, so we're very excited to welcome them,\" she said. Watch: Boston's Latest Plan For Students' Return To The ClassroomRaw HtmlThe next group to return to school, according to Cassellius, will include an expanded list of students who have disabilities, are still learning English, are experiencing homelessness, or are otherwise engaged by the Department of Children, Youth, and Families. \"We want to make sure that we're able to open there,\" she said.The remaining students, including the youngest grades, would return to schools in-person last. \"As soon as we see a trend of [the virus] coming down, I would say probably sometime after Thanksgiving, would be when we would hopefully have this under control to be able to start welcoming our students back,\" Cassellius said. \"But that's not assured, of course, because [the virus] is surging across the entire nation and we need to watch those numbers and make sure that it's safe.\"In anticipation of students returning to in-person learning, BPS has been testing the air quality in its schools as well as upgrading the safety of their facilities. When asked if she feels the schools are ready and safe for children to return, Cassellius said, \"We do. We feel that they were ready and they are ready for students. But we are taking some additional measures.\"ModuleCassellius on air quality",

Baker to name an interim appointee from the same party as the out-going senator, meaning that Sen. Elizabeth Warren would be replaced by another Democrat should she resign to join the Biden administration.\"The legislation is at its essence, is saying we're going to make sure that the party of the person is the same party as who the voters put in there in the first place,\" Domb told GBH News.In the last two decades, the law has been changed by the Democrat-controlled legislature a handful of times to make sure Republican governors can't name a Republican senator, and then changed back or altered when a Democrat sits in the corner office.\"I don't deny that actually it is partisan, because I believe that the voters in Massachusetts make partisan choices,\" Domb said of her amendment.Former interim U.S. Senator Mo Cowan was the beneficiary of the current law, which lets the governor name any placeholder until a special election.\"It's important to make sure that folks across the Commonwealth have the full complement [of] representation in the congressional delegation, particularly at the beginning of an administration,\" Cowan told GBH News.\"I think it would be helpful to have two senators in the chamber. Clearly, there's going to be a lot of work, important work, that the new administration is going to want to focus on,\" Cowan said.Whether Warren is even being vetted by the Biden team is unclear, since the senator, a former presidential candiate who campaigned on Medicare for All and reigning in private equity firms, might have a difficult confirmation a Republican-controlled Senate.Massachusetts House Democrats will weigh in on the proactive change Thursday or Friday during their annual budget debate.",

      "body": "Thursday\u2019s election for Massachusetts Democratic Party chair might seem, from the outside, like an esoteric bit of political theater. But it\u2019s actually a window into a bigger debate over the national party\u2019s future in the wake of the 2020 election \u2014 and a referendum on an ugly local controversy that\u2019s still roiling the party.The incumbent chair of the Mass. Dems, Gus Bickford, wants to keep his job. As he tells it, the party has thrived under his leadership since his election in 2016. \u201cThis election cycle, and the election cycle two years ago \u2026 we\u2019ve had a tremendous amount of success,\u201d Bickford, a longtime Democratic operative who\u2019s worked for Elizabeth Warren, Niki Tsongas and Martha Coakley, told GBH News.\u201cWe\u2019ve flipped nine [state legislative] seats from red to blue,\u201d Bickford said. \"We\u2019ve won all the special elections this year. We have continued to keep a completely Democratic congressional delegation, kept our U.S. senators in office.\u201dModuleBickford\u2019s two challengers \u2014 former gubernatorial candidate Bob Massie and Mike Lake, who ran for lieutenant governor in 2014 \u2014 have a very different take.As Massie seeks the chair\u2019s job, he\u2019s circulating a 30-plus-page document that describes his vision for the party and critiques Bickford\u2019s leadership. In it, Massie notes that the number of registered Democrats in Massachusetts continues to decline; right now, Massie observes, Democrats comprise the same share of the electorate in Arizona as here.Massie\u2019s manifesto also laments that legislation embodying the values articulated in the state party\u2019s platform continues to languish on Beacon Hill, including police reform and a bill to extend the state\u2019s COVID-era eviction moratorium. The problem, Massie contends, is that the state party focuses too much on getting Democrats elected \u2014 and not enough on pushing them to do the right thing once they are in office.\u201cAt one level, the Massachusetts Democratic Party is dominant,\u201d Massie said in an interview with GBH News. \u201cWe control 80 percent of the positions in the State House, in the House itself, and then 90 percent in the Senate. Our entire congressional delegation is Democratic, and two-thirds of our constitutional offices are Democratic.\u201dAnd yet, Massie added, \u201cWhether it is economic disparities, or racial injustice, or the breakdown of our educational or healthcare or housing systems under the pressure of COVID or climate change under the impact of COVID or climate change \u2014 these are areas that the Democratic Party has in its platform that are not being fully implemented, or even advocated for in effectively in the state. And I\u2019d like to fix that.\u201d The shift Massie envisions would effectively push the Massachusetts Democratic Party further to the left, as some national Democrats attribute the party\u2019s weaker-than-expected showing in the 2020 elections to an embrace of overly progressive positions and messaging.Other Democrats question this diagnosis, however, and contend that a commitment to ambitious goals like Medicare For All is the party\u2019s best path forward, both in principle and politically.Lake, Bickford\u2019s other challenger, also notes the decline in Democratic registration in Massachusetts \u2014 and argues the party is failing to effectively court the very people whose values naturally align with it.Nationally, Lake said, the past four years have seen \u201chistoric levels of activism \u2026 from an inauguration that had less attendees than protesters to the Black Lives Matter movement, which is now the largest protest movement in American history.\u201cThese folks who are protesting share our values,\" he continued. \"And yet, in the same four-year period of time, Massachusetts has seen 50,000 fewer registered Democrats.\u201dLake also says Democrats need to do a better job making their case to communities they\u2019ve tended to take for granted, including white working-class men and communities of color. And he cites the controversy that erupted in this year\u2019s First District Democratic Congressional Primary as more evidence of the need for change.In that race, challenger Alex Morse, the mayor of Holyoke, was accused of inappropriate behavior with college students \u2014 and the state party was accused of inappropriately responding to those allegations in a way that boosted incumbent Richard Neal.A recent independent report on the episode, conducted by former State Sen. Cheryl Jacques, found that complaints about Morse's conduct had circulated for two to three years, and that some allegations about the party\u2019s conduct were unfounded.But the report also concluded that Bickford violated a state party bylaw by encouraging the College Democrats of Massachusetts, who had raised concerns about Morse\u2019s behavior, to speak with a reporter prior to the primary election \u2014 thereby participating in a contested primary instead of remaining neutral.\u201cWe need leadership that can be trusted, that restores the integrity of the party,\u201d Lake said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t do that when the party is under investigation, or in the midst of a scandal and a cover up.\u201dBickford, for his part, says the report shows the party urgently needs an official protocol to address such complaints in the future and insists that he acted with no ill intent. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more sorry for the pain that that has caused, in the LGBTQIA+ community and to Democrats across the state,\u201d Bickford said. \u201cAnd I think because I know what has happened, I can help rebuild that trust.\u201dAnother point of contention in tonight\u2019s election: whether the Democrats have done enough to push back against Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican who was easily re-elected in 2018 and is more popular among Democrats than among members of his own party.Bickford says he\u2019s built up the party\u2019s fundraising base over the past four years, and that whoever the Democratic gubernatorial nominee is in 2022 will have more financial and organizational assets at their disposal than former nominee Jay Gonzalez did in 2018. Massie believes Democrats need to highlight Baker\u2019s preference for incremental management rather than big, structural change \u2014 and that the appetite for that critique will be greater in 2022 than it was in 2018, thanks to Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory and other shifts in the political landscape.\u201cAs one major political said to me not that long ago \u2026 Gov. Baker has a great deal of political capital, and he refuses to spend any of it on anything of lasting significance,\u201d Massie said.Lake, for his part, believes Democrats just aren\u2019t doing enough to contrast their vision with Baker\u2019s.\u201cWe have a very different vision of what Massachusetts can and should be, but we\u2019re not talking about that. ... So we\u2019re not giving people an option, a choice \u2014 we\u2019re not helping them to see the alternative,\" he said. \u201cWhen we start standing up, that\u2019s when we can expect people to be standing with us.\u201dThe Massachusetts Democratic State Committee will elect its chair Thursday evening.

      "body": "Mayor Marty Walsh announced Thursday that he\u2019s taking multiple steps to reform the Boston Police Department, including filing an ordinance to create a new Office of Police Accountability and Transparency and signing executive orders to create a new Civilian Review Board and Internal Affairs Oversight Panel.  Those steps were not unexpected. As Walsh noted in a press conference, he\u2019s acting on recommendations made by the Boston Police Reform Task Force, which the mayor created amid a massive nationwide push for police reform earlier this year. They are, however, a sign that the mayor \u2014 who may seek re-election next year \u2014 intends to act on his commitments in this area. \u201cOur goal is to sustain the urgency of the moment,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cTo achieve deep and meaningful change here in Boston. To create a national model for breaking down systemic racism collaboratively, with the community, in ways that improve public safety for all.\u201d Walsh announced the formation of the task force in June, and revamped its structure in July. It issued its final recommendations in October, after holding five separate listening sessions around the city. ModuleThe new entities announced by Walsh would work as part of a cohesive whole, with the Office of Police Accountability and Transparency funneling cases to the Civilian Review Board and Internal Affairs Oversight Panel and providing research and administrative support as they do their work. The task force proposed that the Internal Affairs Oversight Panel consist of professionals charged with reviewing the BPD\u2019s internal-affairs investigations; that the Civilian Review Board consist of residents charged with reviewing allegations against the police and advising the mayor and BPD on policy; and that subpoena power be given to a three-person commission consisting of the executive director of OPAT and the chairs of the oversight panel and review board. The Civilian Review Board announced by Walsh Thursday will have nine members, nominated both by the mayor\u2019s office and the Boston City Council. It was not immediately clear how the nomination process would work. The Internal Affairs Oversight Panel announced by Walsh will replace the existing Community Ombudsman Oversight Panel, or CO-OP, an entity that critics have described as relatively toothless. While the CO-OP could review no more than 20 percent of completed internal-affairs cases, the IAOP will be able to review all completed cases, as well as the BPD\u2019s internal-affairs policies and procedures. Tanisha Sullivan, the president of the NAACP Boston Branch and a task force member, attended the conference and praised Walsh\u2019s announcement. \u201cI want to thank Mayor Walsh for not only receiving and adopting these recommendations, but for respecting the integrity of the recommendations, with an understanding that they were informed by Boston residents\u2014as well as the best structures and practices that have implemented across the country,\u201d Sullivan said. But Sullivan also added a caveat, saying the task force\u2019s vision still must be fully realized for the reform push to be deemed a success.. \u201cThe recommendations alone are not enough,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThey are simply words on paper, unless and until they are implemented.\u201d Walsh also delivered grim news about COVID in Boston, saying the city\u2019s new case count reached 355 Thursday \u2014 the highest total since early June \u2014 and that while the citywide positivity rate remains 7.2 percent, it\u2019s climbed past 16 percent in East Boston. \u201cWe are at another critical point,\u201d Walsh said, urging Boston residents to do everything possible to curtail the virus\u2019s continued spread. Walsh also condemned proposed cutbacks at the MBTA, which is struggling from a revenue shortfall as the pandemic rages on, saying they\u2019d be economically devastating and especially ill-advised given COVID. \u201cThese cuts undermine our COVID responses \u2014 to be able to have physical distancing on trains and buses,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt hurts the essential and frontline worker[s], who have the fewest transportation options.\u201d In a Q-and-A session following his prepared remarks, Walsh said he hasn\u2019t been contacted by Joe Biden\u2019s transition team about a possible role in the president-elect\u2019s cabinet \u2014 and that while he\u2019s honored to have his name mentioned, his attention is squarely focused on governing Boston. \u201cI love my job as mayor,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking forward to, the next several years, working with an administration in Washington that believes in science, that believes in immigration rights, that believes in infrastructure, that believes in housing, that believes in climate change,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a real big difference.\u201d Reporter Saraya Wintersmith contributed to this report.",

      "body": "The House gaveled into the second day of budget deliberations Thursday and approved a second mega-amendment dealing with health and human services, public health, elder affairs, mental health, and disability services topics.Although a holiday offered a reprieve to some during budget week, House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz said Tuesday that he and other staff members would be working through Veterans Day. Lawmakers used most of the first budget session to meet privately in Zoom calls to wrangle some of the over 700 amendments to the budget bill, including those contained in the second consolidated amendment.The bundle, which the House unanimously approved on Thursday, includes funding for prevention, intervention, and recovery services, local earmarks for youth development initiatives, money for services to address behavioral health needs arising from the impact of COVID-19, and sets up a trust fund administered by the secretary of health and human services for Medicaid payments to nonpublic ambulance services.Another portion of the amendment directs the Department of Public Health to issue a report by Feb. 1, 2021 on rules, regulations, guidance, and best practices to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 from patients discharged from hospital facilities to nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, skilled nursing facilities, and other congregate care facilities.The House on Tuesday approved the first consolidated amendment dealing with local aid, education, transportation, social services, veteran services, and soldiers' homes.Just after noon on Thursday, the House had not yet dealt with three closely watched amendments related to abortion access in Massachusetts (759), an extension of the eviction and foreclosure moratorium through at least Jan. 1, 2021 (777), and requiring the governor to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy with an appointee of the same political party as the person leaving office (578).",

      "body": "The state Democratic Party is set to vote on its leadership this evening. The choice the party makes and how it reaches that decision will have repercussions here in Massachusetts, and it could tell us something about national politics as well. GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath discussed the race with GBH Radio's Adam Reilly. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: National politics has been sucking all of the oxygen out of the room and then some, but there's some interesting stuff here. Tell us about the vote that's going to decide who serves as the chair of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. Who's running?Adam Reilly: It's a three person race. We've got the current chair, a guy named Gus Bickford, a longtime political operative who's worked for a bunch of big names behind the scenes over the years. He wants to keep his job and get another four-year term. He is running against and getting a challenge from Bob Massie, the former gubernatorial candidate who lost to Jay Gonzalez in the race for the Democratic nomination in the last election cycle. Also Mike Lake, who some will recognize as a candidate for lieutenant governor back in 2014. So we have three white men, which is something that some of those white men themselves bemoan. I think there's a keen awareness that the party needs to get more diverse, especially in leadership positions. But while three guys who demographically are pretty similar are going for the job, they are not the same when it comes to philosophy, about what the job should be. Rath: Talk about that. What are their their pitches? What are the differences in philosophy? Reilly: The big argument that Bob Massie makes is that the party shouldn't just be focused on getting people into office, it should also be focused on pressuring Democrats to act the right way once they've been elected. He's been circulating a 30-plus page manifesto to the members of the Democratic State Committee who are going to vote on the next chair, and he points out that even though the legislature is overwhelmingly Democratic, there are a whole bunch of pieces of lingering progressive legislation that is right in keeping with the party's platform. Party platforms are these sort of idealistic documents in which parties state what their priorities are. They describe the world that they would like to see come into existence. Massie says we've got all these Democrats on Beacon Hill and all this legislation that corresponds with what we say, our platform, that isn't getting passed, and it should be the job of the state party to push and hector and try to get people to vote the right way once they've won election.Bickford, the incumbent, has a much more traditional conception of what the party is about. He thinks it's about winning elections, finding the financial resources, the organizational resources to help Democrats get elected, although he concedes that the party could do better than it has as serving as a source of pressure from the outside. Mike Lake, I would say, has a similar take to Massie's, although his critique is a little bit less detailed. He also, when I chatted with him, talked about the parties need to connect with constituencies that it's tended to take for granted over the years, to give people reasons to identify as Democrats. For example, women of color on the one hand and working class white men on the other. He believes that the party isn't doing enough to say to people, hey, you should be a Democrat given what your priorities are, so why aren't you one? Come on into the fold.Rath: You mentioned how some of these local stories we've been missing because of everything else going on right now. One would ordinarily would have been a headline grabbing scandal was hat happened in the Massachusetts 1st Congressional District between incumbent Congressman Richard Neal and his challenger, Holyoke mayor Alex Morse. Refresh our memory about that scandal. Reilly: I'm glad you brought that up, because it's playing a role in this race. This was the scandal involving Holyoke mayor Alex Morse, who was challenging that Democratic congressional incumbent Richard Neal in the 1st congressional district. Morse was accused by the College Democrats of Massachusetts of inappropriate behavior involving their members, making inappropriate overtures to some of their members. And then as the state party heard about this, the state party was accused of inappropriately putting their finger on the scale and intervening, trying to steer these complaints in certain directions that would help Neal, the incumbent, keep his seat in the primary and  hurt Morse. There was a confidential report created for the Massachusetts Democratic Party which found that Gus Bickford, the incumbent chair, had erred by suggesting that one of these younger Democratic activists contact a reporter, that that constituted a violation of state bylaws that say that party staff cannot get involved in primaries, that they have to stay neutral. I've seen this document. It is not scathing. I wouldn't say that it identifies a vast conspiracy to take Alex Morse down, but it did chide Bickford for taking this step. When I talk to Bickford about this, he said basically that there was no ill intent here on our part, we didn't have an established protocol for dealing with this kind of thing, I feel terrible that people have been hurt by this, and because I know what happened, I'm in a position to help heal the party moving forward. Rath: There's a lot of Democratic soul-searching right now because across the country, Democrats didn't do as well as expected. I'm even talking about Democrats at the local level across the country who didn't do as well as expected. First off, how was the election for Massachusetts Democrats? And how much are those broader party debates affecting what we're talking about right now, the contest tonight? Reilly: For Massachusetts Democrats, they're in fine shape. I mean, they have maintained virtually total control in the State House. The congressional delegation is all Democratic. The big catch, of course, is that they don't have the governorship. Some people would tell you that some of the Democrats on Beacon Hill don't want the governorship and they like working with Governor Baker, perhaps more than they might have liked working with Deval Patrick, who is a member of their own party, back in the day. They're not sweating here, but what I do think we see at play in this race for state party chair - and by the way, all three candidates say they've got the answer for taking back the corner office, that they've got to work harder and be crisper when it comes to differentiating themselves from Charlie Baker and him from them - what I do think we see a play here is a combination of a proposed change in tactics and ideology. I'm thinking here especially about Massie and to some extent Mike Lake. If you have the state party as an outside entity that is pushing legislators once they've been elected to follow the party platform, you are effectively going to be pushing the party to the left. That gets us into these debates that we've heard from congresspeople who lost their seats or almost lost their seats, who say oh, we can never let the word socialism cross our lips again, we can't talk about defunding the police or Medicare for All. And then other Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez say no, we didn't lose because we were talking about that stuff, we lost because we didn't run campaigns well. These big ideas for, I think Elizabeth Warren might have coined the phrase or appropriated phrase \"big structural change\" - these are the ideas that we need to be passionate about in order to win elections that we're not winning. So in that sense, I think this race isn't only about that discussion, but it is at least in part about that conversation that's going on.Rath: Will we get sense out of this vote tonight which of those directions the Massachusetts Democrats might be taking? Reilly: I think we'll get some sense, but there are also issues of personality at play here. There are some people who for various reasons aren't fans of Bickford. There are other people who for various reasons are kind of Massie and Lake. What we might get is some sense of how strong the progressive left is in comparison with more standard, centrist, traditional Massachusetts Democrats. I think of people like House Speaker Robert DeLeo, who embodies that type. We might get a sense of where that balance of power is right now in the state party, which could be a tea leaf to read as we start looking at which Democrats are going to challenge Governor Baker and which ones are going to gain traction as they try to get the nomination.",

      "body": "The voices of Black people in Boston are constantly silenced, marginalized, and ignored. Our advocacy for our rights and opportunities makes other people uncomfortable, so they label us as the problem instead of acknowledging and addressing the real problems we identify. Black people are approximately 25% of Boston\u2019s population, but make up more than one-third of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Boston -- and we are still disportionately dying! Most live in communities that have been under-resourced for generations. Black people are often systematically locked into jobs and industries that are low paying, less stable, and limited in upward mobility -- and locked out of opportunity for generations.  Black Boston COVID-19 Coalition (BBCC) has been in the forefront of challenging the Governor, the Mayor, and elected officials on their less than adequate response to COVID-19 in neighborhoods with large concentrations of Black and Latinx people - Dorchester, Mattapan, Roxbury, and Hyde Park. BBCC has clearly stated demands and offered to have, as Mayor Walsh stated, \u201ca conversation that can produce lasting, systemic change to eliminate all the ways that racism and inequality harm our residents.\u201d BBCC actually went a step further and extended our hand in real partnership for transformational change.  Despite the avalanche of words by the Mayor and other public officials that racism is a public health emergency and that they want to engage with Black communities, they still haven\u2019t! This silent treatment and dismissiveness from government officials is consistent with their ongoing response before and during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here is the evidence:  Testing and Contact Tracing: Since the COVID-19 outbreak in Boston, BBCC has asked city officials to partner with community groups on free, accessible testing. Why? To ensure strategies are appropriate and communities feel safe to take advantage of testing sites. To date, there is not nearly enough testing in our community. The City lacks a coordinated strategy to monitor infection and death rates, and to determine sustainable efforts to reduce new infections and protect our community so that it and the city are safe to reopen.  Public Gatherings: Gatherings in Cohasset, Chatham, and Boston Harbor in August were met with an immediate public health response -- including mass COVID-19 testing. However, similar gatherings in Black communities were dismissed. BBCC\u2019s press conference highlighted the community outrage. Its members demanded a response that included mass testing, PPE distribution, and public education. However, the Governor, the Mayor, and other elected officials responded by increasing police presence in Black neighborhoods.  COVID-19 Vaccine Trials: Task forces/committees are being created with no decision-making power to plan, design, implement, and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine trials.These structures in Boston and around the country are being used as a cover to push through a vaccine that puts speed and profit over people\u2019s lives.  Reopening of Schools: There is still no strategy for addressing the pre-COVID-19 racial inequities in Boston Public Schools, which are now worsened by the pandemic. The buildings, including their air filtration systems, are not safe and ready. Families\u2019 access to computers and the internet has not been addressed. There have been no explicit plans to protect Black and Latinx children, who represent the majority of child deaths from COVID-19.  Contracts to Black Businesses & Disparities in Wealth: Since COVID-19, only one \u201cminority\u201d business has been represented among eighty businesses awarded emergency contracts between March and June. Pre-COVID, out of $664 million of City of Boston contracts, less than .05% was spent with businesses owned by people of color and women. If this is just the local government, who knows what the private sector and nonprofit organizations are spending. And we wonder why there is an average of $8 in Black wealth vs $247,500 in White wealth.  Community Engagement and Partnership: In addition to testing and vaccine trials, the state\u2019s COVID-19 Community Impact Survey is another example of pretending to engage the community but actually dismissing its voice. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health asked community organizations to disseminate a survey that would capture the \u201chealth needs, concerns, inequities, and unintended consequences related to the crisis.\u201d During the informational webinars, community participants voiced concerns about the survey not capturing critical needs and not being culturally and linguistically appropriate. The contracting process to manage this project -- including survey development and community engagement -- was not transparent nor accountable.  This pattern of behavior from local and state public officials shows how racism is impacting Boston\u2019s Black community -- and it\u2019s unacceptable. What we are looking at is how political leaders and public institutions continue to fail our community and deepen alarming racial inequities.

      "body": "The state will reopen the field hospital at Worcester's DCU Center next month to handle any overflow of COVID-19 patients.Governor Charlie Baker made the announcement at his regular Covid-19 press briefing, saying the recent surge in cases warranted reactivating the field hospital, which was one of several opened across the state last Spring. The Worcester field hospital was decommissioned in June after the state\u2019s first wave of Covid-19 cases subsided.The Massachusetts National Guard will install 240 beds to be ready for patients in early December. UMass Memorial Medical Center, which previously administered patient care at the DCU Center, will resume that responsibility.Appearing with Governor Baker, UMass Memorial president Eric Dickson said their main medical facility in Worcester is now full and some elective procedures are being cancelled.Dickson said UMass Memorial, the largest hospital in central Massachusetts, is no longer able to accept referrals from smaller hospitals that rely on it.\"And that is because we haven't all followed the rules,\u201dDickson said. \u201cAnd so we will stand up, once again, the DCU field hospital, and once again, I will have to ask our caregivers to rise to the occasion and to take care of our communities when they need us most.\"Samantha Phillips, the governor\u2019s emergency management chief said the state will explore opening more field hospitals as the situation gets worse. That could include the 1,000-bed \u2018Boston Hope Medical Center,\u2019 which operated at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center until it also was decommissioned in June.Throughout his Friday press conference, Governor Baker again urged residents to act responsibly in informal settings. which he says are the primary venues for transmitting the virus.\"People need to change their behavior and get serious about who they spend time with, how they act, and why Massachusetts is at risk, primarily because of a lot of the things people do when they put down their guard,\" Baker said.In an unrelated matter, Baker declined to say whether he would veto part of the House's budget bill passed Thursday night that would allow abortions for patients over 15 years old without a parent's permission, as well as allow the procedure in cases of lethal fetal anomalies.",

This year's session was extended.The speaker's office said the employee who tested positive Saturday was at the State House more recently on Oct. 27, but neither reported having any close contacts with other members or employees, DeLeo wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by the News Service.Separately, the speaker's office said it found out Sunday that two additional House employees had tested positive for COVID-19, with one reporting having been at the State House on Monday, Nov. 9 and the other last there on Thursday, Nov. 12.Thursday was the day the House passed a $46 billion annual state budget bill, after which two legislators who had been present for the budget debate tested positive on Friday. DeLeo said all close contacts of the two employees who were at the State House last week have been notified.\"As we all know from daily news reports the virus continues to circulate in the community. Therefore, we will very likely have more self-reported cases from Members and employees in the coming days and weeks,\" DeLeo wrote in his email. \"Should we become aware of additional cases of COVID-19, we will implement our COVID-19 response protocol and notify all Members and staff.\"The speaker's office has not identified any legislators or staff who have tested positive, citing health confidentiality laws, but DeLeo said all offices used by infected employees will undergo environmental cleaning before anyone is allowed to return to those spaces.DeLeo further reminded that only staff who are \"essential to the discharge of House operations, including sessions of the House, should be physically at the State House at this point.\"The State House has not reopened to the public since it was closed in March. The Senate plans to debate its version of the fiscal 2021 state budget this week, which will to bring some senators and staff from that branch back to the building.",

      "body": "With plans to open debate on its version of a $46 billion state budget on Tuesday, Senate leaders are weighing a raft of major policy proposals offered by senators as amendments to the legislation, including efforts to head off MBTA service reductions.Senators filed 473 amendments to the annual state spending bill, which is currently four-and-a-half months overdue. Legislative leaders hope to wrap up the bill for Gov. Charlie Baker to sign by the end of the month, and have cautioned against making major additions to the framework negotiated between the branches in the interest of preventing the budget from getting bogged down.Still, the House added an expansion of abortion access to its budget bill, and Senate President Emerita Harriette Chandler filed a similar version of the ROE Act as an amendment to Senate budget.With the MBTA proposing drastic service reductions in response to reduced ridership, Sen. Jason Lewis filed an amendment that would prevent the agency from closing commuter rail stations and eliminating transit services, including bus routes, that would \"unduly harm public transit riders.\"Lewis is proposing to increase the state's operating transfer to the MBTA from $127 million for $435 million this year. Sen. Patrick O'Connor filed a more parochial amendment to prevent the T from eliminating the Hingham-Hull ferry, and requiring the agency to maintain 25 percent of its service capacity.Senate Ways and Means Chairman Michael Rodrigues last week made clear that he had little appetite for adding tax hikes to the budget, which the House also rejected. But that didn't stop members like Sen. Jo Comerford from filing for an increase in the corporate excise tax or Sen. Joe Boncore proposing a new fee structure for transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft.Minority Leader Bruce Tarr, who was frustrated last week that Democrats would attempt to use the budget to advance major policy initiatives in a lame-duck session, also filed his own plan to legalize sports betting.Sport wagering is a potential revenue generator backed by Gov. Baker that is also being negotiated by a conference committee of the two branches as part of a larger economic development package. Sens. Brendan Crighton and Paul Feeney filed their own sports wagering amendment to the budget.The amendment load averages out to 11.8 per senator compared to the 4.8 amendments-per-member average in the House last week, where the membership mashed its adopted amendments into four mega-amendments.",

      "body": "Addressing the health disparities highlighted and exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic will require looking beyond the medical sector alone, doctors said Monday during a panel hosted by Attorney General Maura Healey.A new report from Healey's office outlines steps the state can take to address health inequities, including building a more diverse health care workforce, improving the collection and sharing of demographic data and ensuring that all populations have access to the same care resources.The report opens by describing a \"bleak picture\" of racial and ethnic health care disparities in Massachusetts, saying people of color here are generally \"less healthy and die younger than white residents,\" with higher rates of heart failure, stroke hospitalization and diabetes-related deaths.The infant mortality rate for the state's Black newborns is twice that of white newborns and Black mothers are more likely to die in connection with pregnancy than white mothers; Asian Boston residents are more likely than their white counterparts to have hepatitis B and liver cancer; and Hispanic Massachusetts residents have an HIV infection rate that is more than six times higher than it it is for non-Hispanic white residents, the report says.COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death rates are also notably higher for Massachusetts residents of color than for white residents, the report notes, citing Department of Public Health data.\"We've known a long time about these disparities and while some progress has been made, it's time to treat this issue like the problem that it really is,\" Healey said. \"It's a generations-long public health crisis calling out for urgent action, not an unfortunate but intractable problem. Meeting this crisis with the urgency it demands will mean reimagining some parts of our health care and our public health systems, and I know that our state is up to the challenge.\"The report recommends boosting access to telehealth and doing so in a way that does not worsen existing disparities by leaving behind lower-income, older and rural populations, and those that do not speak English.\"The realization that about 41,000 households in the Boston area don't have access to internet really makes it very apparent how people are benefitting from telehealth, which we know is very important and very critical for how we're providing care for patients right now and probably will continue to be very important going forward,\" Dr. Mothusi Chilume of East Boston Neighborhood Health Center said during the Zoom discussion. \"If there are big sections of our population that don't have the ability to really avail themselves of this, this is going to lead to more issues with inequity.\"To make free and low-cost internet access and devices more widely available in underserved areas, the report calls for expanding state grants and subsidies, advocating for more federal funding and developing public-private partnerships.On the health insurance front, Healey's report recommends the state require \"coverage and payment parity across all carriers for telehealth services over the next two years\" and \"ensure payment parity between telephonic, video, and in-person visits, where clinically appropriate.\"Differing House-Senate bills that look to build on emergency orders from Gov. Charlie Baker and cement telehealth's place in the care system have been before a conference committee of six lawmakers since July 31.Monica Escobar Lowell of UMass Memorial Health Care said uneven access to the internet and devices has consequences beyond telehealth access, pointing to children engaged in remote learning.\"I'm particularly concerned with the possibility of losing an entire generation of children, with their families who do not have access to technology,\" she said. \"We will have a whole cohort of, again, vulnerable populations that are not getting educated and will not be able then to be successful, get jobs, and if we couple that with the mental health problems the pandemic has exacerbated, and add all the upstream and downstream social determinants of health, imagine we as a society in about 20 years. We will be in tough shape.\"Along with access to technology, panelists highlighted other non-medical factors, like access to affordable housing and paid sick leave, which they said can make it easier for people to quarantine if they have COVID-19 symptoms.\"Our public health response really can't be divorced from public policy, and we can't solve these problems by ourselves as health care professionals,\" Massachusetts General Hospital neurologist Dr. Altaf Saadi said.Saadi said she had a patient with severe early onset dementia who lost his job and had to move in with his elderly mother.The mother lived in public housing and was not permitted to have another resident in her home, so the agency moved to evict her. The since-expired eviction moratorium the state had in place at the time \"bought us time to advocate for her and her son to obtain alternative housing arrangements,\" Saadi said.Chilume said that the median rent for a two-bedroom in the Boston area is about $2,500.\"It's not surprising that we have households that are multigenerational, with people who are living together who have low-paying jobs who are forced to make really difficult decisions, as the attorney general mentioned, about whether to continue to work, whether to stay home, how to get to work, and so on and so forth,\" he said. \"Thinking about this along those lines will really help us not only deal with this pandemic here but really address how we provide health care to our population in the future.\"",

      "body": "It's been more than a week since virtually every major news outlet called the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's legal team continues to litigate baseless claims about voter fraud, which has raised a number of ethical concerns within the legal community. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University law professor and GBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed about some of the ethical challenges lawyers filing the suits may face. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: Before we get to the ethics here, talk to us about the latest on the legal front. I was just mentioning Pennsylvania in that newscast. Are any of President Trump's allegations actually gaining traction? Daniel Medwed: It doesn't look like it. He's filed more than 30 lawsuits in six different states and he's already piled up about 20 losses, not to mention losing three lawyers who dropped out of that Pennsylvania case you mentioned just late last night. There's really no coherent strategy here \u2014 we've talked about this over the course of the past couple of weeks \u2014 and the gap right now, the voting differential, is just so wide and the number of states in play so diffuse, I don't see any realistic chance of overturning that result, at least through legal means. Mathieu: So the president has hired some top tier law firms here, and those firms are getting a lot of criticism from within legal circles and, of course, beyond. But what's the argument here when it comes to legitimacy of handling these cases? Is there no ethical problem here? Medwed: Well, that argument basically has two components to it. First, there's what I'd call the autonomy argument, that lawyers should have the discretion to pick and choose the clients they want to represent without succumbing to public pressure, and that instead their conscience and business model should guide that decision. The second argument is more structural, that it's really important to represent or vindicate the interests of unpopular clients. That's a way of protecting minority interests from the whims of the majority. It's sometimes articulated as that the hallmark of a civilized society is the extent to which we zealously defend the interests of our most reviled members. John Adams famously trotted out this argument to justify defending a red coat during revolutionary times. And in this context, I think it's at least superficially compelling, this idea that the public shouldn't dictate who lawyers represent, that that's a slippery slope that will get us to a place we don't want to be. Mathieu:  You said superficial, Daniel. What's the counterargument that maybe these lawyers have crossed a line? Medwed: The counter argument looks like this, and I think it might carry the day. It's one thing to represent an unpopular client. That's fine. It's something else to file baseless, groundless claims on behalf of the most powerful figure in the world, the President of the United States. Each state basically has the authority and the capacity to regulate lawyer behavior, and to do that, they've passed a number of ethics rules that basically modulate how lawyers conduct themselves. Every state has some version of a rule known as the rule of candor. It requires that lawyers shall not knowingly file false statements of fact or law to a judicial tribunal, nor should they knowingly present false evidence to a court. So the argument against these lawyers looks a little bit like this: that by making allegations of voting improprieties without data to substantiate those claims, these lawyers might be violating the rule of candor, depending on how it's defined and interpreted in the jurisdiction where they practice. Mathieu: So let's say that a lawyer crosses the line here and maybe there is some retribution after. I don't know if we're going to go into counter lawsuits here. Would someone have to file a misconduct claim against the lawyer or against their firm? Medwed: Yes. So allegations of misconduct or malpractise are usually filed with the State Bar by an aggrieved client, a client who says that her attorney didn't represent her properly. In this instance, I don't see President Trump necessarily filing an ethics grievance against his lawyers, at least at this stage. He does have a tendency when things go south to turn on the people who have helped him, so that's something we could be talking about down the road. But more notably, in many states, third parties \u2014 people who are not connected to a particular case [and] who aren't represented by that lawyer \u2014 have the ability to file grievances. So, in fact, I've done this in California. A couple prosecutors in California, in my view, overstepped the rules of ethics and harmed criminal defendants, so I've submitted some pending Bar complaints against them. In terms of the result, if the State Bar determines that a grievance is credible, then the punishment really runs the gamut. So at the mild end, the lawyer could get maybe a letter of censure or a reprimand, but at the severe end, they're facing a suspension of their license to practice law or even potentially disbarment.

Charlie Baker will nominate Serge Georges Jr. as a justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, according to a source in the administration, capping off a string of judicial selections that will solidify Baker's significant mark on the 328-year-old high court.Georges currently serves as an associate justice on the Boston Municipal Court sitting in the Dorchester Division, a position he was nominated to by Gov. Deval Patrick in 2013. From 2014 to 2018, Georges presided over the Dorchester Drug Court. Before becoming a judge, he focused on commercial and business litigation, criminal defense, and professional licensure and liability during a solo practice.Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito are planning to introduce Georges and discuss his nomination during a State House press conference scheduled for 1 p.m.Already, Baker has nominated Justice Kimberly Budd to step into the chief justice role and has tapped Appeals Court Judge Dalila Argaez Wendlandt to be elevated to the SJC bench. The latest flurry of nominations -- Baker made three SJC nominations in a similarly compressed time frame in 2016 -- came as Justice Barbara Lenk approaches the mandatory retirement age early next month and after the September death of Chief Justice Ralph Gants.Gants and Lenk were the only two justices on the SJC not nominated to those positions by Baker, and now the second-term Republican is poised to have seven of his own selections sitting on the SJC.The Governor's Council, which vets and confirms Baker's nominees, will hold a hearing on Wendlant's confirmation Wednesday morning and is also expected to vote on Budd's promotion to chief. The council could schedule a confirmation hearing for Georges when it meets Wednesday.\"Our hope would be that if we get a couple of really good people in front of the Governor's Council shortly, they'll be able to find a way to make the schedule work between now and the end of the year,\" Baker said recently about the pending nominations. \"I know the folks that are currently on the court would like to see us nominate folks and try to get it done by the end of the calendar year. That's the goal.\"Following Lenk's retirement, the most senior justice on the SJC will be Justice Frank Gaziano, who was nominated by Baker and took the oath of office Aug. 18, 2016. Budd and Justice David Lowy were sworn in Aug. 24, 2016. Justice Elspeth Cypher was elevated from the Appeals Court to the SJC on March 31, 2017 and former Appeals Court Chief Justice Scott Kafker joined the SJC on Aug. 21, 2017.",

      "body": "A Thanksgiving meal that would be routine any other year could result in a 911 call and a fine, warns Boston Mayor Marty Walsh.As Boston hit an average of 224 new cases of COVID-19 a day, Walsh announced a range of new metrics the city will use for measuring the pandemic's growth. He also threatened to enforce the city's ban on more than 10 people gathering indoors for the upcoming holiday.\"We don't want to do this, but as the holidays go on, people are going to call 911,\" Walsh said, adding that police would show up and notify the city's Inspectional Services Department, which will issue fines.\"I mean, that's the last thing I want to do on Thanksgiving,\" Walsh said. \"And I know people aren't agreeing with what I'm saying right now. But the numbers aren't lying.\"Walsh also had a request for the college students who would ordinarily go home for the Thanksgiving holiday.\"We have asked colleges and students not to do that this year,\" he said. \"If you go home for Thanksgiving, you should not be returning to Boston this semester. You should do the rest of your learning remotely.\"Last week, Walsh said, the citywide positivity rate for COVID-19 tests was 9.6 percent, with seven neighborhoods above 10 percent. Walsh said East Boston, Dorchester and Hyde Park had the highest increase in cases.Walsh announced the city will start to measure the spread of the pandemic using a new collection of six key measures - each with its own \"threshold of concern,\" which could collectively trigger more stringent restrictions if reached.\"The goal is to give the most current and comprehensive picture of the virus that we can,\" he said.Those metrics include a change in the way the city measures the rate of positive tests, to focus on the most recent test results, with the goal of getting a more accurate picture of the current situation. The city will also consider capacity in hospital intensive care units and the number of available hospital beds as well as the number of patients visiting emergency rooms who are confirmed or presumed to be infected.Walsh emphasized the success Boston had over the summer keeping case numbers down.\"That's the work of people,\" he said. \"That wasn't anything that any of us did in government. It wasn't the work of any of us.\"The virus' spread was limited during that period, he said, by the power of residents' collective action.\"We're asking people to continue to wear masks any time you're outside your home,\" he said. \"Wash your hands with soap and warm water as often as possible, wipe down frequently touched areas, and avoid gatherings or groups outside of your household.\"",

Charlie] Baker and for local mayors to decide if they want to enact harsh measures to contain the virus,\u201d she said, reflecting on her recent piece for the Boston Globe, which she co-wrote with reporter Tim Logan. The latest data from the Mass. Department of Public Health indicates that the seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases in the state is at 1,916 \u2014 more than 1,000 percent above its lowest point during the pandemic. Leung said it's \u201cshameful\" that federal leaders haven\u2019t been able to pass a new stimulus deal since the CARES Act in March. She contrasted the U.S. response with how countries like Germany and the U.K. \u2014 which are paying upwards of 80% of worker salaries in order to keep people financially afloat and indoors \u2014 are handling the pandemic.Last Friday, Baker signalled that he intends to allow schools and business to remain open, in part because the number of schools and businesses found in conflict with state rules has been, in his words, \"very small.\u201d ",

Federal officials say they are closing the part of the investigation looking into \u201crestrictive housing and geriatric and palliative care,\u201d the news release said.\u201cOur investigation revealed that MDOC fails to provide adequate mental health treatment to prisoners experiencing a mental health crisis and instead exposes them to conditions that harm them or place them at serious risk of harm,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division. \u201cRemedying these deficiencies promptly will ensure that we protect the constitutional rights of these vulnerable prisoners and promote public safety.\u201dDOC officials said in a press statement on Tuesday evening that they have \u201calready begun to address issues\u201d raised in the report and have made \u201csignificant progress.\u201dAmong steps to make the system safer, they say they have stopped selling razors to prisoners in certain prisons, provided new training to staff about how to deal with people in crisis and meet regularly to discuss histories of people who harm themselves and develop with ways to intervene. The state prison system currently incarcerates about 6,700 people in 16 facilities.\u201cThe Department remains deeply committed to the health and well-being of all entrusted to our care and fully invested in protecting their physical safety and civil rights,\u201d a spokesperson said.Elizabeth Matos, executive director of the Boston-based nonprofit Prisoners' Legal Services, says she\u2019s not surprised by the findings. Prisoners experiencing a crisis are often put on mental health watch, she said, \u201cwhich is widely referred to as worse than solitary confinement.\u201d Matos said the system-wide lockdowns prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic have only made conditions worse among those incarcerated in the state\u2019s prisions and jails, increasing suicide attempts and self-harm. \u201cWe are hopeful that the DOC will follow recommendations for improvements made by the USDOJ,\u2019\u2019 she said in a prepared statement, \u201cbut this is yet another reason to reduce the population in our prisons and jails to prevent further harm during this pandemic.\u201dThis article has been updated with a comment from the DOC.",

      "body": "Gov. Charlie Baker has named yet another jurist to sit on the state's highest court. If Judge Serge Georges and other recent Baker nominees are confirmed, the governor will have chosen all seven justices on the Supreme Judicial Court. Northeastern University Law Professor and GBH News Legal Analyst Daniel Medwed discussed Georges with GBH All Things Considered Host Arun Rath. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: Tell us what we should know about Judge Georges.Daniel Medwed: Well, quite a few things, actually. He is a very, very good judge. This is a terrific choice. For one thing, he is considered to be one of the kindest and fairest judges in the whole commonwealth. One of my pals, Margo Lindauer, who teaches with me at Northwestern, does a lot of practice in Dorchester. She told me that he is just the most amazing judge. She even said to me \u2014 and as a seasoned lawyer, you don't hear this very often \u2014 \"he made me believe in justice.\" And in addition to that, he is incredibly kind. Apparently, he treats everyone with the utmost respect and courtesy, ranging from criminal defendants to prosecutors to support staff. He's always ready to shake a hand, I guess, at least in the pre-COVID days, and always to lend an ear. So he's really a terrific person and a great jurist. Rath: If Georges and the other pending nominees are confirmed, that would mean that all seven justices on the SJC will be Baker appointees. Is that any cause for concern? Are there any issues about ideological diversity, about the court becoming too similar? Medwed: In theory, it is a cause for concern whenever one governor \u2014 in this case, Charlie Baker \u2014 has had a chance to put his stamp on the court in such a dramatic way. I think it's only happened once in our history before. John Hancock had the opportunity to put seven justices on the SJC. But Gov. Baker has done a wonderful job. I've been very tough on him about this, but look at what he's done. This is the most diverse court in terms of racial and ethnic diversity. We have three people of color on a seven-person court. It also has more ideological diversity than one might think, especially with the likely addition of Judge Georges, given his experience in the trenches. It's very rare for a judge to be elevated from the district court level. Right now, Judge Georges sits in Boston Municipal Court. To go from the Boston Municipal Court all the way to the SJC, it means he's bringing a wealth of practical experience. He has been a solo practitioner, he has some criminal defense experience, and I think that perspective will really help the court, because sometimes appellate courts are a little bit like an ivory tower. They're so far removed from the trenches. He'll make sure that the court isn't that distant. Rath: When there's a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, it's the Senate that debates and confirms the president's nominee. We saw that just last month. But here in Massachusetts, the state Senate does not handle appointments to the bench. Instead, there's the eight-member Governor's Council. It's an elected advisory panel that goes back to the 17th century, apparently. Is this too baroque of a process? It seems like it's in a limited number of hands. Medwed: I think that's really interesting. You would hope that the whole Senate, the House, the whole legislature would weigh in on something as groundbreaking and important as a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court appointment. But you're right, it's just the eight-person Governors Council. They are elected, but I frankly, I don't think many people pay much attention to it. It's not like it's the gubernatorial election or something like that. So there is something that feels slightly less, I don't know if the word \"democratic\" is the right one, but there aren't as many voices being heard in debating whether the person should be appointed. And essentially, the Governor's Council provides a rubber stamp, at least historically, to the governor's nominations, to the SJC. Right now we're debating all of these issues in our government \u2014 like the Electoral College at the federal level. It's an interesting issue about the utility of the Governor's Council.",

      "body": "The FDA has granted emergency approval to Eli Lilly's antibody treatment for COVID-19. The news comes as biopharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Moderna have announced that preliminary data from late stage clinical trials show their respective vaccines are at or nearly 95 percent effective. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University pharmaceutical sciences and chemical engineering professor Dr. Mansoor Amiji about what the latest developments mean for the world's fight against the coronavirus. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: Is Eli Lilly's treatment similar to the cocktail that President Trump was given? How effective is it? Dr. Mansoor Amiji: No, it's slightly different than what President Trump was given. He was given an antibody cocktail made by a company called Regeneron. The Lilly drug is a one, or a monoclonal, antibody. So it's just a single antibody that recognizes the spike segment of the virus and ultimately neutralizes the virus from entering the cell. Mathieu: So how capable are we now of treating COVID? I'm already hearing about shortages. Dr. Amiji: The shortages and concerns in terms of making sure that distribution is going to be effective certainly raises some alarms. The production cycles are obviously moving very fast [and] the number of infections continues to increase both in the U.S. and around the world. Right now, [the] FDA is allowing emergency authorization use of this antibody from Eli Lilly, so it's very specifically designated to a certain segment of the population, not certainly mandated for everyone. Mathieu: So this is for high risk patients. When would the general public be able to get this type of treatment? Dr. Amiji: So this is specifically designated for individuals who are not in hospitals, who are infected [and] symptomatic, but clearly not admitted yet to the hospital [and] do not require a ventilator or other emergency procedures. It is specifically designated to prevent the infection from progressing to become a severe disease in those who are at high risk. So it's a very specific population segment that it's designated for. For the general use, the studies are still ongoing, so we don't have all the data yet from Eli Lilly. So clearly, there is still a need to make sure that it is safe and efficacious in a wider range of population with different demographics, and be able to then show that it has effectiveness in that broad segment of the population. Subsequently, it will be approved for use in the larger, wider market. Mathieu: How soon after infection must it be taken, Professor? Dr. Amiji: The study that was done and published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that within about 10 days post-infection and then, subsequently, once the patients start to experience symptoms, this antibody can be administered. The data showed that it had reduced the length of the infection period significantly, and that's why the FDA is approving this for emergency use authorization, this particular antibody from Eli Lilly. Mathieu: I know the vaccine is the holy grail here \u2014 that's certainly how we treat it. But shouldn't we be spending more time, more money [and] putting more urgency behind treatments for COVID? Dr. Amiji: Certainly. I think there are obviously a lot of different companies that are also working on other treatment strategies: the antibody therapeutics, such as what we are discussing is one approach; Dexamethasone, as you may have heard, is a drug that's a corticosteroid that is already approved in the United States and other parts of the world. That also has been used in treating COVID patients, including those who suffer from the different immune reactions that occur post infection. But the encouraging news from both Pfizer and Moderna more recently, and [from] companies like AstraZeneca and others that are actually doing clinical trials in vaccines also shows a lot of promise. So I think the excitement around vaccines is clearly meant to look at the future as a way to prevent the infection, in addition to also creating therapeutics, such as what we are discussing, that will treat the infection. So I think both have to happen side by side. Mathieu: Are we going to get to the point, Professor, whether it's a treatment or a vaccine, [where] people are out there shopping for the brand or the version that they prefer? Dr. Amiji: Yes, I think at some point we will have multiple types of vaccines that would be available. We are also going to then have some understanding of which ones work best in what type of patient population. So there may be some specificity of vaccines that would be applicable for the type of person \u2014 for example, someone who's just recently infected versus somebody who's been infected but may be asymptomatic, and to individuals who are potentially highly symptomatic and may develop severe disease. So we may have those gradations in the patient populations that may benefit from these individualized vaccines. For example, the Moderna vaccine, one of the interesting data points there is that it was actually found to be effective even in those who were severely ill, and so that clearly shows that the vaccine efficacy can be, in some way, titered according to the patient's own profile, what level of infection they have and how severe the disease they have. Mathieu: We're living through an incredible time here, Professor, aren't we? Dr. Amiji: We are. This is an unfortunate time, but at the same time, I think we are seeing science \u2014 really [the] development of vaccines and therapeutics \u2014 stepping up. And the timeline to how fast this has occurred, at least in my lifetime, I haven't seen anything like this before. Then, of course, the public health measures that we are all advocating: wearing the mask, making sure that you're social distancing and taking all the necessary precautions that are mandated by the public health professionals.

Charlie Baker said, public health experts and state officials are \"very concerned\" that college students might bring COVID-19 home for the holiday.\"Today we're urging everybody to make a difficult choice this Thanksgiving. If we treat this year just like we treat every other Thanksgiving, it's quite likely that it will trigger a significant spread. And we know that that leads to serious illness for many and in rare cases death, especially among our senior citizens,\" the governor said.The safest way to celebrate Thanksgiving this year is with only members of your immediate household, Baker said. \"Any group gathering beyond this poses a significant chance of spreading the virus,\" he said, adding that the Department of Public Health has made Thanksgiving-specific guidelines available at mass.gov/thanksgiving2020.Baker said Massachusetts wants colleges and universities to make testing available to all students planning to leave campus for Thanksgiving within 72 hours of their departure. If a student tests positive, they should isolate in university housing for COVID-positive students, Baker said.The guidelines for higher education institutions were \"designed to ensure students are leaving campus, where they're often in communal spaces and with peers, free of the virus,\" he said.\"Hopefully it'll help prevent thousands of students from traveling around the state and over state lines to potentially infect their family members and loved ones with this virus when they return home,\" Baker said.Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders said an automated message from Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel will be sent to 4.5 million phone lines in Massachusetts on Thursday \"reminding residents of the increased risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19 over the coming holiday season.\"She also ticked off a list of things people should avoid this Thanksgiving: avoid sharing food and drink, avoid shaking hands or hugging, and avoid singing, dancing, and shouting.\"I know there's a lot of 'avoids' in this,\" Sudders said. She added, \"I know that for many families across the state, this guidance dramatically impacts long-standing family traditions and is devoid of human interaction we have all been missing since March, but it's crucial that we follow Department of Public Health and CDC guidance to help stop the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.\"Responding to a question about long lines at free COVID-19 testing sites around the state, Baker said he had watched some news coverage of the issue and was struck by just how many people waiting in line said they were getting tested before traveling for Thanksgiving.\"Part of what I'm concerned about here is it's pretty clear based on those lines that a lot of people are going to travel over the holidays,\" he said. \"And there's not much at this point that we can do other than say we think that's not a great idea and encourage people, if they do do that, to recognize and understand that a test is not like a Kevlar vest, OK? It's a moment in time.\"Baker also reminded people of the state's 10-person limit for private indoor gatherings, its restrictions on travelers from all states but Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Hawaii, its stay-at-home advisory and mask-wearing guidance. Sudders said that she expects \"two of our neighboring states will be added to high-risk states\" when the list is updated Friday.\"And at this point, folks should be going to school, or to work, and going home,\" the governor said. \"And if people abide by these very simple rules and concepts and do it consistently, they can allow us to keep everything open, our schools and our economy. And it can give us the kind of holiday season that I think everybody is hoping for.\"Rep. Tami Gouveia seized upon Baker's comment while he was still at the lectern to make a point about the dichotomy between Baker's comments and the reality that many businesses, including some that were previously considered \"non-essential,\" remain open.\"So confusing why @MassGovernor says that we should only go to work and school, but then allows gyms and restaurants to be open. Anyone have a logical explanation?\" the Acton Democrat tweeted.",

In the 1940s and 1950s, children at Fernald were used in experiments and later lawsuits brought to light squalid conditions and physical abuse. \u201cThis site should not be used to celebrate the holiday season or any celebration,\u201d Sandra Heller, chairperson of Massachusetts Families Organizing for Change, wrote in an email about the event. \u201cSince the residents were forced to stay in those grounds and endure abuse, neglect and experiments and [were] never treated as human beings that are valued in any way.\u201d Waltham\u2019s Mayor Jeannette McCarthy declined to speak to GBH to discuss the objections. But Waltham Lions Club President Liz Pulice said the club\u2019s decades of community service to the city included holiday activities and cookouts for Fernald Center residents and staff in its later years of operation. Their recent work has focused on pandemic aid, including food pantries and the construction of a remote learning space at the Waltham Boys and Girls Club. Pulice said since COVID had forced the cancellation of all their major fundraisers, the upcoming event was \u201can important part of our fundraising plan.\u201d\u201cNo one disputes that the Lions Club has done, and will continue to do, laudable charitable work,\u201d Rick Glassman of the Disability Law Center wrote in an email. \u201cThe issue here is whether using this site for a five week long holiday music and light show, even one raising money for charity, is disrespectful, given the history of abuse, neglect and scientific experimentation that took place at Fernald.\u201d For the full story, click the video player above.",

But the constant coverage of police brutality \u2014 while it intends to inform \u2014 often frames the Black American experience as one only of suffering and struggle, neglecting to portray Black lives as also full of beauty and joy, according to Jene\u00e9 Osterheldt, the culture columnist for the Boston Globe.Osterheldt, who aims to center Black voices in her work, told Boston Public Radio on Wednesday her latest multimedia project, \"A Beautiful Resistance,\" grew as an \"organic outburst\" of her usual work, aiming to share Black stories through a lens that portrays full humanity \u2014 acknowledging the struggle, without defining the Black experience by it. As she writes at the top of the project, \"Blackness is not a burden.\"\"I went to Minneapolis for George Floyd's memorial service. I was there during the pandemic. I was there during lockdown. It was such a hard time. When I came back here I was just very emotionally depleted and sad, and I wanted to find a way to wrap my arms around the community, and that's what this is,\" she said. \"It's me showing our joy, showing our fullness, showing our richness.\"Osterheldt said Black communities often only appear in media when violence has happened, or through a conversation about racism, but are not given the nuanced coverage afforded to their white peers.\"Too often in media, Black people are only in the news when it's a hashtag because they're dead, they're brutalized, injustice or specifically because we're talking about racism,\" she said. \"It's a problematic and racist lens that people don't want to admit that that's a bias that exists.\"The first story in the series focuses on the Black community in Martha's Vineyard from modern day vacationers to the historic Shearer Cottage \u2014 listed in the \"Negro Motorist Green Book\" as a safe place for Black visitors in the 1900s, and still operational today.The first two installments of \"A Beautiful Resistance\" are live on the Boston Globe website now, and more are forthcoming.",

Budd's father is former U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd.\"Each generation has shown how powerful a work ethic and family that has the right attitude can be,\" Hurley said. \"Captain Joe Budd was the first Black superior office in Springfield.

      "body": "Surprising though the news may have been, there was a certain inevitability to Linda Pizzuti Henry's being named chief executive officer of The Boston Globe\u2019s parent company.She had long held the title of managing director, and it has become increasingly clear over the past few years that she and her husband, publisher John Henry, were determined to impose their will on the media properties they own. Indeed, the Henrys have been calling pretty much all the shots on the business side since the summer, when Vinay Mehra exited as president and was not replaced.These are the best and worst of times for media organizations. The COVID-19 epidemic and the presidential campaign have resulted in renewed interest in the news as well as growing audiences. But advertising, already in long-term decline, has fallen off a cliff.The Globe is no exception to those trends. Earlier this year, the Globe passed the 200,000 mark for digital-only subscriptions, a long-sought-after goal. Another Globe Media property, Stat News, has established itself as one of a handful of go-to sites for news about COVID.Yet the paper, reportedly profitable before the pandemic, has been forced to trim its budget to adjust to the pandemic economy, cutting back on its use of freelancers and paid interns, for example, as well as implementing some business-side reductions.Time will tell what the Linda Henry era will bring. But here are three thoughts that I think are worth keeping in mind:\u2022 There is no longer any middleman. With co-owners John and Linda Henry holding the top two positions, all the heat will now be directed their way, for better or worse. When Mehra was in charge \u2014 and, before him, Doug Franklin and Mike Sheehan \u2014 both credit and blame could be deflected.Now the Globe is the Henrys\u2019 paper in every respect. That extends into the editorial operations as well given that editor Brian McGrory was actually involved in recruiting John Henry to buy the paper and that editorial-page editor Bina Venkataraman was hired by the Henrys.For a useful contrast, consider The Washington Post. Although owner Jeff Bezos does involve himself in business strategy to a degree, he hired a publisher, Fred Ryan, to run the paper on a day-to-day basis, and left the executive editor (Marty Baron), the editorial-page editor (Fred Hiatt) and the top technology executive (Shailesh Prakash) in place after he acquired the paper.\u2022 The Henrys must now settle an ugly labor dispute on their own. Earlier today the Boston Newspaper Guild, involved for quite some time in acrimonious contract talks with management, issued a statement ripping the Henrys for using the law firm of Jones Day, which critics say has a reputation for union-busting.That\u2019s not new. What is new is that Jones Day has been involved in representing Republicans in their attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election. \u201cHow can the Globe\u2019s political journalists be asked to continue to endure such workplace attacks from the very law firm whose actions they are now reporting on and investigating?,\u201d the union\u2019s letter asks.\u2022 The Globe is not for sale. From time to time, rumors have circulated within the newsroom and in the larger community that the Henrys are looking to get out. This happened most recently last fall, when Linda Henry presided over a town hall-style meeting on Zoom at which she was asked about a replacement for Mehra.When I asked her about it, she replied via email, \u201cThe Globe is not for sale, I\u2019m pretty sure you would have picked up on if it was.\u201d After that, the rumors appeared to fade away. Now, by occupying the top two operational roles at the Globe, the Henrys, seven years into their ownership, clearly seem to be sending a signal that they\u2019re in it for the long term.GBH News contributor Dan Kennedy is the author of \u201cThe Return of the Moguls\u201d (2018), which tracks the ownership of John Henry at The Boston Globe, Jeff Bezos at The Washington Post, and Aaron Kushner at the Orange County Register.",

She worked for the Watertown Police Department at least since 2003 and was its first female detective, the Boston Herald reported Tuesday.A judge months ago allowed the lawsuit against the department and police union to move forward.In her complaint, Donohue described a work environment characterized by sexist comments and stereotypes.She also described the scene as officers including Donohue closed in around marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in April 2013. Multiple officers fired their weapons, but Donohue held her fire as bullets whizzed by her head and hit the ground in front of her, she said in the complaint.A 2015 state inquiry found some officers used poor weapons discipline and endangered others in the crossfire.Douglas Louison, an attorney for Watertown, told the Herald, \u201cWe deny the allegations and there was never any attempt to bully her.\u201dPeter Duffy, an attorney for the Watertown police union, would not comment.The case is moving toward a jury trial, with a March deadline for depositions and discovery to end, court records show.",

      "body": "Nearly 2,000 residents from neighborhoods surrounding Melnea Cass Boulevard and Mass Ave in Boston have signed a petition criticizing the city\u2019s task force for what they say is a failure to maintain safety in the neighborhood while serving people who are experiencing homelessness or struggling with substance use disorder. Yahaira Lopez says she\u2019s witnessed individuals leaving used needles, defecating on private property, commiting violent acts and having sex in public outside her mother\u2019s house, where she grew up, on the corner of Mass Ave and Washington Street, a neighborhood sometimes referred to as the \u201cmethadone mile,\u201d or \u201crecovery row\u201d due to its high number of shelters and methadone clinics. \u201cIt\u2019s become a norm, where community members are like, yeah, this happens all the time,\u201d Lopez told GBH News. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a lack of accountability, a lack of transparency, and I'm seeing my mom, who's an elderly woman in a situation that is not allowing me to sleep at night.\u201d Kim Thai, special assistant to the mayor and the city\u2019s liaison for the area \u2014 which officials call \u201cMass and Cass\" \u2014 says issues of homelessness and substance use disorder are too vast and unpredictable to be tracked on a succinct timeline, but she acknowledges that the city\u2019s response has not been perfect. \u201cIf there was an answer to these issues, I think that every other large city across the country would be doing it the same way, as well as us,\u201d Thai told GBH News. \u201cWe recognize the frustration, and I think that sometimes we feel the same frustrations because we're doing everything that we can within our power to be able to offer as much access to treatment and services that we can.\u201d Thai says the coronavirus pandemic has \u201cexacerbated\u201d issues in the area that have existed for years. \u201cYou saw the closure of public and private facilities, a lot of service providers had to close their doors, and suddenly you just saw an influx of people on the street,\u201d Thai said. \u201cDuring that time, we had to pivot and make sure that we were providing emergency care as well as quality of care to those individuals, but we never closed our shelters. We moved a lot of our services outdoors and we created new programs to be able to provide access to bathrooms and things like that.\u201d Lopez says the representatives on the city\u2019s Mass and Cass task force\u2014 24 elected officials, educators, medical professionals, community leaders and advocates from local homelessness and substance use organizations \u2014 do not accurately represent the people who live in the community.\u201cWhat they're saying and what we're seeing is totally disconnected,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cAnd they know that this is not going to get fixed anytime soon.\u201d Mayor Marty Walsh formed the task force in October 2019, following a controversial police action that summer dubbed \u201cOperation Clean Sweep,\u201d which resulted in dozens of arrests in the Mass and Cass area. The Walsh administration also developed a new plan to combat the opioid crisis in the area by increasing the number of outreach workers, police officers and public works crews to clean up syringes, handle homeless encampments in the area, work in crisis centers and help people get treatment. When the pandemic hit Boston last March, the city went into crisis mode, which caused a major hitch in the plan, Walsh told a group of South End residents in a forum earlier this month. \u201cWe were working towards a solution and making some real gains there, and then we have the world we\u2019re in today and everything kind of got pushed backwards,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWhat we're doing now is trying to reclaim the momentum that we had six months ago in that neighborhood and addressing the issues on the street.\u201d But these same issues have persisted since the homeless shelter was closed on Long Island in 2014, and for at least the last three years, residents have been meeting with Walsh to demand changes, South End resident Janina Rackard tells GBH News. \u201cWe gave them demands, and since then it\u2019s only gotten worse,\u201d Rackard said. \u201cWe are being told there are going to be 100 used needle kiosks around the neighborhood. ... People who are high aren\u2019t putting the needles in these kiosks where they belong, and our demands are not being met.\u201d Residents, even those who support treating substance use as a health condition, have rallied against methadone clinics in Massachusetts communities including Brookline, Millbury, Salem, New Bedford, Taunton and others. In a 2019 bid for a clinic in Springfield, MassLive reported that one resident said bringing in such an establishment would mean that the neighborhood had \u201cjust become the dumping ground.\u201d \u201cIf the neighborhood is rich, they speak up about it,\u201d Rackard said. \u201cThat shows how they feel about our neighborhood and the people who live in it.\u201d The neighborhoods surrounding the Mass and Cass area are predominantly Black and socioeconomically disadvantaged, unlike Gov. Charlie Baker\u2019s hometown of Swampscott, where activists delivered used needles from Mass and Cass parks and streets to the governor\u2019s driveway last month. \u201cWe decided to bring a slice of \u2018methadone mile\u2019 to Gov. Baker's house,\u201d Lopez said, \u201cSo we dropped needles.\u201d Lauren Baker, the wife of the governor, sought a civil harassment prevention order from Lynn District Court against Hyde Park resident and protest leader Domingos DaRosa, who is now court-ordered to stay away from the governor\u2019s home. \u201cWe're asking the city to stop bullsh****ng us,\u201d DaRosa told GBH News. \u201cWe're tired of being the hamster on the wheel. You know, we're not against anybody receiving services or treatment or a placement for a home. What our issue is, the fact that we keep getting the runaround on the issue, that we are supposed to be silent. The Black community is supposed to be silent on this issue. We're not supposed to be seen or heard. One section of the city receives more than enough seats at the table where other sections of the city have to create our own space to be able to bring our concerns to the table as a collective body.\u201d Lopez says Black and Brown communities in Boston will continue to struggle with health and safety issues produced by the opioid crisis, unless efforts to rehabilitate are re-focused outside of the city and the state. \u201cThe majority of the individuals in the Mass and Cass area are not from Boston, they're coming from the white suburbia of Massachusetts, coming into our communities,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for data, we\u2019re asking for transparency. If we know that we\u2019re getting a large number of individuals that are coming from New Hampshire, it seems like Mayor Marty Walsh needs to pick up the phone and call New Hampshire and say, 'Hey, we got like 50 of your residents that are here, can you help me here?'\u201dThe city says it is working to set up 200 new beds for the winter, spread out among neighborhoods including Brighton and Mission Hill, in order to decentralize services outside of the Mass and Cass area.\u201cThat was something that was a huge central factor when we started thinking about our winter overflow plan,\u201d Thai said. \u201cSo when we're talking about treatment and shelter and overflow space, we made a point to look outside of the Mass and Cass area.\u201d Walsh has been working with the state on programs outside the Boston area to reduce the flow of people in need into one concentrated area. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to bet that roughly 50 percent of the people who are homeless on our streets come from other areas,\u201d Walsh told the neighborhood group forum. \u201cI'm not saying that we need to send them back, but what we need to do is have to have those areas step up and have them create more programing out there for people. \u2026 We've been the place that provides the services, we've been the place that takes care of people. And right now with this crisis in addiction, we need help.\u201d Thai says there is a lack of understanding about the work that is being done in the face of a growing opioid crisis, in addition to a pandemic. \u201cAll these different departments, recovery services, the police department, fire department, EMS, Inspectional Services, as well as a host of other departments that make up the coordinated response team, work every day in the Mass and Cass area,\u201d Thai said. \u201cYou know, we recognize the frustration, and I think that sometimes we feel the same frustrations because we're doing everything that we can within our power to be able to offer as much access to treatment and services that we can.\u201dJacob Ure\u00f1a, a Mattapan-based reverend and local political organizer, says he doesn\u2019t believe that the city\u2019s team of organizers feels the same urgency that residents experience by living in the community. \u201cI have worked in the nonprofit sector, specifically in homelessness and substance use disorder, and I can tell you from firsthand experience that a lot of these organizations are just there to check boxes,\u201d Ure\u00f1a told GBH News. \u201cI met with them once a month? check. I offered them an application for housing? Check. And that's it. They wipe their hands clean. They did what they had to do for the month.\u201d Though Thai says she hopes to meet communities where they are, Ure\u00f1a says he\u2019s also concerned about proposed solutions outside of Mass and Cass but inside of Boston, where other communities of color might experience a similar situation. \u201cAll of these other organizations that are offering new solutions like safe injection sites, that\u2019s great, but where are you going to put them?\u201d Ure\u00f1a said. \u201cBecause we don't want them in Mattapan. We don't want them in Dorchester. We don't want them in Roxbury.\u201d Residents are calling for an increased police presence, which goes against the ethos of the Mass and Cass task force mission, according to Thai. \u201cWhen you talk about the police presence, it's a balance, right? Because we can't arrest our way out of this situation,\u201d Thai said. \u201cIt's a constant balance between offering recovery services and treatment with ... law enforcement and making sure that everybody feels safe.\u201d Ure\u00f1a says residents are also asking for more on-the-ground social workers, but says that police have not been responsive enough to dangerous activity in the area. \u201cWe're talking about when there's violent acts and when there's people using needles in front of children or having sexual contact in front of children, the police should be active in responding to those things,\u201d Ure\u00f1a said. Marla Smith lives just outside Clifford Park, which she says is now the site of \u201cdozens\u201d of encampments. \u201cIt's covered in needles, it's covered in discarded clothes, discarded bedding, discarded food scraps and containers,\u201d Smith said. \u201cKids can't use the park.\u201d The nearest shelter has reduced capacity due to the pandemic, which creates unsafe conditions for both the unhoused community and the larger neighborhood, Smith said. \u201cThey do social distancing within the shelter, but there's no social distancing outside the shelter,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThese people are on top of each other, literally, for warmth and for safety.\u201dDamari Roman manages a subsidized housing property in the Villa Victoria neighborhood of the South End and grew up near Clifford Park. Roman says she wanted to run a subsidized housing facility because she grew up in subsidized housing in Mattapan, and prioritizes housing for both the homeless community and displaced veterans in her 146-unit building. But in recent years, Roman says conditions have worsened as the Mass and Cass population has expanded. \u201cI have already had about four or five deaths. I've walked into bodies that have been sitting there for weeks or a week or two, a lot of them because of overdosing,\u201d Roman told GBH News. \u201cMy concern is that I'm going to have to deal with this for a long time because the corner of Mass and Cass has cleared out, and a lot of those folks come over because they have friends that live at my property, and they defecate inside the hallway and leave needles everywhere.\u201d Ure\u00f1a says the community has been waiting for the crisis to alleviate, with no end in sight. \u201cThey keep telling us to wait, but they don't tell us how long we're going to have to wait,\u201d Ure\u00f1a said. \u201cWe've sacrificed enough. We sacrificed our children's trauma. We sacrificed our own trauma. We sacrificed our stoops and our parks and our schools. What else do you want?\u201d While juggling harm reduction services, crisis intervention and neighborhood issues, Thai says the city is moving as fast as it can. \u201cI understand their frustration that it's not happening fast enough,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you are offering treatment and services to someone who has a certain type of behavior, that takes time.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the city is setting up new tents and services in neighborhoods including Brighton and Mission Hill. The city is bringing on new beds in these areas.",

      "body": "This story, part one of a two-part series on colleges and minority-owned businesses, is an installment in The Color of Public Money project. The second part of the series can be found here. Out of nearly 700 active contracts awarded by a big college purchasing co-op in Massachusetts, only 14 \u2014 or 2 percent \u2014 went to minority-owned businesses certified by the state, a GBH News analysis has found.About 120 colleges belong to the Massachusetts Higher Education Consortium, which was founded in 1975 to leverage bulk purchases of commonly used items to negotiate better prices. Member institutions issue other contracts outside the consortium, for example, for construction, technology, and accounting and legal services.GBH News was unable to determine the total dollar amount of the co-op's 698 active contracts or whether some were awarded to minority-owned businesses certified in other states. But the apparently paltry level of business it does with such companies generally reflects the purchasing practices of individual colleges in Massachusetts, despite their longstanding embrace of diversity and inclusion as part of their missions, based on interviews with colleges leaders and advocates of minority contracting.\u201cWe really should be staggered by the paucity in the numbers that we're seeing from universities,\u201d said Alex Greenaway, managing director of the Greater New England Minority Supplier Diversity Council, which is based in New Haven, Connecticut. Ever since Lee Pelton took over as Emerson College\u2019s president nine years ago, he\u2019s been trying to increase the diversity of companies the private school in Boston does business with.\u201cThere's a racial wealth gap in this country, and we believe that minority development can reduce this gap and its negative effects,\u201d he said.Pelton acknowledged he has not been able to make much progress so far. Emerson has added a couple of businesses \u2014 cleaning and security companies \u2014 but currently just 3 percent of the school's contract dollars go to Black- or Hispanic-owned businesses. That\u2019s not nearly enough to make a difference in racial-ethnic disparities in wealth, he said.\u201cWe know that the Federal Bank in Boston said that the median net worth of a white family is about $247,000 and $8 for an American-born Black family,\u201d Pelton said. \u201cAnd we know that minority-owned businesses generate economic output not only directly, but also by buying goods and services from other businesses.\u201d Greenaway said only seven colleges, including Bentley and Harvard, participate in the council\u2019s program that matches minority companies with vendors. He is looking to add more because in New England universities are trendsetters.\u201cIt starts with the admissions, but it doesn't end there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also should be translated in the contracts and the way that they do business.\u201dWhy is it so hard for colleges to expand their contracting with minority-owned businesses? \u201cWhen we think about the history of business in this country, systems were set up from the inception to be able to service one group at the expense of another,\u201d Greenaway said.To break that cycle, he said colleges need to make minority contracting a priority. \u201cThese things don't happen unless someone is truly committed to it, and it has to be from the top,\u201d he explained.The council isn\u2019t alone in urging colleges to make diversifying their vendors a priority. The City of Boston is also working to match local minority-owned businesses with colleges, building relationships between buyers and vendors.\u201cIt's not just building the relationship, but preparing vendors to compete for opportunities,\u201d said Celina Barrios-Millner, the city\u2019s director of equity and inclusion. Barrios-Millner says the city government and Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce have been holding contracting clinics for minority-owned businesses.\u201c[We\u2019re] walking them through, \u2018Here's what we look for. Here's common pitfalls. Here's a response time we need,\u2019\u201d she said.So far, the city has had limited results. Barrios-Millner is actively looking to partner with private colleges because they have more money and more freedom since they\u2019re not bound by government contracting rules. \u201cThe private ones can really choose to invest and have a lot more say in who they select,\u201d she said.That\u2019s, in part, why Pelton wants other private colleges in Massachusetts to reach out to businesses owned by people of color and to support their local supply chain, a proposition he first mentioned on GBH\u2019s Basic Black. He\u2019s planning to send a letter to college presidents by the end of the year.\u201cThe presidents and chancellors of the small- and medium-sized colleges and universities never wake up in the morning thinking, \u2018Ah, let me give some thought to my procurement office and activities.\u2019 It's probably the last thing on their mind,\u201d he said.While some colleges, including Bentley and Northeastern, have recently committed to a roadmap, Pelton admits it has been hard to gain traction during the pandemic and economic downturn when budgets are so tight.Besides colleges, other nonprofits belong to the Massachusetts Higher Education Consortium. There are a total of about 2,000 members, including GBH.In a statement to GBH News, Erin Callanan, GBH\u2019s director of media relations, said the educational foundation can\u2019t speak for the consortium, adding, \u201cGBH makes purchases through a number of different sources.\u201d \u201cAs part of our ongoing efforts with diversity, equity and inclusion we are refocusing on how our workplace and business practices can be more inclusive, including our relationship with outside vendors,\u201d Callanan said. A spokeswoman for the purchasing consortium did not offer an explanation for its low level of contracting with minority-owned businesses.\"I don't know why I can't answer the question. Why so few? I don't know,\" said Nicole Miller, the consortium's director of marketing and communications. GBH News' Paul Singer and Diane Adame contributed to this report.Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified the number of years Lee Pelton has been president of Emerson. Pelton has been president since July 2011. ",

      "body": "Soon, Boston Common will be a place of reflection where people from across the country can gather to contemplate justice, peace, and the continuing struggle for racial equality.\u201cIt's going to be a beacon,\u201d said Michael Murphy, whose firm MASS Design Group is designing the memorial honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At its center, the memorial will feature The Embrace, a 22-foot bronze structure designed by artist Hank Willis Thomas. \"It's going to be a real destination, not just for Bostonians, but for the nation.\u201dHank-Willis-Thomas-with-MASS-3-1000x563.jpgAs visitors enter Boston Common, they will see the bustle of Tremont Street reflected in the sculpture, and look up to see sun beaming down through the trees, splashing light and shadows across its enfolded hands. The Embrace was inspired by the photos of Martin and Coretta Scott King hugging each other after King won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, their embrace becoming a symbol of love as a tool to fight injustice.Murphy, Founding Principal and Executive Director of MASS Design Group, joined Jared Bowen on Open Studio this week to talk about Justice Is Beauty, the firm's first monograph, which documents its philosophy for design: that architecture can promote justice and human dignity. His conversation with Bowen was the first time Murphy had shared about the forthcoming memorial\u2019s design.ModuleThe city of Boston is a fitting symbolic home for a King memorial: it\u2019s the city where Martin and Coretta first met and spent their formative educational years, as well as the homeplace of James Reeb, who was killed by white supremicists in Selma in 1965, and ministered at the Unitarian Universalist church across the street from the Common. The plaza will also be a memorial to the 1965 Freedom March that King led with Ralph Abernathy and other Boston civic leaders, which brought 22,000 people to the Common. \u201cThis is hallowed ground,\u201d Murphy said.Murphy hopes that observers will leave the memorial thinking about \u201call of those unsung heroes that have fought for social and economic justice for decades and often don't get recognized,\" he said. \"And here we have a chance to say, \u2018they hold us up,\u2019 and we can give them reverence and give them space.\u201dThe memorial is just the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d in the city\u2019s push for celebrating civil rights heroes and creating space to address historical injustice, according to Murphy. The non-profit King Boston is working to raise the remaining funds for the memorial, and pushing a new effort to build a center for economic justice in Roxbury's Nubian Square that pays tribute to King\u2019s fight against economic inequity.Murphy expects the King memorial to be completed in a year and a half, with the goal of opening in early 2022.

Their pieces are inspired by historic, experimental agrarian societies throughout New England, such as Brook Farm and Fruitlands. In \u201cTranscendental Modernism,\u201d the deCordova pulls from its own extensive holdings to create an exhibition of modern art that goes against the grain, highlighting abstract and dark artwork that harkens back to the ideas of New England\u2019s Transcendentalists.\u201cAmid COVID, amid different crises, politically, societally\u2026 we are seeing a regeneration of utopian energy,\u201d says Senior Curator Sarah Montross. \u201cThis show and other conversations I've been having align with that spirit.\u201d \u201cTo Each Era Its Art.

      "body": "The Massachusetts Port Authority plans to slash its workforce by about 25 percent through a combination of voluntary retirements and separations, furloughs, and terminations.The cost-cutting effort comes as the authority faces a massive financial strain driven by the lowest volume of Logan International Airport passengers in decades.The Massport Board of Directors voted unanimously on Thursday in support of the plan, which aims to address a $400 million budget problem and scale back the authority's operations to reflect severely reduced demand amid the pandemic.The voluntary separation program will begin immediately, while involuntary separations are expected to start in January, an authority spokesperson said.Officials said Massport is built and staffed to support annual Logan passenger volumes of more than 40 million, but use of the airport is only a fraction of that level. This fiscal year, total passengers might hit only 10 million.The outlook continues to trend below a worst-case scenario the authority modeled, and officials now project that traveler numbers will rebound only to about half or two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels by fiscal year 2023.\"That reduction in business activity, if we look at the next three fiscal years, creates a $400 million financial challenge that we will need to solve through a number of options,\" Massport CEO Lisa Wieland said at Thursday's board meeting.",

      "body": "Parents of K-12 students participating in hybrid learning models have a more pessimistic outlook on the impacts of this pandemic-disrupted school year than those whose kids are receiving entirely remote or fully in-person education, a new poll shows.The survey, conducted by the MassInc Polling Group and sponsored by The Barr Foundation, found that around half or more of parents anticipate the current school year will have negative effects on their children's academic learning, mental or emotional health, opportunities for friendships, and social or behavioral skills.Presenting the findings in a webinar Thursday, MassINC Polling Group President Steve Koczela said higher-income and white parents were more likely to perceive negative impacts, and that parents whose kids were attending full-time, in-person school saw more positive impacts.Koczela said the poll of 1,549 parents, conducted from Oct. 16 through Nov. 1 via phone and online interviews in English and Spanish, gauges parents' perceptions rather than assessing student achievement and outcome.With the school year in progress and the COVID-19 pandemic ongoing, it's still an open question what the ultimate learning impacts from various academic models as strategies will be.\"Will it be clear at the end that even though it was a miserable experience for parents, that hybrid really was better?\" Koczela said. \"That's the kind of thing which we don't really know yet. We don't know if it's going to turn out that one of the learning models actually did produce better results, but if we're just listening to parents, there's a lot on their minds.\"Angst about hybrid instruction -- which can involve a \"chaos factor\" from switching back-and-forth between modes and added burdens for parents supervising asynchronous learning -- does not necessarily translate into a desire for more in-person school time, Koczela said.The polling group said that the 28 percent of parents who now say their student is behind grade level is up from 22 percent in May and \"represents a steady rise in concern since before the pandemic, when 13% of parents said their child was behind grade level.\"Across learning modes, the jump in parents concerned their child was falling behind grade level was most pronounced for the hybrid-learning parents, rising to 31 percent from 10 percent pre-pandemic.Most respondents said their children were engaged in remote or hybrid instruction (46 percent each), with 11 percent saying their children were attending entirely in-person school. Some parents answered for multiple children involved in different set-ups.The poll showed \"big, big, big differences\" in which demographic groups are participating in which type of learning, Koczela said.Latino and Black parents with household incomes below $75,000 were the most likely to say their kids were in all-remote schools, while private-school parents and white parents with household incomes above $75,000 were the least likely.\"There is this big divide that I think we're going to be learning a lot more about as time goes on, in terms of what the impacts of this are, but one of the things we wanted to do with the survey is, because there is no official data on this yet, we just wanted to document who is actually doing what, and how does that actually break down,\" Koczela said.Half of respondents said they believed their school district was doing the best it could under the circumstances, and 13 percent said they had children enrolled in a different school than they'd normally attend because of COVID-19. Eleven percent said they hired someone, like a tutor or part-time teacher, to help out because of this year's schooling changes.",

      "body": "Jared Hicks sees a vibrant community and a spot with the potential to add value when he looks out at the vacant parking lot of the former Bayside Expo Center in Dorchester.\u201cIt feels like a neighborhood to me, with the Boston skyline in the background,\u201d he observed during a recent interview with GBH News. Hicks, 29, lives about a 15-minute drive away from the area where the Columbia Point housing project, a shopping mall and the expo center once stood. The 1,300-space parking lot is now a site of competing visions for Dorchester as residents struggle over its future. The conflict has exposed neighborhood divisions along racial and class lines and stoked tensions between homeowners and renters.Once known to draw large crowds to the annual New England Spring Flower Show, the waterside parcel is situated near South Boston\u2019s Carson Beach and the JFK-UMass station on the Red Line. More recently, the prime real estate has drawn interest from developers seeking space in Boston\u2019s hot market.UMass Boston purchased the site for $18 million in 2010. Since then, proposals have been made to build a soccer stadium for the New England Revolution and a village for athletes during the 2024 Summer Olympics.The stadium plan was scrapped after failed negotiations between team owner Robert Kraft and the Boston Teachers Union, which has its headquarters beside the former expo center. Public opposition sunk Boston\u2019s bid for the Olympics.What\u2019s proposed at the site now is a mixed-use redevelopment marketed as a \"catalyst for community transformation\u201d for its potential to generate jobs, improve climate resilience, create multimodal transit pathways and attract other investments to the peninsula. The plan, which includes an adjacent parcel for a total of 33.5 acres, features mainly research and office space, along with 1,740 housing units. Supporters and skeptics agree the proposal, dubbed Dorchester Bayside City, could remake the area, but disagree whether its impact would be positive for the city\u2019s most diverse neighborhood.\"We don't want another Seaport, which is sterile, soulless, lifeless and clearly not meant for current Boston residents,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cThat's a playground for exclusively white and wealthy people, and we don't need that in Dorchester.\"That major redevelopment project had promised to be a place for all Bostonians, but wound up falling far short of that goal.Hicks falls into the crowd skeptical of the Bayside plan \u2014 the mostly Black and Hispanic working-class renters who can\u2019t afford to buy homes and fear the rapid pace of development will eventually run them out of the neighborhood.He and other members of the housing advocacy group Dorchster Not for Sale expressed their concerns during a recent public meeting.By the time Hicks made his comments, though, City Councilor Frank Baker, who represents the area, had heard enough. The two had a tense exchange that has since been replayed on social media. \"To drive home what he was driving home, I just thought he was a little over the top,\" Baker said in an interview with GBH News this week.Baker, a lifelong Dorchester resident and a supporter of the Bayside project, said he \u201cprobably should've just closed my mouth\" that day, but felt compelled to speak on behalf of longtime homeowners in nearby Savin Hill and Andrew Square, who have been consulted closely about this project.The mostly white group, he said, was being mislabeled as exclusive.\"I'd say that's a generalization that plays out over and over and over, insinuating that older white people from this area don't know how to be fair,\" Baker said, pushing back against the idea that the neighborhood\u2019s historical segregation is behind concerns about the project.Baker concedes housing is a top concern, but he says the redevelopment probably isn't the best place to build and sell new homes. Developer Accordia Partners controls the site under the terms of its 99-year lease with UMass Boston. About 25 percent of the square footage is planned for housing. Baker suggested the project has the potential to prompt transportation improvements to a nearby chokepoint rotary, Morrissey Boulevard and the JFK-UMass station. Development plans contain a list of potential improvements, but no firm commitments to execute them.Kirk Sykes, Accordia\u2019s managing partner, said he understands why a community populated mostly by people of color could be concerned about how they can participate in his company\u2019s proposal. He told GBH News that Accordia has \u201can absolute responsibility\u201d to make that participation possible.\u201cI think housing, in a city like Boston, is always a big topic,\u201d he said.Documents from the Boston Planning and Development Agency state the project will follow the city\u2019s policy and make 13 percent of its units affordable. They are to range in size from micro-units to three-bedrooms.Sykes, who identifies as African-American, agrees housing units for rent and for sale are both important to building a vibrant community. But housing concerns, he said, don\u2019t automatically outweigh all others.\u201cI think, one of the important issues that needs to be discussed is the balance between job creation, business opportunities, housing creation and access to the site,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see them all as important.\u201d Sykes said the project could be revised after more public feedback. Hicks and others with Dorchester Not for Sale said they want to see deeply affordable housing units with adequate space for renting families.\"I worry that that's not going to happen, not because people don't want it, or don't mean for it to happen,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut if they're not specifically intentional and laser-focused on the needs of the most vulnerable in the community, the most marginalized, then ultimately, people will not be served.\"If built, the site will cast its shadow on Harbor Point on the Bay, a mixed-income housing complex that rose from the rubble of the Columbia Point project into what many consider to be the nation's first successful redevelopment of public housing.Developers of the old Bayside center told GBH News they plan to reveal more details about their housing strategy next month.

      "body": "People who have the power to fix specific problems harming Black people always want to remind you of how much they care, all that they have done, and why they are offended that you do not appreciate them. Their feelings and intentions trump their impact: Your pain, suffering, and death. This is the path that advocating for Black people will lead you down. It does not matter the issue, we could be fighting for affordable housing or to keep people alive during COVID-19. You have to brace yourself for the hurt feelings and violently defensive responses of people who make it about themselves.In April of 2020, the Black Boston COVID-19 Coalition (BBCC) sent a set of demands to state and local elected officials. They were presented proactively and with a sense of urgency because we knew that Black and Latinx communities were going to disproportionately bear the burden of the novel coronavirus. The best practices in emergency management and public health were clear on what needed to be done to reduce the blindingly-obvious devastation that was looming on the horizon. We demanded a coordinated strategy in Black communities for communication, mobile testing, contact tracing, cleaning of public spaces (including housing developments), and weekly information sharing of cases and deaths by race, ethnicity, neighborhoods, and country of origin.As we awaited the response, we coordinated efforts to distribute information, food, gift cards, masks, cleaning supplies, and any other resources we could muster. We met several times a week to keep everything moving. With volunteers and no funding, we leveraged the collective resources individuals and organizations brought to our table. In the middle of chaos, the deafening silence from elected officials was disappointing, but not unexpected.So, to start, we held a press conference to get a meeting with Mayor Martin J. Walsh. The meeting began with pleasantries and then Mayor Walsh said \u201cWhy do you have to call them demands?\u201d As people were dying, we were discussing a word. We are not supposed to demand anything, we are expected to ask nicely and keep everyone comfortable while we are in excruciating, soul-crushing, and life-ending pain.We also followed up with the governor\u2019s office. No response. So BBCC members showed up at a press conference Gov. Charlie Baker was holding in a predominantly Black neighborhood. There was a meeting scheduled. During the meeting, we expressed major concerns about Partners in Health\u2019s track record. He took the usual defensive posture and vouched for their vast experience in third world countries. To which one of our members responded, our communities are not third world countries. It was clear by the end of the meeting that the engagement was performative. We can tell many stories of people and organizations in the private and public sector with the direct power to address major problems and inequities who instead made it about themselves.It is a sign that our democracy is broken, when your community reaches out to partner with government officials on urgent issues threatening people\u2019s lives and your hand is slapped away. We need leaders who understand that democracy is hard, messy, and necessary; and it is not about them but the communities they swore to serve and the systems and structures they can fix.Now here we are riding the beginning of Wave Three with Black lives again on the line. Once again we know what to expect because of racism: Black people will continue to bear the disproportionate burden of cases and deaths.We are growing our coalition, we are now at over 180 people representing over 60 organizations. Our concerns continue to be:\u00b7 Testing & Contact Tracing: We are still committed to a coordinated strategy for mobile testing and contact tracing.\u00b7 Education: With the pivot to fully remote learning for students, we stand ready to partner with those who can help families with reliable internet access, computers, and support to parents.\u00b7 Resources + Supplies: We are going to continue to fund and distribute gift cards and PPE as well as small stipends to community members, including youth, to help with distribution.\u00b7 Priority Populations: We will continue to advocate for and do wellness checks on our elders, families, and other vulnerable people.This is not a story of victimhood, and it is true that we have experienced attempts to ignore, silence, and fail us. However, we are fighters and will not succumb to the overt and covert ways racism continues to erode the fabric of our city, state, and country through personalizing, inaction, misdirection, and \"worst\" practices.",

      "body": "As a student and multi-disciplinary artist pursuing a master's degree in architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Darien Carr spends a lot of time thinking about what it means to exist in the many spaces we inhabit. He's using those learnings to help conceptualize a new facility for The Record Co., a nonprofit that provides affordable rehearsal and recording space for Boston-based music makers. \"Right now, I'm trying to develop a vocabulary on how architecture and space can address identity,\" Carr tells me. \"It's a deeper concept that confronts what it feels like to have race, gender, and class. When you start to consider that, and how people feel inside spaces, it becomes a topic we don't talk about enough.\"It's a fine line to be walked when the institution says to be there, you have to exist in a specific way. You can't have the culture and ignore the people who are making the culture.In October, Carr wrote an article for NPR Music about the resiliency of Boston's hip-hop community, whose talent has found themselves with fewer performance opportunities due to the pandemic. This is especially true for the city's hip-hop musicians, who historically have been forced to find surrogate spaces to make music and connect with their fans in a city that heavily favors rock acts. But many of the artists Carr spoke with also shared the experience of being invited into spaces to perform, yet not expected to bring their whole selves. It's a level of tokenism that local hip-hop artist Oompa says is \"part and parcel of being a Bostonian, a Black Bostonian... People have the ability \u2014 and they constantly do \u2014 [to] tell you ways that you don't belong in a space,\" she says in the article.\"It's a fine line to be walked when the institution says to be there, you have to exist in a specific way,\" Carr adds. \"You can't have the culture and ignore the people who are making the culture.\"To Carr, hip-hop is much more than just a music genre: \"It also represents a framework of creativity and essentially making it work with what you've got.\" While the ingenuity of this community deserves praise, it's equally essential that the many inequalities it faces are addressed. The Record Co. aims to do just that.A space by and for the communityMatt McArthur was 19 years old and in college when he founded The Record Co. \"I had no clue what I was doing; I just knew that there were a lot of musicians in Boston who didn't have access to recording studios and equipment,\" he says. \"The idea was simple: let's make a space that belongs to no one because it belongs to everyone.\"Over the past ten years, The Record Co. has helped nurture the aspirations of local talent across musical genres, including Cliff Notez, who received six Boston Music Award nominations this year. Anjimile, whose critically-acclaimed debut album Giver Taker released in September via Father/Daughter Records, considers The Record Co. a critical community resource. \"It's one of the few affordable recording studios in the city,\" they tell me. \"I can't wait for them to reopen!\" ModuleDespite an industry-shuttering pandemic, The Record Co. is growing and has spent the last year working with the architecture and design firm Silverman Trykowski Associates to build a larger facility \u2014 a significant upgrade to their current two-room area \u2014 located at 960 Mass Ave. in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood. The new space, which today The Record Co. announced will be opening on Thursday, January 14, 2021, will have 15 rehearsal rooms, four recording studios, workshop training rooms, a meeting lab, a multipurpose room, and the building's largest recording studio will also double as an open community space. \"We thought we were just going to build more performance space,\" McArthur tells me, \"But when we went to the community, they said, 'Actually, we don't need performance space; we need space to rehearse and write.' So we pivoted to build that instead.\" McArthur jokes about parachuting in and telling people what they need, but I know he takes his commitment to this community seriously. For starters, the leadership council at The Record Co. is stacked with musicians and other members of the community it serves. Oompa and artist and producer Tim Hall are among the local music makers who currently hold seats, where they advise, inform, and make decisions alongside the board of directors. From the location to the equipment and everything else that goes into creating a shared workspace \u2014 even including the kind of fabric used for the furniture \u2014 the community is involved every step of the way. It's a strategy tied to the organization's mission to find new and unexplored ways to provide and make space even more accessible. \"People want to participate,\" McArthur says. \"They want to be called in, not called out.\" Renderings of The Record Co. expansion. The facility will open on January 14, 2021.\"This is the test\"Carr was an undergrad when he took an internship at The Record Co. in 2018. \"I was making music, and I wanted to learn more about audio engineering, and I ended up working at the front desk,\" he says. \"I decided that I wasn't going to be an audio engineer, but the experience helped me to pivot to applying to architecture school.\" Carr returned to The Record Co. this year to work alongside Maria Bartolotta, Community Manager at The Record Co., on community-driven design initiatives for the expansion. After the pandemic hit, he pivoted his work to research how local musicians were responding, ultimately focusing on the hip-hop community. \"My first 'wow' moment was when Darien introduced us to the concept of alternative spaces,\" Bartolotta says. \"He also showed us how the hip-hop community has been innovating due to the lack of access they have experienced. When we tie that all back to COVID-19 and what the music community is dealing with now \u2014 creating, distributing, and performing online \u2014 this is something that's not new to them. All of the discrimination they've experienced has equipped them with a special skill set to navigate this better than anyone else.\" For years, Boston hip-hop artists have been using \"second\" spaces, like yoga studios or coffee shops, to perform and make music. Carr learned that while using non-traditional spaces for music may not seem ideal, many actually prefer the approach because it allows them to curate their experience and removes the expectations that traditional venues often place on their work. \"We're not bound to anything,\" hip-hop artist Brandie Blaze says in the NPR Music article. \"We can do whatever we want and have an amazing time.\"Carr says that when institutions place limits on people, it becomes difficult to identify their value. \"But when you're opening your doors to people, and you're like, 'Hey, come in. We aren't going to tell you what to do, just do something that's of value to you,' then an institution becomes an essential part of empowering the community it serves,\" he says. The question is, how will The Record Co. take this DIY experience and use it to create a primary space? \"Well, if that ain't the $6 million question,\" McArthur laughs. \"I think that's the biggest thing we're on the cusp of learning. Taking institutional resources and repackaging them in a way that's useful to non-institutional parties might be our legacy,\" he says. \"This is the test.\"\"We're purposefully like a blank slate,\" Bartolotta adds. \"We provide the space \u2014 and not just the physical space, but the communal figurative space \u2014 for people to form connections and community. That experience will look different for every person because they get to decide what they're going to use The Record Co. for.\"But space is just one of the resources that this community needs. Across all genres, Boston's music makers are also looking for help with marketing, distribution, management, and other professional services to support their work. McArthur says it's impossible to say whether or not these types of resources will ever become a part of The Record Co.'s long-term roadmap. Still, he hopes that those conversations will start within the walls of the new location. The exterior of The Record Co. expansion. Matt McArthur, Executive Director and Founder, says that this is the first time the organization has had storefront space for promotion, and its final design will mirror the community they serve.One of the projects that Carr has been helping with is designing a storefront space for the expansion. He tells me it was a magical moment for him when his research on the hip-hop community intersected with his design intentions. \"Connecting those dots was an exciting part of it for me,\" he says. \"How do you take a space that is traditionally used for advertising and subvert it to develop meaning to that space?\" \"If you ask a signage vendor what should go in the window, they come up with vinyl cut advertisements about all the services we offer,\" McArthur adds. \"But when you ask a member of the community what should be in that window (in the case of Darien's work), what you get is much more abstract and celebratory.\"The final design for the storefront is still coming together, but McArthur says that Carr's research has helped the organization move past the idea of, literally, what should be in the window. \"What should that window represent when we're talking about a community that's never had that point of pride before?\" he says. \"They've never had 500 square feet of space on Mass. Ave in Boston to say something. We don't need to advertise The Record Co. What we need to do is uplift and provide hope for the community that we serve.\"All we need to do is askCarr has two-and-a-half years left in his architecture master's program and tells me that his work at The Record Co. has reinvigorated his desire to understand the many nuanced ways that spaces exist. He plans to explore them through several mediums, including video and making music of his own. \"I'm just really trying to find the maximum amount of avenues to communicate and get ideas and stories out that I think are important,\" he tells me.\"I'm excited to see him make a dent in this space, one that's more human-driven, more community-driven,\" Bartolotta says of Carr. \"He's more aware of so many things that might not be the main focus of other architects.\"\"I learned so much from literally just listening to people and asking their opinions about things,\" Carr replies. \"It's those things that speak to the level of commitment The Record Co. has to this community and the services they will provide once they open up.\" Bartolotta smiles. \"The communication piece, we just take it for granted,\" she says. \"All we need to do is ask. That's all we ever need to do.\"The Record Co. will be opening the doors to its new location on January 14, 2021. They're currently taking reservations online at therecordco.org.",

      "body": "The undercurrent of recent Latin Grammy award presentations has been defined by the push and pull between reggaeton and Latin trap artists, and the Latin Grammy establishment. Last year, not a single urban artist was nominated in the major categories of record of the year, song of the year or album of the year, which prompted a backlash on social media with the quote \"Sin reggaeton no hay Latin Grammys,\" or \"Without reggaeton, there are no Latin Grammys.\" The Latin Academy tried to bridge this divide by adding two reggaeton categories this year, while Bad Bunny, J Balvin and Karol G also each received nominations in general field categories.Rapper Residente, formerly of Calle 13, won Song of the Year for his autobiographical \"Ren\u00e9.\"Mexican pop vocalist-turned-folklorista Natalia Lafourcade won Album of the Year with her homage to Mexican son jarocho music, Un Canto Por Mexico Vol. 1. In fact, Lafourcade won each of her nominations for Best Alternative Song (with iLe, \"En Cantos\") and Best Regional Song (\"Mi Religi\u00f3n\").It was a big night for Alt.Latino favorite and indie singer/songwriter Gina Chavez, who was selected to open the 21st-annual Latin Grammys with a performance during the afternoon presentations (she did not win her nomination for best/Pop Rock album, her first nomination). Alt.Latino also closely followed the recording of Los Tigres del Norte's albumLos Tigres del Norte Live At Folsom Prison which won Best Norte\u00f1o Album.Throughout the night there were brief musical interstitials featuring folk musicians from throughout Latin America, emphasizing the power of music to unite. But the emotional highlight was when vocalist Pitbull took the stage backed by a band made up not of professional musicians, but of professional first responders from around the country.And they rocked it:Full list of winners and nominees:Record of the Year \"China,\" Anuel AA, Daddy Yankee, Karol G Featuring Ozuna & J Balvin \"Cuando Est\u00e9s Aqu\u00ed,\" Pablo Albor\u00e1n \"Vete,\" Bad Bunny \"Solari Yacumenza,\" Bajofondo Featuring Cuareim 1080 \"Rojo,\" J Balvin \"Tutu,\" Camilo Featuring Pedro Cap\u00f3 \"Lo Que En Ti Veo,\" Kany Garc\u00eda & Nahuel Pennisi \"Tusa,\" Karol G & Nicki Minaj \"Ren\u00e9,\" Residente WINNER: \"Contigo,\" Alejandro SanzAlbum of the Year YHLQMDLG, Bad Bunny Oasis, J Balvin & Bad Bunny Colores, J Balvin Por Primera Vez, Camilo Mesa para Dos, Kany Garc\u00eda Aire (Versi\u00f3n D\u00eda), Jesse & Joy WINNER: Un Canto Por M\u00e9xico, Vol. 1, Natalia Lafourcade Pausa, Ricky Martin La Conquista del Espacio, Fito P\u00e1ez Cumbiana, Carlos Vives Song of the Year  \"ADMV,\" Vicente Barco, Edgar Barrera, Maluma & Stiven Rojas, songwriters (Maluma) \"Bonita,\" Juanes, Mauricio Rengifo, Andr\u00e9s Torres & Sebasti\u00e1n Yatra, songwriters (Juanes & Sebasti\u00e1n Yatra) \"Codo Con Codo,\" Jorge Drexler, songwriter (Jorge Drexler) \"El Mismo Aire,\" Edgar Barrera, Camilo, Jon Leone, Richi L\u00f3pez & Juan Morelli, songwriters (Camilo) \"For Sale,\" Alejandro Sanz & Carlos Vives, songwriters (Alejandro Sanz & Carlos Vives) \"#ELMUNDOFUERA (Improvisaci\u00f3n),\" Alejandro Sanz, songwriter (Alejandro Sanz) \"Lo Que En Ti Veo,\" Kany Garc\u00eda, songwriter (Kany Garc\u00eda & Nahuel Pennisi) WINNER: \"Ren\u00e9,\" Residente, songwriter (Residente) \"Tiburones,\" Oscar Hern\u00e1ndez & Pablo Preciado, songwriters (Ricky Martin) \"Tusa,\" Kevyn Mauricio Cruz Moreno, Karol G, Nicki Minaj & Daniel Oviedo Echavarr\u00eda, songwriters (Karol G & Nicki Minaj) \"Tutu,\" Camilo, Jon Leone & Richi L\u00f3pez, songwriters (Camilo Featuring Pedro Cap\u00f3)Best New Artist  Anuel AA Rauw Alejandro WINNER: Mike Bah\u00eda Cazzu Conociendo Rusia Soy Emilia Kurt Nicki Nicole Nathy Peluso Pitizion WosBest Pop Vocal Album  Spoiler, Aitana Prisma, Beret Por Primera Vez, Camilo M\u00e1s Futuro Que Pasado, Juanes WINNER: Pausa, Ricky MartinBest Reggaeton Performance (new category) WINNER: Yo Perreo Sola, Bad Bunny Morado, J Balvin Loco Contigo, DJ Snake & J Balvin Featuring Tyga Porfa, Feid & Justin Quiles Chicharr\u00f3n, Guaynaa Featuring Cauty Te So\u00f1\u00e9 de Nuevo, Ozuna Si Te Vas, Sech & OzunaBest Contemporary/Tropical Fusion Album  Energ\u00eda Para Regalar, El Caribefunk Mi Derriengue, Riccie Oriach Mariposas, Omara Portuondo Alter Ego, Prince Royce WINNER: Cumbiana, Carlos VivesBest Ranchero/Mariachi Album  Antolog\u00eda de la M\u00fasica Ranchera, Aida Cuevas Hecho en M\u00e9xico, Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez WINNER: A Los 4 Vientos Vol. 1 (Ranchero), Eugenia Le\u00f3n Bailando Sones y Huapangos con El Mariachi Sol de M\u00e9xico de Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, Mariachi Sol de M\u00e9xico de Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez AYAYAY!, Christian NodalBest Portuguese Language Song  \"A Tal Can\u00e7\u00e3o Pra Lua (Microfonado),\" Vitor Kley, songwriter (Vitor Kley & Samuel Rosa) WINNER: \"Abric\u00f3-De-Macaco,\" Francisco Bosco & Jo\u00e3o Bosco, songwriters (Jo\u00e3o Bosco) \"Amarelo (Sample: Sujeito de Sorte - Belchior),\" Dj Duh, Emicida & Felipe Vass\u00e3o, songwriters (Emicida Featuring Majur & Pabllo Vittar) \"Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o,\" Russo Passapusso, songwriter (Elza Soares & BaianaSystem Featuring Virg\u00ednia Rodrigues) \"Pardo,\" Caetano Veloso, songwriter (C\u00e9u)  Copyright 2020 NPR.

      "body": "The latest weekly COVID report from the state shows 62 cities and towns in the high-risk \"red zone.\" A month ago, there were nearly twice as many on the map. But that doesn\u2019t mean things are better now. In fact, they\u2019re worse.The apparent reduction in risk is the result of a change three weeks ago in the metric the state uses to determine what communities are considered high risk.The state's new plan says if a city or town stays out of the red for three weeks in a row, they can choose to move into the next step of reopening. And since Thursday's weekly report was the third one using the new metric, 80 cities and towns that were considered high-risk a month ago now qualify to move to that next step of reopening. As COVID-19 cases are spiking across the state, that means those cities and towns could choose to allow greater numbers of people to be in places like performance venues, gyms, museums and libraries.Instead of having a single formula, the new metric breaks cities and towns into three groups by size. There are different thresholds for each group \u2014 including the percentage of COVID tests that come back positive. \"It's misleading,\" said Carlene Pavlos, executive director of the Massachusetts Public Health Association. \"It gives the message to community leaders and community residents that things are getting better when the numbers tell us that they are getting worse.\"Baker says he expects what he calls these more \"nuanced\" metrics to enable more school districts to bring kids back to classrooms. Some educators are pushing back.\"It isn't helpful to abruptly and drastically change the metrics and then on top of that, apply pressure to locals to change the decisions that they made,\" said Merrie Najimy, president of the Massachusetts Teachers' Association. \"Because these local decisions have been made with great consideration, including the teachers. And now schools have to throw everything to the wind to meet the governor's expectations.\"\"You're always going to have a recalibration whenever you change metrics,\" said Dr. Mary Beth Miotto, vice president of the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Like the governor, she and her organization would like to see more schools opening up. Miotto says this is actually a better way of looking at what's really happening in the state.\"We were more conservative, and sometimes people think that's more reassuring, but it ties our hands in ways that sometimes doesn't allow us to do the right thing,\" she said. The new metrics are \"more nuanced data, it's fuller data, more textured than what we had.\"",

      "body": "Winter is coming to the City of Boston. That was the message from Mayor Marty Walsh as he stepped to the podium Friday morning at the city's Public Works Yard for his 8th annual \u201cwinter preparedness\u201d press conference. Standing in front of a massive mound of road salt, Walsh said the city is poised to meet the trials of a unique winter, where the COVID pandemic could prove as formidable a challenge as the most daunting Nor\u2019easter. \u201c2020 is certainly not an average year by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d He said. \u201cBut we have made it a priority in the city to maintain the service level that the residents of Boston deserve and respect.\u201d Walsh addressed issues ranging from snow removal to new COVID-protocols for workers, heating fuel assistance to homelessness \u2013 and, of course, the age-old debate about space savers. CLEARING THE STREETS DURING COVID Walsh thanked the city\u2019s public works employees who he noted \u2013 like groceries store workers, nurses, doctors, and first-responders and\u2013 have been essential employees throughout the pandemic. \u201cOur public works department and our transportation department haven\u2019t stopped one day,\u201d he said. He also acknowledged that their job is poised to get a lot harder in the coming months. \u201cGetting snow and ice off the street is how we keep our city running,\u201d he said.Walsh said that new procedures have been put in place to protect workers during the COVID pandemic, including social distancing guidelines and allowing workers and contractors to start their shifts in the field, rather than gathering in a central location and deploying from there. Walsh also laid out some of the tools at the city\u2019s disposal this winter. Here\u2019s some of that, by the numbers:\u00b7 24: Pieces of new equipment that have been added to the city\u2019s winter fleet \u00b7 150: Total pieces of equipment for cleaning snow and ice in the city\u2019s winter fleet\u00b7 600: Total number of pieces of equipment that can be deployed if needed. \u00b7 45,000: Tons of salt on hand.\u00b7 20,000,000: Dollars allocated for winter preparedness in the city\u2019s budget.THERE\u2019S NO DEBATE ABOUT SPACE SAVERS THIS WINTER The debate among Boston residents about space savers may be an annual tradition, but Jerome Smith, the city\u2019s Chief of Civic Engagement, sought to put to rest any questions about what is and isn\u2019t allowed well ahead of our first big winter storm.\u201cSpace savers in the city of Boston are only to be used when the city declares a snow emergency,\u201d he said.That goes for every neighborhood except the South End, where space savers are not allowed at any time. Smith further clarified that space savers can only be used for 48 hours following the declaration of a snow emergency. At any other time, your orange cone, folding chair, ironing board, or other creative marker \u201cwill be collected during our regular trash collection,\u201d according to Smith.ASK NOT WHAT YOUR CITY CAN DO FOR YOU\u2026Walsh called on all Boston residents, businesses, and property owners to get ready to \u201cdo their part\u201d this winter.\u201cWhen snow does come, the sidewalk in front of your property is your responsibility to shovel and de-ice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking you to do that.\u201dWalsh also asked residents to shovel out nearby fire hydrants and storm drains when possible, and check on neighbors who may be elderly or disabled to make sure they have essentials \u2013 like bread and milk.\u201cHelp shovel out a path in front of their house,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t let them do it.\u201dWalsh noted that the city\u2019s annual winter guide should be mailed out to residents in the next two weeks, and suggested residents stay abreast of developments this winter by signing up for text alerts or visiting boston.gov/snow. HOMELESSNESS THIS WINTERMayor Walsh also addressed the increased dangers that winter brings for those experiencing homelessness.Walsh said that, thus far, the impact of COVID on the city\u2019s homeless population \u201chas not been nearly as bad as was initially feared that it could be,\u201d but also noted that shelters will become busier as the winter weather arrives. Sheila Dillon, Boston\u2019s Chief of Housing, said that the city currently has beds for about 1,200 individuals at various shelters. Working with partners, she expects an additional 200 beds to be added this winter for men, women and children experiencing homelessness. Dillion also called on other communities in the Commonwealth to bring on additional beds for those experiencing homelessness this winter. \u201cA lot of times homeless individuals from other parts of the state come and they look to Boston for services and in years past we\u2019ve been able to provide,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will continue to provide, but it\u2019s harder because we need to keep our shelters at low capacity.\u201dDillon said there are plans to ramp up services for individuals who prefer not to come into shelters, even in frigid winter conditions, including additional outreach vans from Pine Street Inn. \u201cA lot of our homeless are fearful of coming into crowded conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a good job to de-densify the shelters, [but] there\u2019s still a lot of fear.\u201dBoth Dillon and Walsh urged residents to call 3-1-1 or 9-1-1 if they see individuals this winter who appear to be vulnerable or in distress. SERVICES FOR SENIORS Walsh spoke directly to seniors to ensure they are aware of various city services available to them for the coming winter. \u201cWe have fuel assistance, we have home repairs, we can also help you access food and medication delivery,\u201d said Walsh.Housing Chief Sheila Dillon spoke in more detail about a city program the provides financial assistance to eligible seniors to upgrade older heating systems. \u201cNot only do you get close to a free heating system, but you also get help to make sure it\u2019s installed properly,\u201d she said. She encouraged any seniors who have questions or concerns this winter to call 3-1-1. ",

The read or listen to the first part here.As the first chief procurement officer of the University of Massachusetts, David Cho centralized spending across the system's five campuses, giving him the opportunity to analyze the diversity of its vendors.What Cho found in that data earlier this year was admittedly not great. Like most schools, UMass has long said it\u2019s committed to diversity and inclusion, but out of its $1 billion budget, UMass spends 2 percent on businesses owned by people of color.\u201cThe difference between diversity and inclusion is that diversity is being at the party, inclusion is being invited to dance,\u201d Cho said. \u201cThere's a ton more that we can do.\u201dUMass doesn\u2019t yet have any results from Cho's efforts. Advocates say committed leadership from the top can make a difference, but making minority contracting a priority and reaching out to businesses may not be enough. Similar efforts by Emerson College, the Greater New England Supplier Diversity Council and the City of Boston have yielded meager results. The University of Connecticut has earned a regional reputation for minority contracting \u2014 because 6 percent of its spending goes to businesses owned by people of color.Prompted by the national reckoning following the murder of George Floyd, college leaders in Massachusetts say they want to expand their racial equity mission statements to include minority contracting.\u201cI think that folks feel that that is a ready and good tactic to use,\u201d said Rich Doherty, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Massachusetts. Many of its members belong to a statewide co-op that has 2 percent of its active contracts with minority-owned businesses.\u201cThis is a really opportune time to do it with a change in [presidential] administration and just the heightened awareness on campus and in the communities,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever numbers currently exist, we think it's fair to say they're going to expand significantly going forward.\u201dDoherty sees this crisis as an opportunity to spread colleges\u2019 wealth to businesses owned by people of color, first, by raising awareness. \u201cI think it\u2019ll hopefully increase the opportunities for schools to make sure that they're getting a broad range of bidders on their jobs,\u201d he said.The U.S. Supreme Court, though, has limited what colleges can do. If organizations accept federal funds, the court has ruled they can\u2019t reserve contracts for minority businesses to address broad social and economic inequities.One Black-owned business that has had a degree of success in obtaining college contracts, locally and in the Baltimore-Washington area, is WestNet. The Canton-based company, which Gordon Thompson founded in 1992, distributes medical supplies like equipment for life science labs and personal protective equipment.Since March, WestNet has seen a huge demand for PPE, although one school has never contracted with him: Boston University, New England\u2019s largest private school.\u201cI think they just have a different value towards small business and working with diverse business directly,\u201d said Thompson, who\u2019s been chasing a contract with BU practically since he founded his company. A BU spokeswoman would not comment on specific contracts or say how much the university spends on businesses owned by people of color, but added the college says is preparing to launch a supplier diversity program.Harvard already has one. \"The university continues to make efforts to grow this program and increase the level of participation by minority- and women-owned business enterprises (MWBEs) and small businesses enterprise (SBE) in its procurement process,\" a university spokesperson said.At UMass, Cho said he sees a moral obligation and a way to give people of color a greater chance to build wealth by giving them more opportunities. UMass hasn\u2019t announced any targets or goals yet, but it has set supplier diversity requirements for all its bids. \u201cWe've even launched technology, which enables suppliers who register with UMass to self-certify, so that [they can say], \u2018Hey, we are a diverse supplier we\u2019re either veteran-owned or we are [a] Black or brown business,\u201d he said. As the largest public college in the state, Cho says, UMass plans to help lead a statewide initiative to expand minority contracting with colleges. Lee Pelton, president of Emerson College, also intends to urge college leaders in the state to do the same.GBH's Paul Singer and Diane Adame contributed to this report. ",

      "body": "For Ryan Conway, head football coach at The English High School in Boston, there are three football seasons. First, there\u2019s the regular season, followed by the playoffs. Then, every Thanksgiving, there\u2019s a special, one-day season when the English Eagles face their biggest rivals, the Boston Latin School Wolfpack. That game means more to Conway than almost anything, even state titles.\u201cAnd that\u2019s probably the most important to the community at-large, well, to The English High School community,\" he said. \"I would rather beat Latin than win a Super Bowl.\"The two schools that only enrolled boys until 1972 have been meeting on the gridiron every year since 1887. They\u2019ve played in three different centuries, through 23 U.S. presidents, two world wars and a Cold War. Even in 1918, as the world was battling an influenza pandemic but celebrating the end of the Great War, 3,500 watched Latin beat English, 28-0, at Fenway Park in moderate weather. The next day, the Boston Globe reported the score on its front page.1919 Football GameAs movies turned to talkies and TV turned to TikTok, the game has carried on. It\u2019s the longest running continuous high school rivalry in the country, undeterred by the slow, creeping hands of time. That is, until 2020. This year, the win-loss column will be blank as the COVID-19 pandemic has wiped high school football off the fall calendar in Massachusetts.  For everyone connected with both schools, the loss is bigger than just a game. \u201cI think [the game is] a unifier between students of the present day and any graduate who's ever gone through the school at any moment in time,\" said Rachel Skeritt, head of school at Latin and a 1995 graduate. \"So any living graduate has this memory as a seminal tradition.\u201dBack in her day, Skerritt was a member of the pep squad and remembers even then being impressed by the energy around the game and the droves of alums who would show up. \u201cWhen you meet a member of a class from several, several decades ago, this is the often the thing that we refer to and are able to quickly make that connection,\" she said. \"And that means something.\u201dTo Ray Butler, Latin\u2019s head coach, it\u2019s strange to have to skip the annual matchup, which his school leads 82-38-13.\"You know when you do anything that many times in a row, right, it\u2019s gonna obviously have some major significance to a lot of people,\" he said. \u201cYou look at some of the other rivalries that are close to ours in meetings, but they have had gaps in them, they\u2019ve stopped. We\u2019ve never stopped playing this game.\u201dButler compares Latin-English to other classic contests like Army-Navy or Harvard-Yale, where one game between old opponents can make or break a whole year.Like Ahab hunting his white whale, the coach gives a particular focus to the Eagles. He'll sign off emails with a simple mantra: Beat English.BACK COVER 100TH GAME B.jpgFor Roy Thompson, Latin\u2019s quarterback, the intensity is close to Yankees-Red Sox. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we hate each other, but we are passionate, and we really want to win to represent our school,\" he said. Thompson was looking forward to starting in the game at QB for the first time this year and being part of another chapter in the game\u2019s history. \u201cThere\u2019s more disappointment more than anything else\u2026 in not having that same energy in that tradition of 133 consecutive years of playing,\" he said. Ricardo \"RJ\" Santos attends New Mission High School but plays offensive tackle for English through a co-op between the schools. He wanted to go out in his last year of high school with a win against Latin. The game was a centerpiece of his last two Thanksgivings.\u201cThis year, it\u2019s gonna be different,\" Santos said. \"It\u2019s like, there\u2019s gonna be no football, I haven\u2019t had football this whole year, so it\u2019s like I\u2019m really anxious to play football. I\u2019m mad that we\u2019re not able to play this game.\u201dSkerritt said she feels for all the students who are missing out on the traditions around the game, like the half-day before when Latin holds a spirit day to hype the campus and take a rare break from academics. \"It is tough that these small moments are just coming up on the calendar and getting removed from the calendar with some continuity,\" she said. \"And not necessarily knowing when those moments are gonna stop.\"But there\u2019s still hope. Both sides agree they want to try to schedule a game in the spring, when the MIAA has tentatively slotted a makeup season for football. Jack Owens, Latin\u2019s athletic director, says the players are ready.\u201cWhen somebody gives the okay, they\u2019ll play this game,\" he said. \"Hell, they\u2019ll play in a parking lot, anywhere.\u201dOver at English, coach Ryan Conway is willing to do whatever is necessary to make it happen. It's pained him that his players, particularly his seniors, haven't been able to showcase what they've built up to this season.\"I'd play 'em anywhere, it doesn't even matter to be honest with you,\" he said. \"I'd play 'em even at the conclusion of the season, just to play 'em.\"Latin quarterback Roy Thompson is all in on the idea.\u201cBut I definitely think that we would, both schools, jump at the idea to play each other,\" he said. \"Just to get it in. Just because it\u2019s a tradition, you know?\u201dEven if it\u2019s not on a holiday as usual, Ricardo \"RJ\" Santos is game, too.\u201cI would love it. The day of it being on Thanksgiving, I mean, yeah, that\u2019s cool,\" he said. \"But as long as I get to play Latin, I\u2019m fine.\u201dThe field at Harvard Stadium, where Latin and English have met in recent years, will be empty this Thanksgiving. But wherever and whenever the Eagles and Wolfpack meet again, for both sides it will feel like its own holiday.",

      "body": "Governor Charlie Baker nominated Boston Municipal Court Judge Serge Georges to the Supreme Judicial Court last week, adding to another two nominations in recent months. If his nominees are confirmed by the Governor's Council, that will mean Baker has had the virtually unprecedented chance to fill all seven of the court seats. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University law professor and GBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed about the nominations and what they mean for the state's highest court in the coming years. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: We're taking a break from voter fraud and President Trump this week, if you don't mind. Daniel Medwed: I think that's wonderful. Mathieu: Tell us about Judge Georges' background, for starters. Medwed: Sure. So on the one hand, he's a very well regarded trial judge at the district court level. That's a lower trial court in the Commonwealth that handles misdemeanors, less serious felonies and some civil cases. And he's renowned not just for his legal skills \u2014 his acumen \u2014 but also for the generosity of his spirit. He treats everyone in his courthouse with the utmost respect and kindness. He's Haitian-American, hails from Dorchester and went to Suffolk Law School. He has a wealth of practice experience from his days before the bench, including at least a smattering of experience as a criminal defense lawyer in the private sector. Now, on the other hand, it's a little bit of an outside the box pick by Baker because district court judges are seldom, if ever, elevated to the SJC without at least a pit stop at the superior court level \u2014 that's the higher trial court in Massachusetts \u2014 or the Mass appeals court. But I think that's what makes this such a brilliant choice because Georges' experience in the trenches at the Boston Municipal Court will inform the SJC deliberations, make sure that it's not too rarified [or] too much of an ivory tower, which is always a risk for a state supreme court. I also think, for what it's worth, that he'll sail through the confirmation process with the governor's counsel, as will Baker's other nominee this month, Dalila Argaez Wendlandt. Mathieu: So assuming both are confirmed, Daniel, where does that leave the court as a whole right now? Medwed: That's an interesting point. So for one thing, it's the most diverse court in the SJC's 300-plus year history. We'll have three people of color on a seven person court, including our chief justice, an African-American woman named Kimberly Budd. For another thing, it's a very young court. Georges, Budd and Argaez Wendlandt are all in their early 50s and none of the other four justices are older than 61. Given that the mandatory retirement age in Massachusetts is 70, consider this: all seven justices have turned over. The entire court has turned over in the last four or five years, since 2016. But barring some unforeseen circumstance, this group of seven will operate as a collective without a single vacancy for the next decade almost, until 2029. That means it has this very unusual chance to put its stamp on Massachusetts law, and that stamp really has Charlie Baker's fingerprints all over it. Mathieu: If Charlie Baker's fingerprints are all over the court, what does that mean going forward here in terms of future cases, Daniel? Medwed: What I mean, I think, is that these justices very much reflect Baker's approach ideologically. He's no flame thrower, he's no radical and these justices aren't either. They're very talented, bright and thoughtful lawyers, but none of them are very far left of center. He has four former prosecutors on the bench. And even though I mentioned Georges' criminal defense experience, no one on the court is a former public defender, a former civil rights lawyer or anything like that. That's different to some extent from the composition of the court in recent years where former defense lawyers like Geraldine Hines helped play a role in moving the court in a direction that really made it a progressive beacon across the country. Mathieu: We only have 30 seconds here, Daniel, but just to get to the point here, does that mean the court issues more conservative opinions? Medwed: I don't think so. I just see more evolution rather than revolution. I mean, remember, this is the court that first blessed same sex marriage. This is the court that held that it's rational for an African-American teenager to flee the police in Boston given the epidemic of racial profiling. I just don't see dramatic decisions like that in the near term. I see lots of thoughtful, careful decisions that move the ball forward. But as I said, I see evolution, not revolution. ",

      "body": "Legislative leaders are finally deliberating over a final annual budget plan to send to Governor Charlie Baker. Once that's out of the way, attention will return to all the public policy and legislative priorities that lawmakers have been putting off until the last minute. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with GBH News State House reporter Mike Deehan about some of the work lawmakers are trying to cram in during the last month of a two-year session. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: The legislature started off this session in January 2019. It was a very different world then. Almost two years ago, Mike, both Senate President Karen Spilka [and] the speaker of the House Robert DeLeo laid out their priorities at the time. What were those commitments and how many have been honored? Mike Deehan: Well, I looked back at what Karen Spilka, the Senate president, said her priorities were going to be way back in January and February 2019, and she said climate change, public transit, health care costs, prescription drug costs and education funding. So a lot of these sound familiar. And at the time, Spilka said that the time for small ideas and incremental change is over. So, of course, education funding got passed. It was really the only major legislative accomplishment of the first part of the session, and then the bottom fell out of the budget and they can't fund all of the new education funding because of COVID. Everything else on that list is tied up in one of five conference committees where the House and Senate are now supposedly hammering out an agreement so that the public will be able to see what the final legislative package is. But they've supposedly been doing that since August behind closed doors, just in private. And that's where we're at [with] 37 days left of this session. If House and Senate leaders can't get that together, though, it'll all get kicked down the line to late 2021, or even 2022. Mathieu: I want to ask you about the speaker Robert DeLeo, as we were just talking this morning on Morning Edition: when's the last time you rode the T? For some people, it's not since before the pandemic \u2014 I'm one of them \u2014 and when you look back at that time, that was the story of our time. I know the speaker was talking a lot about it. Deehan: Yeah, that was his main priority earlier on in the session, and the House did pass a tax increase bill that would fund the MBTA and a bunch of other transportation projects. But, of course, that got shelved when the Senate never took it up, and then COVID changed the MBTA completely. Now they have no riders and a [bigger] deficit than they had before. DeLeo also, though, he had a big climate change package that is, again, part of these last minute deliberations between the two chambers. So if either leader wants to come out and say, \"I got my priorities done,\" it's going to come in this last month, this 24th month that they've been at it. Mathieu: Because COVID kept this from taking place, right? Deehan: Yes. The second half of this session has been dominated by COVID. Now it's not to say that they haven't been active. Mail-in balloting was not something that they were thinking about earlier on in the session and had to switch to that. All of these relief funds. spending all this federal money, everything COVID that they've been occupied with all this year has really sidelined these other priorities. But now really is the first and only opportunity they'll have to resume talks on these big ticket items that two years ago were the absolute most important things. Mathieu: Is there a chance the legislature could still come up with some compromises, maybe put some new laws on the books on any of these items? Deehan: It could. Again, it's those five conference committees, there are six member committees between the House and Senate. The most talked about one is the police reform bill that we've talked about a lot. The House and Senate, though, they seem pretty intractably locked in a stalemate over how to oversee local police, who's going to be on the oversight board and whether or not to weaken protections police have from civil lawsuits. And honestly, hope is fading that they're going to even reach a compromise on that because the social moment that we had this summer is fading away. So maybe some things will get passed into law, but we might be looking at a busy 2021 because of 2019. Mathieu: You can write the whole story for 2021 already when you consider the momentum that that cause had over the summer. Mike, lastly, how about the economic development bill that was so critical? Both chambers passed their own versions months ago. Deehan: Yeah, this is probably the closest thing to a must-pass piece of legislation that they're dealing with right now, aside from the budget. It's kind of the brightest hope, I'd say. The bill has things like sports betting in it, it has Governor Baker's housing legislation that he's been trying to get passed for years and years. But it's important to note that all those other big priorities \u2014 climate, transportation, patient health care, prescription drugs \u2014 they're in those lesser hoped for conference committees. So economic development could get done; that's a lot of money going to a lot of different places. But when it comes to big reshaping policy, hope is dimming that real compromises between Democrats in the House and Democrats in the Senate are going to get done this year. ",

Federal and state officials are asking everyone to stay home this Thanksgiving, as public health experts worry that holiday gatherings could result in a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases. Christopher Gill says ordinarily, his family would host a big Thanksgiving dinner.\"We'd have like 20 people, and we'd cram them all in, and my wife and I would spend two days cooking solid,\u201d Gill said. \u201cAnd this year, I think it's just going to be the four of us.\"Gill's taking this seriously because he knows a thing or two about pandemics. He's an infectious disease expert at the Boston University School of Public Health. If people just go ahead and gather around the dinner table with their usual Thanksgiving crew, he said, the spike in cases is going to be significant.\"I think there's no way to make this safe,\u201d Gill said. \u201cYou know, there's just no way. So Thanksgiving's got to be small this year.\"That's the plan for Vonzelle Johnson of Dorchester. Usually, she'd host sisters, brothers, cousins and all their kids for dinner, and then make the rounds of other relatives\u2019 houses. But this year, COVID-19 hit close to home.\"I have a brother who actually caught it, and we had to do a lot of praying and stuff for him while he was up there in the hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cHe's still dealing with it, but he's at a rehabilitation home. They're trying to get him strong and walking again and to breathe on his own at the moment.\u201dThats where he will be Thursday instead of spending Thanksgiving at her house, she said.\"He's missing his family big time, like we're missing him,\" she said.Ruth Zakarin of Sharon is also forgoing a big family get-together this year. Ordinarily, she and her family would visit relatives in New Jersey and New York. They\u2019re staying home, but will still see some friends.\"We have decided to have Thanksgiving in our garage and open up the garage doors and put a table for the four of us who live in my home, and a separate table for a couple \u2014 our friends \u2014 and have a platter of food at each table,\" she said.It\u2019s hard not seeing family for the holiday, Zakarin said.\u201cWe're doing it for the right reasons and to keep everybody safe, so it's the right thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it's strange that we haven't seen our parents \u2014 or the kids haven't seen their grandparents \u2014 in a really long time.\u201d Megan Quinlan said she wishes she\u2019d thought to have an early Thanksgiving with relatives outdoors a few weeks ago while it was still warm out. She\u2019s a school nurse at Reading Memorial High School.\u201cWe are really concerned that we're going to see a spike in the schools two weeks after Thanksgiving,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the transmission has been within families.\u201dQuinlan said she\u2019s heard many families are still planning on getting together.\u201cSo we are really preparing for having a lot of people out,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at that point, we may have to close schools because we just don't have the staff if everybody's quarantining.\u201d For college students, Thanksgiving can be a good long weekend to head back home, rest up before finals, and eat a lot. But most universities are asking students not to travel.Boston University senior Doran Kim isn\u2019t headed home to Chicago. But she\u2019s OK with that.\u201cIn all honesty, a lot of people in my generation, a lot of kids I know, they're not super pro-Thanksgiving,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people, I think, in my friends circles and kind of a liberal, young demographic, see Thanksgiving as a celebration of stolen land more than anything.\u201dAlso, Kim said she spent five months with her family after being sent home at the start of the pandemic in the spring, and she\u2019ll see them again for the upcoming winter break. What's usually a nice holiday has been the source of a lot of anxiety this year. \"I'm probably hearing about Thanksgiving almost every hour in my clinical practice,\" said Anne Fishel, a clinical psychologist and family therapist at Massachusetts General Hospital.Fishel has some advice for those who are still suffering over how to break the news that they\u2019re not coming.\"Maybe talk about how disappointed you are and how much you love them and wish that you could be together and you are already looking forward to next year  \u2014 only if these things are true. But I think they often are,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that many families are worried that this could be a permanent disruption. And so maybe reassuring family members that this is just a sabbatical year. This is just a gap year.\"A lot of families say they\u2019re planning on getting together virtually this year. Zoom has lifted its usual time limit for video calls on Thursday. But to Wendy Murphy of Belmont, that\u2019s just not what the holiday is about.\u201cYou can\u2019t do any of the Thanksgiving stuff by Zoom,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou can\u2019t enjoy the scents. You can't enjoy the music in the same way. You can't sit down and watch a football game together. You can't do anything that matters through Zoom. So I'm going to protest against Zoom, just for Thanksgiving.\u201d She\u2019s sticking with the biggest tradition of the holiday \u2014 cooking a turkey \u2014 even though this year there will only be one person at dinner who eats it.\u201cI'm a vegetarian, but I am cooking that damned turkey,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I'm going to have to give up so much this year. My kids are giving up so much this year. We refuse to give up the smell of that turkey cooking in this house.\"This year, even cooking a turkey can feel like an act of defiance. While next Thanksgiving, hopefully,  will be an easier one, with normal traditions restored, some losses are permanent. Amanda Twaddle of Hudson, New Hampshire will have two empty seats at the table this year. Her husband's father died in May from cancer. And three weeks later, her husband's aunt died of COVID-19.\u201cWe may put an empty plate just to signify that we know we're missing people,\u201d she said. \"I've just ordered a couple of bottles of a wine that she would bring up, so we'll have a toast. Sort of a \u2018wish you were here.\u2019\u201d Even in tough years, Twaddle said, holidays need to be celebrated. And they do have a lot to be grateful for, she said.\"So I think when we sit down for that Thanksgiving meal, it will be in celebration of what we do have,\u201d Twaddle said. \u201cIt will be an acknowledgment of what we've lost. But, you know, we're all safe, thank goodness. We\u2019re all are doing everything we can do to keep each other safe. And we take it one day at a time.\"That, she says, has been the lesson of 2020.",

      "body": "As the U.S. wades deeper into a brutal fall surge of the coronavirus, Americans are living under a growing list of restrictions aimed at curbing the exponential rise of COVID-19.They come in all shapes and sizes. California has resorted to a curfew. Other states \u2014 including Oregon and Washington \u2014 have moved to partial lockdowns, shuttering sectors of the economy and limiting social gatherings. Quite a few states are trying to find a middle ground that staves off the economic pain of closing businesses altogether and ordering people to stay home. But given the unrelenting advance of the virus, can these varied approaches make a difference? Or is it delaying the inevitable return to the sweeping lockdowns of the springtime?\"It's really hard to slow it down once it gets going like this,\" says Don Milton, professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. \"That's when these awful draconian measures come into play.\"The Trump administration has reiterated that any kind of national lockdown is off the table. A top advisor to President-elect Joe Biden has even pushed back on using the term \"lockdown\" to describe what many states did during the spring and has indicated that would be too heavy-handed a response. So for the dark weeks ahead, the scattershot approach to the pandemic \u2014 where each state or region is left to sort out the trade-offs \u2014 will likely define the U.S. public health response.   \"We're going to see a sputtering of shutdowns in the same way that we saw only haphazard shutdowns in March, April and May,\" says Dr. Michael Mina, a professor at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, who has advocated for a nationwide rapid testing program. \"My concern is this is going to lead to the worst of all options, where we're going to have massive economic destruction and the virus is barely going to be dented at a national level.\" Lockdowns work \u2014 but at a priceTo see a place that's returned to strict lockdown, look to New Mexico.  Calling it a \"matter of life and death,\" Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ordered residents to shelter-in-place on Nov. 16, and closed all \"non-essential\" businesses for two weeks (this does not include big box retailers). Broad lockdowns do work as a measure of last resort, says Ana Bento, an assistant professor at the School of Public Health at Indiana University. It's the simplest, most blunt tool to break the chain of transmission, which reduces the probability of people getting infected and lightens the load on the health care system. \"That's the whole purpose of it,\" Bento says. Much has changed since the spring, but evidence shows those lockdowns were quite effective.For example, Delaware's stay-at-home order dramatically changed the course of the state's outbreak, after being implemented in mid-April. That policy decision, along with a mask mandate and contact tracing, led to an 88% reduction in COVID-19 hospitalizations and a 100% drop in mortality from late April to June, according to a recent CDC analysis.Another study found that, in many places, shelter-in-place orders and closing restaurants, bars and entertainment venues, did substantially slow the spread of the virus. \"The lockdown as a strategy, if implemented absolutely correctly, in an ideal utopian world, would be very effective,\" says Bhramar Mukherjee, professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. But aggressive lockdowns crush the economy and are tremendously difficult to sustain without a well-coordinated national strategy and a strong safety net. \"What we learned from April is that blanketed, blind lockdowns cannot be withstood for a long period of time,\" says Bento. \"People get fatigued and they get desensitized about the risks.\" A major shortcoming of the U.S. spring approach was not only the patchwork of different policies, but also that restrictions were relaxed too quickly in many places. And many states did not have enough testing and contact tracing in place to stomp out outbreaks that lead to wider community spread, according to a recent modeling study.   Ultimately, the decision to shut down parts of the economy is political and hinges on how much disease and death states are willing to tolerate. Parts of the Midwest and West have reached staggering per-capita rates of infection, yet have not gone into lockdowns or substantially curtailed businesses. Some governors have vowed not to go there. What else works? A surgical approach based on local data In many states, there is hope that dialing up targeted restrictions can avert broad shutdowns and in some places that may be feasible.The targeted approach is not easy to pull off, either.Ideally, the restrictions are coordinated, based on local data gleaned from contact tracing that show when and where most people are getting infected in that region, Bento says.\"The goal is to do it surgically with the least economic and social pain,\" says Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases at the Yale School of Public Health. Gonsalves says there is no \"boilerplate\" list of restrictions to avert a full lockdown, but there are obvious places to start, like businesses that lead to people crowding inside together for long periods of time.  He says states that have scaled up testing and kept the virus in check are in a better position to quell the rising case numbers, but, in other parts of the country, these more circumscribed strategies can falter. \"For places in the Midwest and the Upper Plains where the virus is sort of everywhere, it's going to be very hard to use testing to target our interventions,\" Gonsalves says. Lacking local data, communities can learn from research and the experience of their neighbors. Here's what research and experts say about the effectiveness of common restrictions and mandates. Mask mandates: There's unanimous support for these among researchers. It's clear that such mandates curb the growth of the virus, and even some governors, such as Iowa's and North Dakota's, who spent much of the pandemic refusing to issue one, have relented as their hospitals near crisis. More than a dozen states still don't have universal face mask mandates.Curfews: Experts have mixed views on these. In states like New York and Massachusetts, late-night curfews are aimed at the most high-risk settings, including restaurants and bars. Much of California is now under a curfew between 10 pm and 5 am. State health officials said that will cut down on nighttime social activities, when people let their guard down and may spread the virus. Ohio's curfew baffled some public health experts: \"I haven't met a single public health official who thinks these types of curfews/10pm shutdowns will be particularly helpful,\" tweeted Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, in reaction to Ohio's curfew.This kind of curfew may help bring down cases in the short-term, says Indiana University's Ana Bento, but would need to be in place long-term to truly decrease transmission.Limits on gatherings. Research shows superspreading events play an outsized role in the transmission of the coronavirus, including weddings, funerals, choir practices and other similar communal events. Some states, especially those that have resisted closing businesses, have enacted measures limiting the size of such gatherings or banning them outright.  And some have left in exceptions that appear to contradict their other policies. Indiana has exempted religious services from its rule on crowd limits, even though multiple outbreaks have been linked to places of worship. Closing (or limiting capacity) at restaurants and bars. This appears to be the \"single, most effective social distancing order,\" according to preliminary research from Harvard and Google.  Another study found that reopening full-service restaurants was \"particularly risky,\" along with fitness centers and places of worship. Using cell phone location data from the Chicago area, the researchers showed that capping maximum occupancy at 20% in these most high risk settings could cut down new predicted infections by 80%. But some experts say limiting the numbers of people is probably not enough when people are indoors, where the risk of catching the virus goes up substantially. \"We should certainly shut down restaurants and bars first before anything else,\" says Don Milton, \"Not just cutting back, but shutting them down.\"Closing down K-12 schools. This is a particularly contentious measure. Recent research suggests that schools are not leading to large outbreaks as initially feared and may be able to stay open safely, but there are still substantial risks if there is rampant community spread. After keeping schools open for a fraction of students, New York City has again halted in-person learning because the city has surpassed a COVID positivity rate of 3% \u2014 a threshold agreed upon by the teachers union when schools restarted. Perils of the scattershot approachFor all these restrictions, says Bento, there could be \"race to contact\" when the policies are relaxed and people are eager to start interacting again.\"While these work short-term, if they aren't implemented for a long enough time to truly decrease transmission, once they are relaxed there will be a rebound of cases,\" she says.With the virus spreading at record speed, it's still far from clear that even data-driven, tailored approaches will work, given the enormous reach of the virus and the coming holiday travel season.Ultimately it's like there's a fire raging, but you're only able to douse the spot fires and wait for help.\"We are putting out fires as they happen,\" says Bento. \"This is not a long term solution.\" She and other experts say what's really needed is widely accessible rapid testing, a robust system of contact tracing and eventually the vaccine.  There is progress on some of these fronts, but the pandemic is moving at a breathtaking pace and the health care system is already starting to buckle under the growing number of patients. Some public health experts say the U.S. may not be able to afford to wait for those interventions to be ramped up.  \"I do think a shelter-in-place order is probably what we really need right now,\" says Columbia University epidemiologist Jeffrey Shaman.NPR's Nurith Aizenman contributed to this report.This story was published as part of a partnership with Kaiser Health News.

No crush of customers savagely competed for door-buster deals, not in a pandemic where distance and order have become the norm when shoppers venture into brick and mortar stores.Jon Hurst from the Massachusetts Retail Association says most stores were well under their 50 percent capacity limit the morning of Black Friday. Hurst says shoppers that want to patronize local stores this holiday season should come in on weekdays to limit exposure and to help out store owners whose sales have dropped because of the virus.Retail sales this year have dropped between 25 and 50 percent, even though nearly double the number of smaller retailers have adopted online shopping options.\"I don't think we can repeat enough the importance that we need to shop when jobs depend on it because they do. And, you know, a lot of these small businesses, a lot of them are hurting,\" Hurst said.Hurst says the number of local retailers offering online sales has almost doubled since March and consumers should consider spending local this holiday season. \"Where we invest our dollars, our consumer dollars, does have an impact on our main streets and our shopping districts. And, you know, we need to keep that in mind as we make some of our purchases,\" Hurst said.",

      "body": "When COVID-19 restrictions reduced his work schedule, Sam Smith turned to another time-consuming task: applying to medical school.He\u2019d always wanted to go into medicine, Smith said. But what was happening in the world had a big impact on the kind of medicine he hopes to practice. Now, Smith said, he wants to specialize in infectious diseases. The experience of the last year \u201cmakes me think, there\u2019s probably going to be another pandemic\u201d in the future, said Smith, 25, who has an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder and moved to Somerville, Massachusetts when his girlfriend started Harvard Law School. \u201cSo I want to be on the front lines of the next one.\u201d Even as college and university enrollment overall has dropped this fall, Smith is part of a wave of what officials say is an all-time record number of applicants to medical school.The number of medical school applicants is up 18 percent this year over last year, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, or AAMC, driven by the example of front-line medical workers and high-profile public health figures such as Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Renewed attention to inequities in the delivery of health care has also played a role.\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said Geoffrey Young, the AAMC\u2019s senior director for student affairs and programs, who compares it to the response to another traumatic moment in American history: the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\u201cAfter 9/11, there was a huge increase in the number of men and women that were entering into the military,\u201d Young said. \u201cSo far in my lifetime, at least, and for as long as I\u2019ve been in medical education, that\u2019s the only comparison that I could make.\u201dThe Stanford University School of Medicine reports a 50 percent jump in the number of applications it received this year over last year, or 11,000 applications for 90 seats. New York University\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine says it\u2019s seen a 4 percent increase, but that comes on top of a 47 percent rise last year after the medical school made tuition free; this year, it has more than 9,600 applications for 102 spots. The Boston University School of Medicine says applications are up 27 percent, to 12,024 for about 110 seats. \u201cWhat\u2019s been happening this year is that more of the people who had at some point thought about medical school decided to stick with it,\u201d said Dr. Kristen Goodell, associate dean of admissions at the BU School of Medicine. \u201cAnd that, I think, may have a lot to do with the fact that people look at Anthony Fauci, look at the doctors in their community and say, \u2018You know, that is amazing. This is a way for me to make a difference.\u2019\u201d Medical school admissions officers have come up with a name for this. They call it the \"Fauci Effect.\"Ryan Chahal, who is also applying to medical school, is among those inspired by Fauci, he said. \"There definitely was a Fauci Effect for me,\u201d said Chahal, 25, who lives in Tampa, Florida. \u201cPeople who are interested in medicine are interested in evidence and evidence-based approaches to things, and he has been very evidence-based.\u201dFauci said he\u2019s gotten hundreds of letters from people telling him they want to practice medicine. It\u2019s \u201cvery flattering,\u201d he said in an interview via Zoom with GBH News. \u201cI think probably a more realistic assessment is that, rather than the Fauci Effect, it\u2019s the effect of a physician who is trying to and hopefully succeeding in having an important impact on an individual\u2019s health, as well as on global health. So if it works to get more young individuals into medical school, go ahead and use my name. Be my guest.\u201d Among other reasons admissions officials cite for the increase in prospective medical school students is that the pandemic has given many people more free time to complete the arduous application process.Normally, before applying to medical school, nearly half of all applicants first spend a year or two after college working, traveling, doing research, pursuing master\u2019s degrees or volunteering, Young said. But this year, \u201ca lot of the plans they made post-grad honestly fell through,\u201d said Dr. Sahil Mehta, founder of MedSchoolCoach, which prepares students for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT).\u201cWe saw a lot of students who said, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m going to apply this year,\u2019\u201d Mehta said. \u201cMaybe they were on the fence and they saw what was happening. They saw that health care workers were really at the forefront of trying to solve this. It really lit a fire under people.\u201dWhen the dermatology practice where she was working as a medical assistant shut down temporarily because of COVID-19, Mary Grace Kelley had the chance to retake the MCAT, and she significantly improved her score.\u201cThis is a perfect time of no distractions,\u201d said Kelley, 23, who lives in the Boston suburb of Natick and is applying to medical schools this year from her childhood bedroom in her parents\u2019 house, which is decorated with team photos and varsity letters from her time as an undergraduate Division I hockey forward. \u201cI\u2019m not very good at sitting still.\u201d DSC_1896.jpgSome institutions also waived the requirement that applicants submit results from the MCAT, which canceled several test dates in the spring. Stanford, which is among the schools that made the MCAT optional, reports that 5 percent of applicants did not submit a score.Medical schools have received so many applications that admissions officers \u2014 many of them working remotely \u2014 are struggling to keep up with the volume. \u201cMy mailbox is almost full with emails apologizing for the delays,\u201d Chahal said. \u201cThey\u2019ve just had a huge number of applications.\u201dThis deluge comes as the nation faces a projected shortage of physicians, and its aging population is requiring more specialty care.The United States will be short 54,100 to 139,000 physicians by 2033, the AAMC estimates, while the proportion of people who are over 65 is expected to grow by 45 percent. More than two out of every five doctors now practicing will reach retirement age in the next 10 years.Already, there are fewer primary care providers than is needed \u2014 internal medicine doctors, family physicians and pediatricians \u2014 in nearly 7,200 areas of the United States with a combined population of roughly 82 million people, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Thirty-five percent of registered voters in a survey last year said they\u2019d had trouble finding a doctor, up from 25 percent in 2015. The bad news for the surge of applicants is that medical schools aren\u2019t likely to expand to accommodate them next fall, meaning that the odds of getting in this year will be much lower than usual. \u201cIt\u2019s discouraging a little bit, to be honest,\u201d Smith said. And while 30 new medical schools have been accredited since 2002 \u2014 bringing the total to 155 and increasing enrollment by 33 percent \u2014 there has been almost no increase since 1997 in Medicare payments for residency training, which costs an average of $171,855 per year, leaving hospitals to either limit the number of residents or cover the cost themselves.Medical school graduates finish with a staggering $241,560 of student loan debt, on average, according to the latest available data from the National Center for Education Statistics, discouraging many would-be doctors, including those from low-income and ethnic and racial minority groups.Eight percent of medical students are Black and 7 percent are Hispanic, both proportions smaller than their share of the population. (Ten percent of medical students identify themselves as multiracial.) \u201cI do think that the debt probably scares off some people,\u201d said Goodell, who is also a former chair of the Council on Graduate Medical Education.Managed health care and more red tape and bureaucracy have also soured some people on careers in medicine, said Mehta, a practicing radiologist. \u201cThat really started to disenfranchise the ways physicians practiced medicine. They were getting burned out,\u201d he said. This year\u2019s many medical school applicants appear undeterred, however.\u201cEveryone feels some sort of responsibility,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cWe are basically the next generation. We\u2019re going to be taking care of our parents, grandparents. So there\u2019s definitely a call to arms thinking that, if there\u2019s another pandemic, it\u2019ll be up to us.\u201d Mehta expects the trend to continue.\u201cGiven that about 60 percent of people [applying this year] won\u2019t get in, you\u2019re probably only going to see an increase in competitiveness next year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bigger thing is you now have people who are freshmen in college, sophomores in college, juniors in college, or even in high school, who for the last few months have been watching Dr. Fauci on TV and thinking, \u2018Maybe this is for me.\u2019 \u201dFauci said he sees the flood of medical school applicants as a sign that people are thinking about social justice \u2014 \u201cthat you have responsibility not only to yourself, but as an integral part of society,\u201d he said. He added that he hopes the trend will counterbalance and \u201cmaybe would even overcome the other side of the coin, which is the really somewhat stunning and disturbing fact that people have no regard at all for society, only just focusing very selfishly on themselves.\u201d This story about medical school applications was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education, in collaboration with GBH News.",

      "body": "With a new Netflix documentary bringing renewed attention on the case of Sean Ellis, Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins says she plans to re-examine the case. \u201cThis is not the last time you'll hear me speaking about Sean Ellis,\u201d Rollins said on Greater Boston Monday, \u201cAnd I'm confident that won't be the last you hear from this office about what it is he's done or who it is he will hopefully become.\u201dEllis was convicted in 1995 for the murder of Boston Police Detective John Mulligan, two years and two hung juries after Mulligan\u2019s death outside of a Wallgreens in Roslindale. Ellis spent 22 years behind bars, serving a life sentence, until a Boston judge ruled that \u201cjustice was not done\u201d and overturned the conviction. Ellis was released in 2018. After the Netflix documentary \"Trial 4\" shed new light on the case, Ellis\u2019 defense attorney, Rosemary Scapicchio, called on Rollins to fully exonerate Ellis. \u201cI think she could. I don't know if she will, but I think she could, based on all of the evidence that's been developed in this case,\u201d Scapiccio told GBH News earlier this month. \u201c[Rollins could] give Sean the opportunity to not be a convicted felon, to go and live the rest of his life as the person that he is, and not drag that ball and chain around with him on this gun conviction.\u201d ModuleIn Ellis\u2019 first trial, the then-19-year-old Black man was accused of possession of a firearm, but the trial resulted in a hung jury and a mistrial. The second trial resulted in the same thing, because the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. Ellis was convicted of armed robbery and first-degree murder, and then a judge granted a motion for a new trial. \u201cWhatever will be filed with us, we will consider whether there is a motion for a new trial on the gun,\u201d Rollins said. At the time of his death, Mulligan was being investigated for both internal policy violations and crimes including the armed robbery of a suspected drug dealer. A 1996 report by the Boston Globe\u2019s Spotlight team revealed that Mulligan\u2019s colleagues, Detectives Kenneth Acerra, Walter Robinson, and John Brazil were involved in corruption schemes including falsifying search warrants, demanding bribes including money and drugs, and extorting additional payments by not showing up to scheduled court appearances. Acerra\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s niece, Rosa Sanchez, also served as a key witness during Ellis\u2019 trial. \u201cThis case has a lot of very glaring constitutional violations that have occurred.\u201d Rollins said. \u201cWe need to look at some of these officers that were dirty, quite frankly, and see what other cases they might have touched.\u201d",

      "body": "The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will hear the investigation brought by Attorney General Maura Healey into Facebook and how the company shares data. The hearing comes two years after news broke that an app developer had misappropriated data from millions of Facebook users and sold it to a company called Cambridge Analystica for use in the 2016 Presidential Election, which led to a flurry of investigations into whether other bad actors had gained access to private data from Facebook. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University and GBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed to discuss the case. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: What led to this dispute between Facebook and our attorney general's office? What is this really about? Daniel Medwed: So here's the back story. After that Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Facebook hired a number of outside lawyers to conduct an internal investigation into whether there were other potential security breaches \u2014 had other app developers similarly misused consumer data? Simultaneously, the Massachusetts attorney general's office was concerned that these security breaches could imperil Massachusetts residents. So they started their investigation, and they asked for help from Facebook. Specifically, they wanted information about the identity of the app developers that this internal investigation by outside lawyers happened to be targeting. Facebook balked; they didn't want to turn over this information, citing the attorney-client privilege because of the involvement of these outside counsel, and also something known as the work product doctrine, which shields information that's developed in anticipation of litigation. Complicated technical back story, but it goes to an important public policy point: to what extent may the government get access to company information and data to right a public wrong when that information and data was produced, in part, by lawyers? That's really the issue. Mathieu: OK, how did it get all the way to the SJC, though? Did a judge or a court ever allow the attorney general to access the info? Medwed: Yes, so here's the scoop. The AG's office filed what's called a civil investigative demand, or CID, with Facebook asking for a whole bunch of information. Facebook largely complied, except for all of this material concerning the internal investigation. That led the AG to request an order to compel compliance, and they filed that petition with the Superior Court, which is the Massachusetts trial court. And a superior court judge basically agreed with the AG and ordered Facebook to turn over this material. Facebook did not want to comply, so they sought an appeal. And now we're with the SJC. Mathieu: So Facebook is claiming that this internal investigation generated protected information. What's the AG's legal argument that her office then should have access to it? Medwed: Well, it's basically a two part argument. First, that Facebook failed to establish that the outside counsel investigation qualifies as work product \u2014 that this really wasn't done in anticipation of litigation, but it was more of a PR campaign to assure a wary public that Facebook's platform was safe. In fact, Facebook publicized a lot of these internal investigative findings. Second, and relatedly, the AG is claiming that the attorney-client privilege doesn't apply. It's very narrow. The privilege only protects confidential communications that are made for the purpose of rendering legal advice. And according to the AG's office, this internal investigation was wide ranging, it was made public and exceeds the scope of the attorney-client privilege. Mathieu: Any thoughts, I have to ask, on how the SJC might rule? Medwed: I'm not entirely sure. On the one hand, I think we need a robust, vibrant attorney-client privilege to protect all of us \u2014 not just big corporations like Facebook \u2014 from the far reaching hand of the government that could intrude on our privacy. We need to have the privilege. But on the other hand, we don't want companies to hide information that the government could use to right a really important public wrong simply because some lawyers were involved in generating it. For what it's worth, the Superior Court judge did side with the attorney general's office way back when, and sometimes the SJC defers a little bit to those lower court decisions. So we'll just have to wait and see. ",

      "body": "The Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate have reached a compromise on a police reform bill, which establishes new oversight for police in the state and puts restrictions on how they can use force. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with GBH News Statehouse reporter Mike Deehan to get details about what's in the bill and whether Governor Charlie Baker will sign it into law. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: We've been talking about this for a long time. This has been sitting on the shelf for months, having been a major story during the spring and summer months; five months now to come up with a compromise. What are the key points? What made it through the end? Watch: Deehan on the key points of the police reform bill:Raw HtmlMathieu: Qualified immunity was a big point of contention between the House and Senate, Mike. It's something that a lot of people have learned a lot about over the last year. Where did the compromise land there? Deehan: Well, the House did win on that one. The major contention when the House and Senate were debating their various proposals was to do what the Senate wanted, which was really restrict qualified immunity \u2014 that's the protections against civil lawsuits that police have. The Senate wanted to really restrict those, roll them back. The House decided to tie it to the decertification, so that immunity stays unless a police officer is decertified by this new board. So that's a higher standard for that kind of punishment. That's what got a lot of advocates excited, a lot of police union activity. They were lobbying hard throughout those five months during these negotiations. So that is kind of where QI lands. There is, I guess, a silver lining if you're the Senate in that the bill will start a commission to review that qualified immunity debate and they'll file recommendations with the legislature next September. So I guess we'll just have to see if there's still an appetite to make further reforms to that particular piece of the pie. Mathieu: So are you indicating that negotiations were ongoing this whole time while we were talking about it, Mike, or did something kick this loose again more recently? Deehan: They're so tight-lipped about these types of things; it's very difficult to say what was going on over these five months and if something was in fits and starts. But it's well known that police unions, civil rights activists and other groups were very, very active in pitching to their lawmakers, not only the lawmakers that were on this six-member conference committee between the House and Senate that was debating the bill, but also the rank and file members that are going to have to approve this package when it comes through. It should be noted that this was one of the closest House votes in years. It was something like 99 to 60, which seems like a pretty solid majority, but it never gets that close. Meaning that if the House were to soften some of their positions, they'd probably lose votes and they probably wouldn't have that veto-proof majority should Governor Baker decide to veto this. So there was not a lot of leeway for the House to give up anything, and I think that's why we saw a lot of the language in this compromise bill reflect what the House wanted instead of what the Senate did because they just knew that votes would drop off and that could jeopardize the whole thing if they couldn't get it through the House of Representatives. Mathieu: So how about the governor, Mike Deehan? Is he expected to sign this or are you waiting to hear from his office? Deehan: It has an awful lot of what Governor Baker asked for, not only in that POST board \u2014 that was a key part of his initial police reform bill that he filed months and months ago. It has a lot of the reforms to the state police that Baker had wanted. That's something that whenever this comes up, he reminds the legislature and lawmakers that he needs to get those state police reforms in. So there's a lot for him. There's not a ton that he would be that resistant about. Maybe the membership of the board isn't quite to his liking [or] maybe too many civilians than he would like. However, the main pieces are in alignment with what Baker wanted, it's in alignment with what the Black and Latino Caucus wanted, and it seems like Baker shouldn't have too much of a problem signing this one.

      "body": "The COVID-19 vaccine that was dreamed up and developed by Massachusetts-based Moderna will also be manufactured in the state.\"The vast majority of the U.S. production will be done in Massachusetts,\" Moderna co-founder Noubar Afeyan told GBH News. Afeyan is the founder and CEO of Flagship Pioneering, a biotech venture capital firm that founded Moderna and more than 50 other life science and technology startups. Moderna applied this week for emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine from the Food and Drug Administration. With an up-front purchase agreement from the federal government, Moderna is already producing the vaccine at its own production facility in Norwood, Mass. Moderna has also partnered with contract manufacturer Lonza, which is producing the vaccine at a facility in Portsmouth, N.H.When the pandemic hit, Afeyan said, Moderna was able to move quickly to ramp up research and production.\"We were able to attract hundreds of people in the middle of a pandemic to join the company \u2014 beyond the people we already have \u2014 so we could ramp up production,\" Afeyan said. \"I don't know where else you can do that. You might be able to do that in little pockets here and there. But Boston, Massachusetts is, I would argue, the only place where this could have been developed.\"The biotechnological innovation behind Moderna's vaccine has been the company's focus for roughly a decade: programming messenger RNA to trigger a person's immune system into producing antibodies. \"We recognized that if we could somehow make a molecule that could essentially have a code for any protein we wanted, and put that into a patient or a subject safely, so that their own cells could convert that into a protein . . . that would be a remarkable new capability,\" Afeyan said. \"We didn't have any way of doing it. We didn't have any proof it could be done. But we set out on a voyage.\"That voyage led them to use the genetic sequence of the coronavirus \u2014 provided by China \u2014 to program a code in messenger RNA to trigger an immune response. This week Moderna announced the vaccine showed a 94% efficacy in phase 3 trials and they applied to the FDA for emergency use authorization.\"We kind of kicked the project off in May, and to be in production in July is light speed,\u201d said Mark Caswell, head of engineering and facilities at Lonza's site in Portsmouth. \u201cProbably, I would argue nobody's ever done it that fast.\"Another Lonza facility in Switzerland is expecting to begin production soon. Caswell says it was helpful for his team in Portsmouth to be so close to the Moderna people in Cambridge. Even in a pandemic, that face-to-face interaction with Moderna's people helped speed things up.Before the vaccine gets to the public, though, there could be other delays.\"There's always a bottleneck,\" said Gary Pisano of Harvard Business School. Pisano\u2019s an expert in supply chains, who's previously done consulting work for Moderna and other companies founded by Flagship Pioneering. \"Your supply chain is only as good as the weakest link. So if you, say, get to the end of the supply chain and you say, 'wait a minute, we don't have enough people to administer the vaccine.' Well, then that's it. That's the capacity. I don't care how much manufacturing capacity you have around the world, you're only going to be able to give that amount.\"\"I'm sure there are hundreds of bottlenecks, and there have been that for all the whole way,\" Afeyan agreed. \u201cI think that what it takes to develop and then eventually distribute a vaccine at this scale is without any remote precedent \u2014 which can either concern us or it could make us humble to the fact that so many things are having to go right for us to make progress, that we just have to keep working at it.\" One thing that could make distribution of the Moderna vaccine easier is that it won't require the same kind of ultra-cold storage as the Pfizer version.Another Harvard Business School professor, Willy Shih, said it's all the hype that has him worried. Shih said people are getting their expectations up that this vaccine will be a silver bullet. \"It's a tour de force in terms of the scientific development,\" Shih said. \"But we're developing an expectation in the American public that once I get vaccinated, everything is going to be fine, I can go back to bars, I can go back to indoor restaurants for dinner and stuff like that.\"And he pointed out, there's still a lot more research to be done. The initial studies, for example, have focused exclusively on adults. Afeyan said Moderna expects to begin trials in teenagers this month, and will test the vaccine in children sometime in 2021. \"We're not going to be out of this for many, many quarters to come to get to such a high level of vaccine adoption that we can consider this disease, kind of, defeated,\" he said.These days, Afeyan said, the news is full of experts warning people not to let their guard down, and raising questions about the long-term effectiveness of a vaccine.Once Moderna's done its job, and a safe and effective vaccine is widely available, Afeyan said the challenge is going to be making sure people feel comfortable taking it. \"I think people have too low expectations. They have been completely paralyzed and confused about whether technology and a vaccine can help them.\" ",

      "body": "After a single-day count of over 400 new COVID-19 cases in Boston -- the highest since June's infection peak -- Mayor Marty Walsh is bracing for the possiblity that infection rates will continue to climb in the wake of this Thanksgiving weekend.Many residents, Walsh says, traveled or left their homes to visit with relatives despite public health advisaries urging them to stay home. That could mean a wave of new infections in coming days, Walsh said. \"We're going to be monitoring the data closely as it comes in to make sure we don't see large spikes,\" Walsh said. \"In the meantime, we have to continue to do everything we can to stop spreading the virus.\"Walsh urged, as he has done at every press availability in recent weeks, for all residents to get tested for COVID-19 if they have attended gatherings beyond their household and to make testing a part of their regular routines. Despite the cautionary tone, Walsh said there is also cause for cautious optimism: City-wide COVID-19 infection rates have seen a small but steady decline over the past two or three weeks -- and infection rates have remained stable, or declined slightly, in neighborhoods hit hardest by coronavirus. Walsh said the city's hospitals and health care infrustructure remain well within capacity to treat patients at current infection rates.  And the mayor voiced optimism about the possiblity of re-opening Boston schools for in-person learning, after the BPS re-opening plan was halted indefinitely due to rising COVID-19 cases.\"I'm not anticipating our schools reopening fully before Christmas, but I'm expecting we'll have some clarification as to what the reopening plan will be after Christmas,\" Walsh said. When you're dealing with a district like Boston you're dealing with one hundred twenty-plus schools, you're dealing with different grade configurations, different transportation challenges ....so certainly schools department is working hard to figure out what are some of the safety requirements we can put in place to make sure we can reopen schools safely.  Noting a planned protest by parents demanding BPS schools reopen, planned to take place on City Hall Plaza Wednesday, Walsh expressed sympathy, along with some tough love.  \"I support you,\" Walsh said. \"But right now, today, we are not prepared for that. Not when you have four hundred cases today.\"Walsh noted another piece of good news: Boston has received AAA credit ratings from top rating agencies for the eighth year in a row, despite the devestating economic impact the pandemic has had on the city's economy.\"That's an outstanding achievement,\" Walsh said, adding that the rating \"means we will be able to invest more of our resources in affordable housing, in climate resilience, in new schools and libraries, in green spaces and bike lanes.\" ",

      "body": "L\u2019Merchie Frazier says she was not surprised to see her event drowned out by a busy news cycle this fall.During the week of October 12, the U.S. was experiencing dramatic increases in coronavirus cases, Amy Coney Barrett went before the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss her Supreme COurt nomination, President Trump and Joe Biden held dueling nationally televised town halls and hundreds marched again in Boston and elsewhere asserting that Black Lives Matter. So Frazier says she was not surprised that few locally seemed to notice the marker installed that week on Boston\u2019s Long Wharf. The glass and metal structure was placed near the water\u2019s edge in recognition of the millions of enslaved Africans who died or survived the tortuous transatlantic journey to the Americas known as the Middle Passage between 1619 and 1865. The \u201cPort Marker\u201d was the culmination of a five-year dream for Frazier, the Director of Education for the Museum of African American History, one of the sponsors of the installation along with National Parks of Boston, Middle Passage Ceremonies and Port Markers Project, Boston Art Commission, and former State Representative and historian Byron Rushing. Last month, as the wind lashed mercilessly across the harbor, Frazier stood next to the marker to explain its significance. While many might have stood at that same spot overlooking iron grey waters and imagined a Pilgrim ship dropping anchor Frazier said she looked out and saw Black bodies -- \u201cThose lost at sea and those survivors that were able to get to the shores here who helped to found America.\u201d Marker FIVE.jpgThe marker bears the names and brief biographies of notable 18th century Africans in America including poet Phyllis Wheatley and sailor Crispus Attucks, believed to be the first person to die in the Revolutionary War. Also written on the monument is a history of Boston\u2019s role in the business of enslavement. The purpose is \u201cfor people who pass by this marker to get the truth that Massachusetts was the first colony to legally adopt slavery,\u201d said Frazier.Frazier said that history is critical because many in New England think of only the South when imagining enslaved men and women. Many have no idea of the enormous role Massachusetts played in this brutal enterprise. The same can be said of neighboring Rhode Island, said senator Harold Metts, who spearheaded a successful ballot initiative in the Nov.3 election to have the word \u201cplantation\u201d removed from the official name, \"The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\"Metts said, \u201cIt\u2019s really a sign of the times. When you think of the Confederate flag and the statues to Confederate generals and the Civil War where we had more people killed on both sides than any other war, and how America deals with the issues of race that we've never really healed from.\"Marker RI.jpegRhode Island voters approved the initiative after a summer of nationwide protests and calls for racial justice following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Black Lives Matter demonstrations were accompanied by demands for the removal of statues and monuments connected to racism and slavery. Kevin Peterson \u2014 a minister who runs the New Democracy Coalition in Boston \u2014 has led a half-decade long effort to change the name of Faneuil Hall, named for a Boston slave merchant. He sees the Rhode Island victory as instructive in reaching his goal closer to home.\u201cWe are in concert with activists in Rhode Island who sought to strip the name Plantation from its state seal\u2026\u2026We believe that Boston can do the same in terms of the change in the name of Faneuil Hall,\u201d said Peterson.Marker Faneuil Hall.jpg\u201cPeter Faneuil was \u2026 a person who traffics in selling human bodies, Africans. His name sits atop a public building in the city of Boston,\" Peterson said. \"It is a monument in our city which reflects white supremacy, which is odious to people who love democracy.\u201dPeterson believes the momentum is on his side, pointing also to Mississippi, where voters in November removed the confederate symbol from the state\u2019s flag.But in Boston, while Mayor Marty Walsh has declared racism a public health crisis, he has shown no inclination to change the name of Faneuil Hall. Mayoral candidates, Councilors Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell, have not been clear on the issue. In a statement to GBH, Campbell said she supported having a public conversation, but that \u201cremoving names and statues won\u2019t stop racism in the City of Boston or eradicate racial inequities.\u201dFrazier of the Museum of African American History agrees. \u201cThe hall has its place in history,\u201d she said, pointing out that the very idea for the Port Marker in Boston began with the commemoration of the International Day of Slavery on Aug. 23 , 2015 at Faneuil Hall. \u201cPeter Faneuil was an enslaver,\" Frazier said.  \"However, I think these discussions have different remedies as we remove these, what's going to mark the history of what happened?\u201dHistory is complex said Frazier. She would rather see a marker in front of Faneuil Hall to explain the namesake\u2019s connection to slavery rather than removing the name itself. But looking toward the harbor\u2014 where thousands of Africans were unloaded from ships like cargo \u2014 she conceded there will always be disagreements over how to mark history even among those who are in agreement on the need to demonstrate Black Lives matter, then and now. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly named the New Democracy Coalition.",

      "body": "Advocates for increased oversight of Massachusetts police welcomed passage of compromise legislation Tuesday that would empower a majority-civilian review board that would have the power to remove officers from service if they were found guilty of wrongdoing or abusing their authority.\"Many tens of thousands of people marched in Massachusetts in so many demonstrations, as they did around the country, asking them to address these issues and this does address not all, but at least some, of those issues,\" activist Lew Finfer said of the 129-page bill passed by the House and Senate.\"Don't think that this comes from the benevolence of government,\" community organizer and writer Jamarhl Crawford told GBH News.Crawford, a member of Mayor Marty Walsh's Boston police reform task force, continued: \"This came from decades of push from the grassroots and community folks, myself among them, who have pushed and prodded these people and informed these people on these issues for decades.\"The final bill, the result of months of secret negotiations between House and Senate leaders, was approved by both branches of the Legislature Tuesday night by closer margins than Beacon Hill usually sees.The 92-to-67 vote is one of the narrowest margins for a major bill in Speaker Robert DeLeo's 11 years at the helm of the House, failing to secure the two-thirds majority needed to override Gov. Charlie Baker's amendments.Conservatives like Brewster Rep. Tim Whelan voted 'no' because progressives added bans on facial recognition technology and some police procedures not directly connected to police oversight.\"That was introduced by the special interests who took control, took control of a very good thing that we did and that we had going on. It became a wish list to the detriment of our process,\" Whelan said on the House floor.Police unions had fought to lobby negotiators to step back on provisions that would ban the use of certain types force by police and curtail protections officers have from civil lawsuits. In a letter to members, leaders of the Massachusetts Coalition of Police described the Legislature's work, which began in July, as a \"grossly unfair and opaque\" process that \"played out in secret.\"The letter criticized the keystone of the new reform effort, a nine-member oversight panel that would be empowered to investigate complaints of wrongdoing by police and to decertify an officer, effectively ending their policing career.\"The final compromise legislation is a final attack on police officers by lawmakers on Beacon Hill,\" they wrote and urged Gov. Charlie Baker to reject the legislation.\"We are concerned with the limited visible process, the unknown and extensive costs of this legislation, the minimal representation on the boards and commissions from the professions they oversee, and the lack of study of the consequences for public safety \u2014 both intended and unintended,\" the State Police Association wrote in a press statement.The Boston Police Patrolmen's Association did not respond to GBH News' requests for comment.The bill is now on Baker's desk, giving him 10 days to review it before signing it, vetoing it, or offering changes.Baker approves of much of the bill, but could side with the House GOP and police unions that want to remove limits on police legal protections and bans on some police tactics.Baker said Tuesday that his office has yet to finish its review of the legislation. \"I'm glad that the legislature moved forward on this. I'm glad this is something that was part of what they consider to be important to get done before the end of the session. But I can't speak to the specifics of this until we have a chance to review it,\" Baker said.Police reform activists were generally pleased with the final outcome.\"It's really a huge step, an historic step, towards justice in the Commonwealth,\" ACLU Massachusetts president Carol Rose said Tuesday on GBH News's Boston Public Radio. \"This really reflects a lot of compromise, including some compromises from civil rights groups, but I think it's really a step forward,\" Rose said.Crawford, on the other hand, was skeptical that the new law would have the impact supporters are looking for.\"There's no indication that decertification is going to improve police performance or community relations,\" he said. \"It just creates a mechanism by which these people can be held accountable.\"",

      "body": "In a republic based on the consent of the governed, there is a strong public interest in having an educated citizenry. Yet here in Massachusetts, the cradle of public schooling in America where the state constitution directs us to \u201ccherish\u201d education, we seem to dole out incentives for just about everything except education.Consider the Race Horse Development Fund. Since 2014 the Commonwealth has spent nearly $80 million to subsidize a horse racing industry that\u2019s dying from the increasing availability of other forms of gambling. Since most of the fund\u2019s money comes from a tax on Plainridge Park Casino revenue, it amounts to a transfer from gamblers who tend to be low income to wealthy race horse owners.State taxpayers paid at least $80 million in fiscal 2019 for a film tax credit designed to encourage producers to make movies here. But a 2014 Massachusetts Department of Revenue report cast doubt on the profitability of these credits. It found that only about a third of the spending generated and jobs created by the credits occurred in Massachusetts, and most of those jobs lasted less than three months \u2013 some for just a weekend. When you add it all up, the Commonwealth paid well north of $100,000 for each job created.All told, a state commission found that these so-called tax expenditures \u2013 exemptions, deductions, credits and deferrals designed to encourage certain activities or limit the burden on certain types of individuals or endeavors \u2013 accounted for about $26 billion in foregone revenue in 2013, or nearly two thirds of the entire state budget at the time. Many tax expenditures are well founded, but it makes you wonder exactly what the Commonwealth encourages and discourages, and how much it costs.The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue may make it possible for Massachusetts to encourage education tax credits \u2013 and it wouldn\u2019t cost taxpayers a penny.Our nation\u2019s founders clearly envisioned public support for a range of both religious and non-sectarian school options. That educationally pluralistic vison was widely accepted until the mid-19th century, when the Irish Potato Famine triggered a flood of Catholic immigrants to the United States. In a response based on nativism and anti-Catholic bigotry, during the mid-to-late 1800s many states adopted so-called Anti-Aid Amendments to their constitutions that barred public support of the Catholic schools to which many Irish immigrants sent their children. Sadly, in 1855 the Know-Nothing Party made Massachusetts among the first states to adopt such an amendmentMontana was another of the nearly 40 states that adopted an Anti-Aid Amendment. There, Kendra Espinoza, a suddenly single mom, sought a better education for her two daughters. In public schools, one daughter was bullied and the other struggled academically. Both would later thrive using Montana\u2019s education tax credit program to attend a religious school.The Montana Supreme Court cited the state\u2019s Anti-Aid amendment when it invalidated the tax credit program, denying Espinoza access to funding her children needed. But this June the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the amendment as an example of unconstitutional discrimination against religious school parents who were benefiting from the credit.Nearly 300,000 largely poor and minority students in 18 states including New Hampshire and Rhode Island benefit from education tax credits. Under these programs, most of which are need-based, individuals and businesses receive tax credits for contributions to scholarship-granting organizations, which then provide scholarships that students use to attend the public, private or religious schools of their choice. More than 90 percent of parents with students in choice programs say they are satisfied with them.It\u2019s hardly a radical approach. While the programs grant tax credits for private donations, state and federal governments provide direct grants and loans to students who choose to go to Notre Dame, Yeshiva, or a public university. America\u2019s choice-driven higher education system is the envy of the world.An education tax credit program would, for example, allow more students to attend the Commonwealth\u2019s excellent Catholic schools, which have similar demographics but consistently outperform public schools, despite spending far less. Amid the pandemic, 4,000 more students are attending Archdiocese of Boston schools.Espinoza makes education tax credit programs possible for many more students. If one is enacted in Massachusetts, it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that it\u2019ll deliver more bang for the buck than the Race Horse Development Fund or state taxpayers subsidizing Hollywood.Charles Chieppo is a senior fellow and Jamie Gass is director of education research and policy at Pioneer Institute, a Boston-based think tank.",

He told Boston Public Radio on Wednesday this next chapter in his career will allow him to continue his work on social justice issues and civic service, as Boston's inequities have been placed in stark relief by the pandemic and the national racial reckoning following the police killing of George Floyd earlier this year.\"We're still living in the shadow of a triple pandemic: COVID-19, economic devastation and also this exposure of systemic and structural inequities here and elsewhere,\" he said. \"However, it is my belief that our principal focus right now should be seeing through the lens of racial equity, or inequity. That's where we need to focus our attention.\"Pelton cited figures from 2015 that show a staggering wealth gap in Boston between white families \u2014 who had a median wealth of around $225,000 \u2014 and Black families, who had a median wealth of $8.\"We are a city that's divided by resources and wealth, and so that's where we need to begin our work,\" said Pelton. \"The fact that there's such an enormous gap between net worth for white families and Black families, that is not a single event. ... What that suggests is there's something in our culture, our environment, our laws, our policies, that contribute to making that gap without making progress.\"In a letter to the Emerson community, Pelton wrote that this moment provides an opportunity to enact big change.\"We must not let this moment pass without also working to strengthen cradle-to-college education, improve access to health care, close income gaps, create access to quality jobs, combat ableism, protect the rights of immigrants, and so much more,\" he wrote.Pelton served as Emerson College's first Black president and will be The Boston Foundation's second Black president.",

Instead, she logs onto her classes from home. Learning from afar may be the safest option during a pandemic, but high school seniors across the state who are chronicling their experiences for GBH News\u2019 COVID and the Classroom series echo Knox\u2019 assessment: When school happens via a screen it\u2019s easy to feel disconnected. ModuleMany of the seniors participating in GBH News\u2019 COVID and the Classroom series describe the year as a lonely one. Thomas White, the captain of the cross country team at Boston Latin School, considers himself lucky - sort of. His team was able to practice and even compete this fall with restrictions, including masks and a much smaller than usual field of competition. But when Boston\u2019s COVID numbers climbed in late October, the city shut down all public school sports.\u201cWe\u2019re really grateful to have what we had,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s just upsetting to lose out on something that, just in short term, I\u2019ve been working for last six or seven months.\u201dOf course, not all schools are fully remote. But even students who spend part of their time inside a school building have limited contact with their classmates.\u201cOne of the hardest parts about this year is not being able to see all my friends in school,\u201d said Hannah Charron, a senior at Apponequet Regional High School in Lakeville, which is using a hybrid system of remote and in-person classes. \u201cWe were broken up into two cohorts alphabetically, so half our senior class isn\u2019t even there while I\u2019m there.\u201d During a fall when many seniors have missed out on everything from college admissions tests to the annual pep rally, few are counting on experiencing other rituals that commonly mark the last year of high school - including prom or a traditional graduation. \u201cInstead,\u201d said Charron, \u201cwe\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens.\u201dHear more from the high school seniors GBH News is following this year for our COVID and the Classroom series in the video above produced and edited by Greg Shea.

      "body": "Thirteen Massachusetts communities, including Boston, Worcester and Lawrence, have had COVID-19 clusters in schools and received state testing services, officials said.The state Executive Office of Education told GBH News that as of Dec. 1 the state has deployed its rapid mobile testing unit to those schools and ones in Braintree, Acton/Boxborough, Milton, Malden, Rockland, Southwick, Haverhill, Winchester, Billerica and Marshfield. The service has been available to schools since late August.Harvard epidemiologist William Hanage said the number of clusters should not spark alarm among parents. The small numbers are what he would expect, he said, because research shows lower infection rates among children ages 10 and under.\"A lot of people kind of will say O.M.G. there's a virus among us,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it's important to remember that finding the cases is much more important than not finding them.\"Gov. Charlie Baker and administration officials have frequently urged a return to in-person learning, despite COVID-19 rates that are climbing. State education officials have said there are \u201cvery limited instances of in-school transmission\u201d and when they do occur, they are \u201csmall and limited in nature.\u201dThe rapid response unit will go to districts where there is suspicion that the virus has spread in a school and there are two or more cases in a span of 14 days. If a state epidemiologist agrees, the unit is deployed by the state\u2019s COVID-19 Command Response Center to offer free testing to asymptomatic students, teachers and staff.Schools may request the unit pending approval from the state. State officials did not name the affected schools, which could be regular public, charter, private or parochial. The state said its testing unit has been deployed in Brighton but a spokesman for the Boston Public Schools said he was not aware of any of the district's schools in that neighborhood using the mobile unit. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said earlier this week that he hopes the Boston Public Schools can reopen after the holidays. It has postponed its start several times due to the pandemic. Walsh said that he is also anxious about an increase in cases following the Thanksgiving holiday and is taking a wait-and-see approach. Most students in the city are learning remotely with the exception of a small number of special needs students.Two Boston parent activist groups \u2014 Voices for BPS Families and Massachusetts Parents United \u2014 held a rally outside Boston City Hall Wednesday and started a petition to \u201cget our kids back in school ASAP.\u201d\u201cYou cannot continue to jerk families around this way,\u201d Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said in an interview with GBH News. \u201cWho can run their house on a week-to-week basis not knowing if their kid\u2019s going to be in school or not?\u201dIn Worcester, the mobile testing unit responded to a cluster that occurred at the Abby Kelly Foster Charter School, a school that says its mission is to assist parents as their child\u2019s primary educator.State officials said the mobile testing unit has been dispatched to Braintree and Lawrence twice. Local officials in both municipalities did not respond to requests for comment.Braintree, 30 miles south of Boston, has had persistent problems controlling the virus. Last spring, outbreaks in nursing homes caused infections to spike. In June, Mayor Charles C. Kokoros was diagnosed with COVID. And in August, Archbishop Williams High School canceled its in-person graduation after a student and parent tested positive.The parent had attended a religious service at the Catholic school and later tested positive. In the meantime, their child attended a senior breakfast at the Granite Links Golf Club and tested positive the next day. That forced about a half dozen employees of the golf club into quarantine for 14 days, according to The Patriot Ledger.About a month later, Braintree High School also had two confirmed student cases.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the Worcester school where the state deployed its mobile testing unit. It was the Abby Kelley Foster Charter School, which abuts the Central Massachusetts Collaborative on New Bond Street.  ",

Visits are still allowed for other adult patients, MGH says, but the hospital is urging visitors to stay no longer than two hours. Lawrence General Hospital announced similar restrictions weeks ago, in early November.  And Tufts Medical Center and Tufts Children\u2019s Hospital, announced new visitation restrictions Tuesday that prohibit almost all visits to adult patients. In a statement issued Wednesday, Tufts Medical said visitation will still be allowed for some pediatric patients, as well as to the hospital\u2019s neonatal intensive care unit. Speaking with GBH News Wednesday, Tufts Chief Nursing Officer Terry Hudson-Jinks said the decision to restrict visitation was not an easy one.\u201cThe primary goal is safety for everyone. So as COVID-19 rates have increased in the community, the focus for us is to make sure we have a safe environment for our patients and our staff,\u201d Hudson-Jinks said. \u201cBy restricting visitation we are limiting the number of people that are entering our facility greatly, and in our eyes that reduces the risk,\u201d Hudson-Jinks says medical staff are doing their best to help patients connect with family members via electronic devices.  \"We\u2019ve been able to almost recreate the atmosphere \u2013 almost \u2013 of family being in the room,\u201d she said. While medical providers and state health officials are in close communication, Hudson-Jinks said, right now decisions around specific visitation policies are up to individual providers. ",

      "body": "GBH News has learned that Boston attorney Rosemary Scapicchio is filing for a new trial for Sean Ellis to clear her client of a gun conviction that remains even after his conviction in the 1993 murder of Boston Police detective was overturned after he spent more than 22 years in jail.Detective John Mulligan was murdered during the early morning hours Sept. 26, 1993 while sitting in his car outside a Walgreens store in Roslindale, off American Legion Highway. Ellis and a co-defendant, Terry Patterson, who was tried separately, were tied to the murder based on evidence produced by detectives who themselves were under investigation at the time for corruption. That information was never relayed to the defense and Ellis was ordered released from prison in 2015 by a Suffolk County judge who concluded that Ellis had not received a fair trial. But the conviction on illegal possession of the murder weapon was left in place.Three years later, former Suffolk County DA John Pappas declined to retry the murder case fearing that the prosecution could not win a conviction. But Pappas and Boston Police Commissioner William Gross continue to insist on Ellis\u2019s guilt. Mulligan was shot five times in the face with a .25-caliber pistol. Scapicchio says her client had nothing to do with the murder or the gun and will be going to court in the coming days to prove it. For 22 years and 7 months that he was behind bars Ellis maintained his innocence and says that a jury trial may be the only way to demonstrate that conclusively. The Sean Ellis case is the subject of a new Netflix docuseries called Trial 4. ",

This once-in-a-generation exhibition allows audiences to not only take a chronological look at the artist\u2019s career, but also discover how Boston collectors made their way into Monet\u2019s circle and championed his work back home.\u201cThere's something that can be so transportive about Monet's beautiful vision of nature, and about Monet's willingness to see variety and splendor in the mundane,\u201d says curator Katie Hanson. \u201cMonet didn't place a limit on his own creativity. He continued to be curious. He continued to look at the world around him in new and invigorating ways.\u201dWatch: Jared Bowen joins Morning Edition with Joe Mathieu to discuss the exhibit, featuring artwork on displayJared Bowen Discusses \"Monet and Boston: Lasting Impression\" Exhibit At Boston's Museum Of Fine Arts\u201cShowstopper Virtual Play Series,\u201d presented virtually by New Repertory Theatre through December 13Herrera Photo SS.pngNew Repertory Theatre presents two premieres.

The first play performed is \u201cA Very Herrera Holiday\u201d by Alexis Scheer and directed by Sarah Shin, featuring actor Amanda Figueroa as a domestic diva with the perfect coquito recipe and ever-endearing craft projects. But spend a little time with her and you realize she\u2019s criminally talented. The second play, \u201c[keyp-ing],\u201d is written by Miranda ADEkoje, directed by Dawn M.

      "body": "After losing their home in Wilmington to foreclosure in 2012, the DuMoulin Scalona family \u2014 Bill, Cherie and their seven children \u2014 crammed into one-bedroom motel rooms before beginning an odyssey through the state's emergency housing system, which provides temporary apartments to low-income families in need. The available housing was in Holyoke, more than 100 miles away from their community of friends and family and the children\u2019s schools. \u201cJust uprooted, uprooted,\u201d said Cherie, describing how officials moved the family. \u201cAnd here, \u2018we're taking you from this side of the state and we're plopping you on the other side of the state and you figure it out.'\"The family is now facing eviction again. Bill's job, he said, was never enough to keep up with bills and the rent.\"I've been trying to work as much as I can, but when you're so far behind and being put out over two hours away from your home origin, it just really set this family back,\u201d he said. Their experience is already not unique and, as the pandemic drags on, will become even more common. As COVID-19 drives up the need for emergency housing, advocates fear many more families will have to be placed farther away from the lifelines of their home communities. The state has to piece together priority placements and available housing, so it\u2019s a bit like a \u201cjigsaw puzzle,\u201d said Andrea Park, attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. \u201cPeople often end up waiting a very, very long time because of the mismatch between the shelter placements and the geography,\" she said. \"And so that is why families very regularly get sent off into different places in the state.\u201d Since the Massachusetts eviction moratorium was lifted in October, eviction filings have risen back to pre-pandemic levels, with thousands more expected when federal protections end in less than a month. The state is beefing up a number of existing relief programs to try to keep people in their homes, but experts say those resources fall well short of what\u2019s needed, and once a family is pushed out of their home, the cycle of instability can go on for years. Just over a year and a half ago, Bill got a new job as an assistant manager at a gas station. Before he got his first paycheck, he said, the family was moved from their shelter apartment into a market rate apartment in Holyoke through the state\u2019s HomeBASE program. It's meant to jumpstart people into self-sufficiency and provided the family a year of rental assistance. But soon after their year of state aid ended, the family fell behind.\u201cYou just want to be able to have food on the table, clothes for the children,\u201d Dumoulin said. \u201cIf they need $10 for an assignment book that you don't have to say, \u2018Oh my God, where's that coming from?\u2019\u201dThat anxiety, said Park, is becoming increasingly familiar. \u201cThere's been so many layoffs in the hotel and restaurant industries and people get these notices. They feel hopeless. People returning to abusive situations because they are desperate, doubling up and there's a psychological breaking point, I think, for everybody who knows that there's money owed and they might not be able to do anything about it.\u201d \u201cHomelessness and eviction can spiral a family in a way that has really long-lasting repercussions on the children, [and] the family itself. It's a really destabilizing force,\u201d said Stephanie Herron Rice, a housing benefits attorney with the Justice Center of Southeast Massachusetts. \u201cOnce a family has been destabilized in that way, it's very hard to get them rehoused in a stable way in a state like ours with such high rent and such little affordable housing.\u201dOfficials with the Department of Housing and Community Development didn\u2019t respond to repeated requests for interviews but pointed to ongoing expansion of eviction prevention and \u201crapid rehousing\u201d programs. \u201cThe eviction crisis did not start in the state with COVID. The affordable housing crisis did not start in the state with COVID,\u201d Herron Rice said. \u201c[The state is] trying to help people in this. And they have a lot of programs to avoid eviction. But it's not enough.\u201dThe DuMoulin Scalona family has applied for Residential Assistance for Families in Transition (RAFT) \u2014 the state\u2019s rental assistance program \u2014 which was recently expanded. But more than a month later, they\u2019ve still not heard back. And the family\u2019s anxiety is rising: Cherie said more recently the family got a visit from a constable bringing more paperwork related to their eviction. Fifteen-year-old Ally DuMoulin has spent more than half her life moving homes and schools and said it's hard to stay focused.\u201cIt's not healthy for your head, you\u2019re in so many different places. You don't know where you're going next. You don't know what your next move is or what your next meal is,\u201d Ally DuMoulin said. \u201d You don't know any of these things until the last moment. And nobody understands that.\u201d ",

      "body": "Mayor Marty Walsh warned Boston residents Thursday the city is at a critical point that could determine how the year-end holidays proceed \u2014 with strict lockdown measures in place or looking towards reopening. The update came a day after Massachusetts confirmed a record one-day increase of 4,613 COVID-19 cases. The city confirmed 542 new cases, a third consecutive day of increases, according to the Boston Health Commission.Responding to a question about potential additional COVID precautions, Walsh said the city is at a tipping point. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon all of us. The next step is shutting everything down,\u201d Walsh said during press conference. \u201cWe\u2019re three weeks away from Christmas, our retailers need people to go in and shop, our restaurants need people to eat in, people working, they need to make money \u2014 that\u2019s the last resort is wanting to shut things down. Earlier in the week, the mayor explained the city was bracing for a spike in cases driven by the multitudes who traveled and spent Thanksgiving with extended family despite repeated warnings from government and health officials. On Thursday, Walsh said the city is starting to see the result of that disregard and implored residents again to take the necessary steps to stop spread of the virus \u2014 wearing face coverings, washing hands frequently and using hand sanitizer, cleaning and disinfecting surrounding areas and avoiding large gatherings. \u201cIf you\u2019re at work and you get the virus \u2026 I can understand that,\u201d Walsh explained. \u201cBut if you have a house party with 20 people in it, and you pass the virus around, I don\u2019t understand that.\u201d The mayor also noted that the state is preparing to receive and distribute vaccines through the Department of Public Health and then through municipal health departments. Marty Martinez, Health and Human Services chief, said the details are being worked out, but identified public confidence in the vaccines\u2019 safety and effectiveness as the main barrier to distribution. Walsh also pointed to the upcoming Christmas holiday and asked the public to support the U.S. Marine Corps\u2019 Marine Toys for Tots toy drive. \u201cUsually, I\u2019d be joining them at a warehouse in South Boston for a big kickoff. This year, there are challenges,\u201d Walsh said, noting that many offices and toy collection sites are closed or sparsely populated. ",

      "body": "On Thursday's Boston Public Radio, former Mass. Education Secretary Paul Reville weighed in on the debate about student debt forgiveness, responding to a recent Boston Globe opinion piece by Jeff Jacoby arguing that a student loan bailout from the incoming Biden administration would be \u201cunjust\u201d to the millions of Americans not in debt. While Reville conceded that he\u2019d need to see a concrete proposal before making a fair assessment, he also said that the idea of abandoning any form of bailout \u201cdoes not make sense to me.\u201d\u201cThis is a huge burden,\u201d he said of the current glut of U.S. student loans, which total about $1.7 trillion. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming a great many students from low-income to middle-income around the United States, and having an effect on what they can do to set up their lives.\u201dOne of Jacoby\u2019s arguments, echoed by other opponents of student loan forgiveness, is that such a policy would effectively punish Americans who've already worked to pay off their loans. \"Some of the arguments brought forward, that we shouldn\u2019t do any of this because people have already been through the system, is absurd,\u201d Reville said. \"We\u2019ve gotta be improving the system, and we\u2019ve laid this unsupportable amount of debt on hundreds of thousands of people across the country.\"Reville lamented, though, that any substantive plan from the incoming Biden adminsitration regarding student debt relief is going to be difficult to execute.  \"The challenge of this administration is it\u2019s got a lot of big ideas that are gonna cost a lot of money,\" he said. \"And the politics are not necessarily there to deliver the amount of money that they\u2019re going to need to execute the ideas.\u201dPaul Reville is a former Mass. Secretary of Education and a professor at Harvard University\u2019s Graduate School of Education, where he also runs the Education Redesign Lab.

He says the company anticipated higher demand for their freezers earlier this year when vaccines like the one being developed by Pfizer started showing promise.\u201cThe fact is, we\u2019ve been looking at this for months. As soon as we knew mRNA vaccines were going to be in play, we started projecting and planning from a supply chain perspective,\u201d Esmon said.Esmon said the company's freezers can store the Pfizer vaccine at its required temperature: -94 degrees Fahrenheit.\u201cWe call these fit for purpose units,\" he said. \"They are built with scientific research, medical research in mind. We've been building these since the 1950s.\u201dThe company prepared its manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina to meet the new demand, Esmon said, which is now two to three times greater than usual.Meanwhile, Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) is making plans to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine to more than 140,000 patients in Cambridge, Somerville and Boston\u2019s metro-north region once a vaccine arrives. Christian Lanphere, emergency management director for CHA, said its two acute care hospitals are coordinating with the Massachusetts Hospital Association and the state Department of Public Health on how to disseminate the vaccine to patients.\u201cWe're going to centralize the vaccine at one campus, regardless if its Pfizer or Moderna,\" he said.Lanphere said a coordinated effort to vaccinate CHA's health care workers is underway.\u201cWe are now trying to focus our efforts on who within our system will become the first group to be offered the vaccine, but this will not be mandatory for our staff.\u201dLanphere says the vaccine will not only go to nurses and doctors who deal directly with COVID-19 patients, but he says CHA will ensure that housekeeping staff, respiratory therapists, dieticians, and others are also in the first group.",

But researchers say colleges in Massachusetts and the rest of New England so far have been national models in testing frequently and containing the virus. \u201cNew England is crushing it,\u201d says Chris Marsicano, who directs the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, which has been tracking colleges\u2019 COVID plans. Marsicano\u2019s research team finds just eight percent of colleges nationwide required testing as students left for Thanksgiving. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly concerning,\u201d Marsicano said. \u201cWhenever students move from one point to another, they spread the disease with them.\u201dIn New England, though, 90 percent of colleges offering some in-person classes did frequent testing before the break. \u201cThere's no region that has a greater proportion of its institutions testing weekly or bi-weekly than New England,\u201d Marsicano said.The pandemic has created a logistical nightmare for colleges. After the Thanksgiving break, many colleges, including Emerson, MIT and Brandeis, cut short the in-person semester. But others, like Boston University and Northeastern, are staying the course with some in-person classes, even as the state\u2019s infection rate surges.That situation raises the risk that those local colleges could become what one medical historian calls \u201cthe Wuhans of the fall surge.\u201dThe Broad Institute, which has conducted much of the testing in New England, says about one to two in a thousand on-campus tests came back positive this semester. \u201cHere in Massachusetts, I think we\u2019re actually lighting the way to how to live and learn in the age of COVID,\u201d said Laurie Leshin, president of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, which partnered with the Broad Institute to test its students, faculty and staff weekly. WPI administrators asked those students who went home for Thanksgiving to stay there. Still, Leshin acknowledges there\u2019s no way to guarantee students complied.\u201cThat\u2019s one really important reason we\u2019re continuing to test everybody,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did over a thousand tests yesterday.\u201d Leshin, who led a group of college presidents that rolled out guidelines for re-opening campuses in Massachusetts this fall, says WPI has managed to stay open with 80 positive cases reported since August.\u201cI really sincerely hope that other parts of the country look to our successful model and set up a way that they can do the same because we\u2019ve shown that it\u2019s possible to stay open and keep operating with relatively low case numbers,\u201d she said.Without naming names, the nation's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci told GBH News some colleges are doing a good job, while others are not. What grade would Fauci give colleges so far?\u201cMixed,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to grade the college enterprise as a whole because I\u2019d be insulting those that are doing it so well, but those who are not should seriously look at some of the colleges that are doing it well.\u201dFauci says COVID testing on campus serves as a model for the rest of the country.\u201cThe colleges that are doing it right have a very low-level of outbreaks,\u201d he said.Before Thanksgiving, Boston University administrators strongly encouraged students who went home to stay there and said those who did return to campus should quarantine for two weeks unless they have three consecutive negative tests.Some faculty, though, are skeptical of this approach.\u201cBy the time you get cleared, there's only two weeks of class and I think one of them is a reading period, so it doesn't really make much sense,\u201d said Michael Siegel, who teaches epidemiology at BU\u2019s School of Public Health. Since September, Siegel and other professors have been critical of BU\u2019s decision to offer in-person classes, saying it proved that New England\u2019s largest private university is more concerned about its bottom line than public health.Three months and tens of thousands of tests later, BU is reporting more than 500 positive cases \u2013 but a minuscule 0.1% positivity rate. Still, Siegel thinks BU is being reckless and putting other residents of greater Boston at risk.\u201cI really can only think of one reason why they are holding the line right now, which is essentially hubris, stubbornness,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to admit failure.\u201dAnd Siegel says the low-level of outbreaks only proves administrators at BU and elsewhere got \u201clucky.\u201d\u201cThere was no guarantee that this would happen,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to say that this was a success because just last week there were 14 staff members that came down with COVID.\u201dLooking ahead, Siegel is worried about the remainder of the semester as infection rates on campus \u2013 and across the country \u2013 continue to climb.But BU spokeswoman Rachel Lapal Cavallario said the relatively low infection rate on campus is not just good fortune. \u201cGuided by public health and safety best practices, BU implemented frequent testing, contact tracing, and quarantine and isolation housing,\" Lapal said. \"This system along with the BU community\u2019s commitment to follow public health protocols, such as wearing a face covering, physical distancing, completing daily attestations, testing and cooperating with contact tracing has led to lower positivity rates this semester.\u201dDiane Adame contributed to this report.",

      "body": "There is no such thing as one bad apple. As science makes clear \u2014 a single rotting apple actually accelerates the rotting of the entire bunch. This fact might not matter if the decaying fruit hadn\u2019t come to symbolize the corrosion in our system of criminal justice. A system in which police accountability is more often the exception, not the rule. And the imagined single bad apple is part of a mythology used to excuse rampant brutality, unethical behavior, and even outright crimes by officers. You\u2019ve heard the comments: \u2018Most police officers are hard-working public servants; it\u2019s just a few bad apples that give the rest of them a bad name.\u2019 Heed the science, it just takes one to spread the rot.And the lived experiences of victims of police misconduct tell an ugly story. It\u2019s that reality that has long motivated protests against criminal justice abuses, calls for defunding the police and campaigns for legislative policy reform. Some veteran activists, especially, feel vindicated after last week when the Massachusetts House and Senate passed a police reform bill. Jamarhl Crawford, creator of the Blackstonian newspaper and a community organizer, told GBH News, \"This came from decades of push from the grassroots and community folks, myself among them, who have pushed and prodded these people and informed these people on these issues for decades.\"Most notably, the new bill would empower a civilian review board to remove officers found guilty of wrongdoing. And it would also require officers to be certified every three years, certification that can be denied for violations like excessive use of force. Predictably, the Massachusetts Coalition of Police, the state\u2019s largest police union, issued a statement criticizing the bill as \u201ca final attack on police officers by lawmakers on Beacon Hill.\u201d From the outset, police officers complained they were left out of the process and claimed the then proposed measures were unnecessarily restrictive and would hamstring the way officers worked. Many were convinced that the Massachusetts reform was driven by public reaction to abuses elsewhere, specifically the death of Minnesota\u2019s George Floyd, killed by police officer Derek Chauvin who kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. But police misconduct happens here, too. From the documented terrorizing encounters, to the racialized stop and frisks, and the SWAT teams carrying out violent door knocking raids, often at the wrong address. That, plus the internal corruption detailed in cases like those of Sean Ellis \u2014 who spent 22 years in prison based on tainted Boston police evidence. What\u2019s more, the city has paid out millions of dollars in settlements to victims because of police abuse. There\u2019s always been plenty of debate about the extent of police abuse and the culture in which it thrives. This bill reflects the tension of lawmakers\u2019 effort to support corrective measures preventing police abuse, as well as their reluctance to repudiate police. The strength of the bill is at risk, since lawmakers failed to get the two-thirds majority needed to override amendments from Gov. Charlie Baker. But, if this carefully crafted policy compromise is significantly watered down, then I fear it may be impossible to get rid of the stink of rotting apples.",

Baker's desk awaiting approval and amendment \u2014 would not fundamentally change how Boston Police operates, Mayor Marty Walsh said Friday.Walsh claimed that city has already enacted reforms the state has not yet finalized. He told Boston Public Radio on Friday the bill will improve public transparency around \"complaints against police officers,\" but said the bill at the State House includes reforms \"taken right out of Boston.\"\"We have practices for excessive use of force, we don't use chokeholds,\" he said. \"A lot of what's in the bill, even though it'll require Boston to follow state law, we do it already.\"The compromise police reform bill empowers a majority-civilian review board to remove officers from service if they're found guilty of wrongdoing and sets use of force guidelines. In November, Walsh drafted an ordinance for Boston to create its own independent police watchdog office, the first in a number of reforms laid out by the city's police reform task force. Walsh also said Friday the city is creating a public dashboard to track any complaints against police officers as part of the task force's recommendations.Some city councilors still say there are issues within the Boston Police Department around union contract negotiations. A number of councilors have proposed changes to the contracts, like holding more public contract negotiations and replacing confidential arbitration with a more transparent process.Walsh firmly rejected the idea of public contract negotiations.\"You can't negotiate a contract publicly like that, it's not going to work,\" he said. \"First of all, it's the law, and number two ... it's not the public versus the union, it's the entity, the employer, the city of Boston, in this particular case.\"He also defended arbitration, saying \"everyone's entitled to their day in court.\"Walsh, viewed as a pro-union mayor, takes a position at odds with previous police commissioners who have complained that aribtration has allowed corrupt cops to stay on the force.",

Today, 'Saving Bookstores.'When COVID-19 forced shutdowns in March, independent bookstores saw an immediate 8 percent overall drop in book sales from last year. But soon Americans returned to reading and buying books. However, some bookstores were forced to close before they could benefit from the uptick in sales. Others are still struggling to recover - scrambling to adapt so they can live to fight another day. Hundreds of independent bookstores have closed their doors for good - one a week according to a recent survey by the American Booksellers Association. But some local bookstores are making it work. We talk to three local independent bookstore owners, during Part One of the show.Guests:Christina Ciampa, owner of the All She Wrote Books in Somerville, Mass.Kate Layte, owner of Papercuts Bookshop in Boston, Mass.Matt Tannenbaum, owner of The Bookstore in Lenox, Mass.And featuring Leonard and Clarrissa Egerton, the husband and wife owners of Roxbury\u2019s Frugal Bookstore, the only Black-owned bookstore in Boston, Mass.

      "body": "It\u2019s been easy to miss, what with a surging pandemic and surreal presidential election, but next year\u2019s Boston mayoral race is already underway.Two city councilors, Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell, have been campaigning for weeks, making their respective cases and raising more than a quarter million dollars each since their September announcements. And now, multiple signs point to the incumbent Mayor Marty Walsh joining them in the near future. The race features a strange dynamic. The election could be historic, since Boston has never had a female mayor or a mayor of color. But with two candidates, not just one, capable of breaking those barriers, the chance to be a trailblazer isn\u2019t distinctive \u2014 at least, not yet.So recently, GBH News asked both Campbell and Wu: For voters who want an alternative to Marty Walsh, what sets you apart?\u201cMy work has always been grounded in \u2026 my personal story,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI got into politics and being a public servant after losing my twin brother Andre, who I talk about all the time, who is near and dear to me.\u201dAndre Campbell died at 29, while being held in pre-trial detention by the Massachusetts Department of Correction. For Campbell, his fate embodies a system that allows some Bostonians to thrive, while grinding others down. \u201cI\u2019m always focused on dismantling systems that perpetuate inequities, and using my story as an example \u2026 of a girl who grew up in the city of Boston, who was a [Boston Public Schools] kid, that understands these inequities not just from an academic perspective, but [has] lived them,\u201d Campbell said.Tying politics to biography could distinguish Campbell from Walsh, who has own very different set of Boston experiences \u2014 including growing up Irish Catholic and battling alcoholism \u2014 and also from Wu, who went to high school in Illinois, and moved to Massachusetts to attend Harvard College.When Wu was asked to contrast herself to Campbell, she had a very different response. \u201cWell, first, I would challenge the frame that there\u2019s a spot for the mayor, and then a spot for someone else who\u2019s not the mayor,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very tired way of looking at things, that in fact doesn\u2019t reflect the hopefulness and the optimism that people have on the ground for what we could be as a city.\u201cBoston is not reaching our potential,\u201d Wu added. \u201cAnd this race is not is about the leadership of one single person in that conversation \u2026 and what their specific background or identity or experiences are, that makes them the best able to make an individual decision about what should happen. ... It is very much about who is ready and able to be a platform for every person in Boston to see themselves having a role in shaping the future of our city.\u201d In other words, nearly three months into the campaign, Campbell and Wu are defining themselves very differently. Campbell is the native daughter of Boston who can reckon with the city\u2019s challenges because she\u2019s lived with them firsthand for decades. Wu is the populist visionary who rejects conventional political wisdom and sees herself as a conduit for change. If you\u2019re hearing these pitches for the first time, rest assured: a lot of other people probably are, too.Both Wu and Campbell say that because of national politics and the pandemic, their campaigns started differently than they might have in a more ordinary, less overwhelming year.\u201cOf course, during the presidential election, there\u2019s been an extra layer of complication,\u201d Wu said.Wu responded to this, in part, by turning her weekly campaign meet-ups \u2014 a.k.a \u201cWu Wednesdays\u201d \u2014 into phone banks for candidates in other races, in Massachusetts and elsewhere. And Campbell says the tenor of her launch was muted to reflect the fraught moment we\u2019re in.\u201cWhen we were planning our announcement, and what that would look like, we probably would have had it be bigger, and included more people, including many of my civic leaders and residents in my district,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cBut because of COVID, because of the guidelines and precautions we all should be taking, we had to tone that down.\u201cWe had to tone down even the message,\u201d she added. \u201cWe might have wanted to say more, but we wanted to be mindful of the fact that people are still suffering in many ways.\u201dStill, both candidates have been campaigning in earnest. They\u2019ve introduced themselves to voters in virtual or socially distant settings; rolled out endorsements (Wu has been backed by former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jay Gonzalez, Campbell by former Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral); and asked supporters for money they\u2019ll need to reach the mayor\u2019s office.Walsh has been fundraising in earnest, too, even though he\u2019s still not officially in the race. Case in point: a recent, virtual \u201cWomen For Walsh\u201d event at which the mayor raised more than $100,000. During that event, attendees watched a slick video that detailed Walsh\u2019s efforts to increase gender equity in Boston \u2014 and suggested, subtly, that some potential benefits of a Wu or Campbell mayoralty were already being reaped by Bostonians.\u201cAt the New England Women\u2019s Leadership Awards, there was a woman that was with the mayor, and she was a woman of color, so that really stuck with me,\u201d a young Black woman said at one point. \u201cBecause that\u2019s women of color helping people that are running a whole city. Just really inspiring. Really touching.\u201d That fundraiser is one of several indications Walsh is highly likely to seek a third term. Since mid-September, Walsh has raised more than $700,000, leaving him with nearly $6 million cash on hand, according to the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance. (Wu and Campbell currently have less than $500,000 each.)Walsh has also publicly downplayed the idea of a post in the Biden administration. GBH News has spoken with multiple individuals who say the mayor has told them he is planning to run again.If he does, that will mean a preliminary election for him, Wu and Campbell next September \u2014 with the top two finishers, whoever they are, advancing to a November final.",

      "body": "Even after federal investigators alleged that the Massachusetts Department of Corrections violates the constitutional rights of inmates by failing to supervise mentally ill inmates and forcing lengthy mental health-watches in restrictive housing, prisoner advocates say no changes have been made to correct the problems.Gov. Charlie Baker said Nov. 18, the day after the federal investigation from U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling was released, that \"this is a fail that needs to get fixed.\"\"A lot of that stuff that he recommends and his folks recommend, it came out of dialog and conversation's taking place with DOC over the course of the investigation,\" Baker said, adding that the Executive Office of Health and Human Services is also involved.But Elizabeth Matos from Prisoners' Legal Services, a corrections watchdog group, says there's no evidence the Department of Corrections has changed anything.\"As far as we can see through interviews with our clients, I don't know that any significant changes have actually been implemented yet,\" Matos told GBH News.The federal investigation insisted, against a penalty of legal action against the state, that Massachusetts prisons add mental health clinicians and supervision to better monitor inmates under mental health watch.Rep. Ruth Balser was surprised by the feds' findings since she says there are already laws in Massachusetts regarding mental health care in prisons.\"What's very alarming about the report is it does not sound like these policies that were enacted by the Legislature are being followed in our state prisons,\" Balser said.The Department of Corrections would not comment on any changes they've made since the federal report, saying only that they have implemented additional training to staff, intervention plans for inmates that harm themselves, and have stopped selling razors to inmates at some facilities, which the report criticized.In a statement from Nov. 17, Department of Correction spokesperson Jason Dobson wrote the department \"has already begun to address the issues raised in the report and maintain the significant progress we have already made.\"\"The Department remains deeply committed to the health and well-being of all entrusted to our care and fully invested in protecting their physical safety and civil rights,\" Dobson wrote.Like Matos, Sen. Cindy Freidman (D-Arlington) says there's no reason to believe DOC has taken any major steps to increase care for the mentally ill and suicidal.\"And what my experience tells me is that I don't expect to see it. And if you're telling me that the thing you did was take a razor away from somebody who was seriously ill or suicidal, that's what you think is providing people with good care. You've got to be kidding,\" Friedman said.Baker requested $730 million dollars for prisons in this year's budget, but Democrats cut that to under $688 million in their final spending plan.",

      "body": "Massachusetts hospitals are beginning to scale back elective procedures in an effort to free up beds as coronavirus pushes hospitals towards capacity.Because of reduced capacity, hospitals in all but the western third of the state were moved this week into the second of four tiers in a plan for dealing with a surge COVID patients.\"The practical implications, unfortunately, mean that hospitals are getting ... stretched to a very concerning point,\" said Dr. Paul Biddinger, medical director for Emergency Preparedness at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"Unfortunately, what we're hearing from others is what we're experiencing ourselves, which is we're getting really full. We're really getting strained. \"We continue to see rising numbers of COVID patients,\" he continued. \"And that means at some point, unfortunately, you have to defer other care in order to make sure you have hospital beds, ICU beds and available staff. So moving into Tier 2 is a recognition that all hospitals or many hospitals in each of the regions are under significant strain.\"Four of the state's five regions are now at Tier 2. That means the seven-day average of the number of available ICU and medical/surgical beds in those regions was less than 25 percent for five consecutive days.ModuleThe development comes as another 5,192 cases of COVID-19 were reported on Friday. Biddinger said there were just over 90 COVID-19 patients at Mass General in Boston Friday morning, including many in the ICU.\"We have only a couple of open ICU beds and only a couple of beds overall that are open in the hospital,\" Biddinger said, adding that the number continually fluctuates as they admit and discharge patients. But, he said, the number of patients with COVID-19 is \"continually rising.\"The state doesn't mandate what kind of care should be deferred to create more capacity for COVID-19 patients. Under the plan, each hospital has determined its own steps for opening up more beds.For now, Biddinger says MGH is focusing on deferring things like inpatient cosmetic procedures that have the least health consequence. Just because a procedure is deemed elective, he said, doesn't mean it's not important.\"If someone doesn't get a cardiac catheterization, doesn't get a stent, they may not need it immediately,\" he said. \"However, the longer you go without that procedure, the greater risk you're facing. So we've tried really hard in the hospital system and we've actually worked really well with our health department to try and avoid getting to that kind of circumstance.\"That's why the system is phased, he said. If the state were to get to Tier 3 or 4, more serious procedures would be deferred. Health experts fear a coming surge of patients will lead to just that. Massachusetts set a new record on Thursday for the number of newly reported COVID-19 cases \u2014 6,477 were recorded \u2014 breaking the previous record set just the day before by more than 1,800 cases. And public health experts say an increase in hospitalizations tends to lag an increase in confirmed cases by about two weeks.While a spike in cases has been predicted as a result of Thanksgiving celebrations, some public health experts say it may be too soon to see those new cases reflected in the state total.That means a new surge could be coming on top of the one we're already seeing, said epidemiologist Michael Mina of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"Prior to Thanksgiving, we were already in an exponential explosion of cases,\" Mina said. \"We anticipate that the people who got infected, for example, on Thursday, they should generally be starting to show their symptoms over the last couple of days. There's usually another few days delay before people arrive in the hospital. So I would say that right now is the time to start watching for that.\"And with more holidays on the way, public health experts worry there could be yet another surge.\"What we would see in the next one week or two weeks, it's the damage that has already been done. So that cannot be controlled,\" said Jagpreet Chhatwal, associate director of the Institute for Technology Assessment at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"But around the Christmas holidays ... we still have an opportunity to minimize the damage by taking appropriate social distancing precautions, common sense measures. That will be very useful.\"Dr. Shira Doron, hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center said she's worried about a coming surge of patients infected over Thanksgiving.\"Every health care worker's biggest fear in this is having to choose between one person and another for care,\" Doron said. \"And we didn't really get there with the first surge. And so our worry, and what we lose sleep over, is that we will get there with this one, that it will be worse and we will get to the point where we have to choose which person gets medical treatment.\"Over the next couple of weeks, she said, hospitals will have to watch carefully if they have enough beds and staff.\"Will we be asking people to take care of a number of patients that's not safe, that they can't handle, that overwhelms them?\" she asked. \"Will our health care workers stay healthy and able and mentally well? And then if we have the staff but not the beds, where will we put them physically?\" Doron said unlike the last surge, they're not as worried about having enough PPE and ventilators.\"But, you know, there are lots of other little items that that keep giving us heartburn when they don't come in as shipped, periodically,\" she said.",

      "body": "President-elect Joe Biden on Monday announced the team he wants to have lead his response to the nation's greatest public health crisis in a century after he takes office in January.Biden said in a statement that he will nominate Xavier Becerra to lead the sprawling Health and Human Services department. Becerra is California's attorney general and has led prominent legal fights against President Trump's efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Becerra would be the first Latino to lead HHS, the Biden transition team said in a statement.Biden said he would nominate Dr. Rochelle Walensky as the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Walensky is chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a Harvard Medical School professor.Biden selected Jeff Zients to be the White House coordinator of the coronavirus response, a point person for efforts by agencies and state and local governments on vaccine distribution and supply chain issues. Zients, a veteran of the Obama administration with extensive business ties, is known for having spearheaded the work to fix the healthcare.gov website used to sign up for Obamacare after its disastrous rollout in 2013.Biden also said he would nominate Dr. Vivek Murthy as Surgeon General. Murthy has been a key coronavirus adviser to Biden, regularly briefing him on the pandemic during his campaign and the transition. Murthy was Surgeon General during the Obama administration.Murthy faced pushback when Obama nominated him for the job after the National Rifle Association raised alarms about his support for an assault weapons ban. In his confirmation hearing, when asked about this, Murthy insisted he intended to use his platform as Surgeon General not to push for gun control but to draw attention to obesity prevention. Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, director of the Equity Research and Innovation Center at Yale School of Medicine, will lead a new task force aimed at reducing disparities in response, care and treatment for COVID-19, the Biden team said.The appointments help round out Biden's team charged with addressing the pressing COVID-19 crisis. On Thursday Biden announced Dr. Anthony Fauci would continue his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases while also serving as his chief medical adviser on COVID-19.

      "body": "Even as Massachussets sees an increase in COVID-19 cases, state officials continue to push school districts toward in-person learning models. Several districts across the state, including Cambridge and Framingham, have decided to move to remote learning, and most students in Boston are still learning online depsite the push to get more of the district's high-need students back to the classroom. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Boston City Councilor Annissa Essaibi-George about why she agrees with getting students back to in-person learning, and how the city is working to get there safely. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: Should more kids be back in school right now? Where is your thought on this? Are you getting more worried about these numbers? Councilor Annissa Essaibi-George: Yeah, I'm certainly worried about the numbers, and we need to make sure that we have front and foremost of our mind this public health crisis and doing the work [to keep people] safe across the district. You mentioned that I'm a former teacher [and now] chair of the city council's education committee. I'm also the parent of four BPS kids and my high schoolers \u2014 I have four of them \u2014 they are sort of along the spectrum of finding success in this school year. I'm anxious about it. I want our kids back in school. I want our highest needs kids back in school and I want our babies, our little ones, back in school. I'm really just concerned about their health and also concerned about their well-being not being in school. Mathieu: So why are they not? Essaibi-George: Well, they're not because they're trying to keep them safe. But I think we're trying to balance the public health crisis and the real need for our students to be able to achieve academically. We need to make sure that our buildings are in better shape, and we're working and the district is working every single day, and the superintendent I know is almost singularly focused on reopening our schools because we know that that's where our children should be and that's where our kids belong. We're working towards that every single day. Mathieu: So I guess the question is, then, what's the threshold? Obviously, this is something that you'd like to see happen. And if you're working towards it, is it about getting buildings to a certain state? Is it about getting transmission levels to a certain number, or is it more complicated? Essaibi-George: It's really about all of those things. There are some really complex issues, as you mentioned, making these decisions \u2014 making sure that our transmission rate is low, making sure that our hospital numbers are low, our ICU numbers are low \u2014 and making sure that we have the pieces in place for students who need to be in school so that they can be in school, and that teachers have the equipment and the tools and the resources they need to provide that in person in the classroom academic experience. Watch: \"Too many of our kids need to be in the classroom, and they aren't right now.\"Raw HtmlMathieu: The governor has pointed to data showing of low levels of spread in the school setting and using that as a baseline to encourage school districts to look at their own numbers and prepare to reopen and bring kids back into classrooms. I wonder, though, Councilor, if you're worried about winter. Obviously, we want to have the windows open and we want to have classrooms outdoors, if we can. In trying to deal with the throes of winter when cases are rising, doors and windows are closed [and] the heat's pumping. Is that a good time to go back? Essaibi-George: There is lots of reasons to not go back and lots of reasons to go back. For me, it's about balancing those two things that are, unfortunately, often in direct conflict with one another. But I think about our kids who are most at need, our kids who are living in unstable environments, our students who are experiencing homelessness, our kids who are in desperate need of the resources that come with being in the classroom, kids who can't access the curriculum through a Chromebook because they are non-verbal, because they have a high level of disability, because they have a great need to be in person, in the classroom. The opportunity for the hybrid, opting into the classroom gives families some options, and working in partnership with our teachers, creating the safest environments that we can create for our kids to get them back into school as quickly as possible. Mathieu: I'd like to ask you about a hearing that's happening tonight. As you are chairing the education committee, you're the person to talk to you about what is called an ethnic studies curriculum. All of the members of the council, I believe, to sign a letter supporting this idea. There's a lot that goes into this. What is it you're proposing? Essaibi-George: Yeah, so the Boston Teachers Union, as well as the district, have been working on this ethnic studies curriculum to bring to all of our students across all of our grade levels. We had a conversation on Facebook Live last week with one of the teachers, Katie Lee, who has designed in this curriculum for the district and who has been working with teachers to train them on bringing ethnic studies into their classroom so that we are making sure that our kids are having a much fuller experience, especially when they think about history, especially when they think about their space in this city, in this country, in this world. And for me, the most important piece of bringing ethnic studies to our students, to our schools, is that our young people get to learn about and with each other about their own stories, about their existence [and] how they came to be. As the daughter of immigrants, this is really exciting because I haven't in my own life spent enough time thinking about my own story, my own place in this city and in this world. So for me, I'm really excited about this hearing tonight because there is a lot of momentum to bring this to our schools and a meaningful way [and] to bring this to our kids in a meaningful way. And I think that having this hearing, especially today [and] especially during this pandemic, reminds us all that as we're dealing with the challenges of this pandemic, the work continues. There is so much that we need to be doing in our schools around curriculum design [and] around creating greater access to academic opportunities. This topic this evening, I think displays that for sure. ",

      "body": "Dr. Elizabeth Pinsky said she is confounded by Gov. Charlie Baker's continued stance that restaurants and retail stores can remain open while Massachusetts schools have overwhelmingly been forced online.\"I cannot wrap my brain around that decision not to be scaling back right now,\" Pinsky, a child psychologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, told Boston Public Radio on Monday. \"We know that indoor, masks-down eating and drinking with people who are not in your household is dangerous. The decision to leave those things open \u2014 I understand it's complicated, and I am incredibly sympathetic to small businesses \u2014 (but) those things need to shut down. It doesn't matter what we're doing with schools.\"Pinsky said she has seen a rise in children experiencing anxiety and depression, as well as an increase in children entering the emergency room in crisis with thoughts of self-harm and suicidal ideations.\"All of those things have been as bad as we thought they would be, and in some cases worse than we thought they would be,\" she said.Pinsky's comments come as COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations continue to rise in Massachusetts, placing increased pressure on Gov. Charlie Baker to institute new restrictions.Pinsky argued for a level of urgency in responding to this new wave of cases.\"My own opinion as someone who works in the hospital, sometimes in the emergency room, we need to close (other indoor environments) because people are going to die,\" not just because schools need to reopen, she said.Given that there are ways to mitigate risks in schools \u2014 like rigorous mask-wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing \u2014 Pinsky said there is little evidence of community spread stemming from schools compared to things like restaurants.Citing the educational and emotional impact of the pandemic, including long-term remote learning, Pinsky said she is frustrated that schools have remained largely closed while other aspects of society have continued to operate, such as restaurants, malls and casinos.\"At a certain point, you need to say that (schools) should be last things to close and first things to open, because they are so low risk compared to other indoor environments,\" she said. She rejected the notion that closing schools is a meaningful way to stem the spread, noting Cambridge Public Schools' recent decision to shift to one week of fully remote learning due to a jump in COVID-19 cases in the city.\"Because transmissions are so low in schools, that's going to have very little impact on the rates in Cambridge,\" she said. \"Shutting the schools is not going to be the thing that turns things around in Cambridge. To do that and leave other things open is neither good for children nor is it (an) effective public health intervention.\"As for the mental health of those dealing with long-term remote learning, Pinsky offered some seemingly simple but oft-overlooked advice for parents of young children: take care of yourself first \u2014 make sure you're getting adequate sleep and exercise \u2014 so you are better equipped to respond to your children's needs.",

Charlie Baker is coming under mounting pressure from public health experts and municipal leaders to do more to control the dramatic increase in coronavirus cases.Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said in a tweet over the weekend that while he has defended Baker's response in the past, he's \u201caghast\" at the lack of action over the past six weeks and called for tighter restrictions.\u201cOver the last six weeks it's become very clear that we are heading towards a really bad surge of infections ... and the response from the governor's office has been wholly inadequate,\" he said.Jha said hospitalizations and deaths are on the rise, yet \u201ccasinos and tanning salons are still open.\u201dThe state on Sunday reported more than 4,700 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Massachusetts has risen over the past two weeks from almost 2,654 on Nov. 22 to more than 4,554 on Sunday, according to the COVID Tracking Project.Some municipal leaders are open to more business closures but say it can't be done piecemeal. If restaurants in one city are closed, people will simply go to another town.Lynn Mayor Thomas McGee is in favor of what calls a \u201creasonable rollback\" but said the state must lead.\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak for the administration,\u201d McGee told The Boston Globe, but \u201cwe can\u2019t make those kinds of decisions individually. ... It can\u2019t be one community here, one community there.\u201dThe Republican governor has said he does not plan any more restrictions.\u201cThere are no imminent new measures,\u201d Baker aide Tim Buckley told the Globe, \u201cbut the administration has long said every option is on the table.\u201d He said current restrictions are in line with federal and global standards.Mask IncentivesTwo U.S. senators from New England want to press more states to institute mask requirements.Sens. Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, and Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, have introduced the Encouraging Masks for All Act.The legislation would provide an additional $5 billion to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for states that implement mask requirements.It would also make $75 million in grants available for states to use to promote mask mandates and provide face coverings to those who need them.Markey said he is \u201cfully supportive\u201d of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s plan to ask Americans to wear masks for 100 days after he takes office in January.\u201cBut we should not wait until then to arm ourselves with this protection,\u201d Markey said Friday according to the Boston Herald. \u201cThirteen states across our country still do not have mask mandates in place, and that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d",

Seven percent of respondents said they will never take the vaccines, which are nearing their final approvals with rollouts expected to occur over several months due to supply constraints.The results, according the poll sponsors at the Museum of Science, also highlight important racial differences, with 38 percent of white residents saying they will take the vaccine \"as soon as possible,\" compared to 28 percent of Black residents and 22 percent of residents.The survey, conducted in partnership with the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, highlights a need for doctors, medical experts and others in the scientific community to address two of the biggest concerns among those reluctant to take the vaccine \u2014 65 percent of poll respondents expressed concern that the vaccine has not been thoroughly tested, and 61 percent said they are reluctant to trust the government on health care issues.Noting Black and Latino residents have borne most of the severe health and economic impacts caused by the virus, the poll's sponsors said there's a risk of \"major inequities in wider public vaccination\" and called for stronger communications soon that are focused on communities most in need of the vaccine.Eighty percent of respondents said they trust their doctors to tell them when a vaccine works and is safe, the highest level of trust among any group.\"We are at an exciting moment in our battle against COVID-19 with a multitude of vaccines in development that offer promising results. Now, as we face the push for distribution, this poll has affirmed the importance of building confidence in the science and celebrating the technological advancements that have made way for rapid, safe and effective vaccines,\" said Tim Ritchie, president of the Museum of Science. \"The weeks and months ahead will offer one of the biggest tests, and opportunities, we have faced in science communication, and the results of this poll help us shape our approach.\"Michael Curry, the incoming CEO of the League of Community Health Centers, said the poll showed that many Black and Latino residents \"appreciate that a vaccine can help end this pandemic and save lives\" but also highlighted trust considerations that need to be addressed.\"Addressing vaccine concerns that are rooted in the mistreatment of people of color by the medical establishment over centuries will be a major challenge. From being denied access to quality, affordable health care under Jim Crow to being enrolled in medical experiments without their consent, Black Americans, in particular, do not trust that our healthcare system has their best interests at heart,\" he said. \"Community health centers look forward to leveraging our unique knowledge and understanding of these communities to help them feel more confident in making decisions during this unprecedented public health emergency.\"The Baker administration submitted an initial COVID-19 vaccine order to the federal government Friday. TPoll: Many Want to Wait to Take COVID-19 Vaccinehe state expects to receive 300,000 first doses by the end of December, with health care workers at the front of the line to receive them, followed by long-term care facilities.\"We have a comprehensive plan to distribute the vaccine in a safe and effective manner. And we'll plan to share more details with you on this on Wednesday,\" Baker said Monday. He added, \"Even with vaccines coming to Massachusetts and other places around the country, we still have a long way to go.\"The poll surveyed 1,180 residents, including oversamples of Black and Latino residents. It was conducted in English and Spanish from November 18 \u2013 25.",

      "body": "Mirna Hernandez traveled from Guatemala to the United States at age 23 and took the first job she could find: housekeeping at the Revere Hotel on the Boston Common. Thirty-five years later, Hernandez found herself in the same position; working a job she liked and was good at, with no plans to retire. \u201cYou give me a job, and I will work,\u201d the now 59-year-old Hernandez told GBH News. Even when the pandemic hit the hotel industry in March, representatives from the hotel and its parent group, HEI Hotels and Resorts, reassured Hernandez and her furloughed colleagues that their jobs would be waiting for them. \u201cYour date of hire will remain the same, since HEI recognizes your past service at the hotel,\u201d Nigel Hurst of HEI Hotels wrote in a May 24 letter to staff, obtained by GBH News. \u201cWe understand you have many questions regarding this transition and want to assure you we will provide you with extensive information once you have been recalled to work.\u201d That's when a surge of mass layoffs began at hotels across the city. The Four Seasons on Boylston Street fired nearly half its staff without severance packages, and only offered severance packages after massive public pressure. In the fall, Boston Marriott Copley Place terminated half of its staff, with reduced severance packages. And in November, Hernandez and more than 100 of her coworkers, many of whom had also served at the hotel for decades, received letters of termination. \u201cWe will be using the end of this year, December 31, to rescind earlier messaging on rehiring employees who were employed at the hotel prior to the HEI Hotels and Resorts transition,\u201d the letter from a Revere Hotel human resources director reads. \u201c... when business does return to our hotel later in the year, we will post job openings to the public and if you are interested in applying at that time we will be happy to consider your application as a potential new hire.\u201d \u201cFor 35 years, I gave my all. I have never had a warning, this is the only job I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cTo get a letter like that, not even a personal call \u2014 I'm just so shocked and disappointed.\u201dHernandez says she has struggled to eat and sleep. She has spent the past two weeks applying for cleaning jobs at hospitals and schools, but nothing has looked promising. \u201cI need my job to pay my rent, to pay my bills,\u201d the Dorchester resident said. \u201cI am worried I\u2019m too old to get hired anywhere, nobody is looking for someone like me.\u201d Hotel union Unite Here Local 26 doesn\u2019t represent the unemployed Revere Hotel workers but is helping them in the wake of what Local 26 President Carlos Aramayo calls a \u201cconcerning trend.\u201d \u201cThere are hundreds of workers in multiple properties now who are being fired and told they have to reapply,\u201d Aramayo told GBH News. \u201cMy concern is, when they do apply, these employers are going to lower wages and lower benefit costs. I think it's disgusting and deeply cynical that these hotels are using the pandemic for their own economic gain.\u201d Hotel occupancy is down 24 percent as compared to the same time last year, and seven out of 10 hotels across the country say they won\u2019t survive another six months without further stimulus financing from the government, according to a November survey from the American Hotel and Lodging Association. But hotels also have had unique access to federal stimulus benefits that businesses in some other industries could not apply for, including a provision in the March CARES Act that if a company owns multiple hotels, even if the hotel chain has more than 500 employees, it would still be able to qualify for small business benefits offered in the $2 trillion stimulus package. \u201cThis is an industry that has already benefited from one bailout, it's asking to benefit from the next bailout and frankly, it costs zero dollars to make a commitment that if someone\u2019s job is recreated, they get that job back,\u201d Aramayo said. \u201cThe only reason I could see that a hotel would want to do this is that they want to hire a different person, maybe a younger person, maybe a person who is not a person of color.\u201d Revere Hotel and HEI Hotels and Resorts did not respond to requests for comment. Despite the recent trend of layoffs, a few Boston hotels have promised their employees their jobs back post-pandemic, including Boston Park Plaza and the Lenox Hotel on Boylston Street. The Lenox has reduced their on-site capacity to a \u201cskeleton staff,\u201d but plans to bring back every employee when it is safe to do so, according to Daniel Donahue, the president of the Saunders Hotel Group, which includes the Lenox. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the Revere did this, they\u2019re cutting off their lifeline of what their success has been,\u201d Donahue told GBH News. \u201cWe will never turn our back on the employees that have made us what we are, and they will help us get out of this quicker than anybody else.\u201d Aramayo says he struggles to understand how this move will benefit hotels in the long term. \u201cI'm not sure why they're trying to restructure their labor cost, probably because they want to pay off their debt burden or something like that,\u201d Aramayo said. \u201cBut those are not the people who make the hospitality industry. All the value is created by the people that work there, the room attendant who keeps your room clean, the bartender who tells you where to visit in Boston and serves you a second drink. Those are the people who make up the hospitality industry, they are the hospitality.\u201d ",

      "body": "Gov. Baker's move Tuesday to roll back the state's reopening plan is being seen as an inadequate response to spiking COVID-19 rates by some public health experts and other critics.\"We have to take action right now,\" said Samuel Scarpino, who directs the Emergent Epidemics Lab at Northeastern University. \"We're running out of options to prevent the hospitals from being overwhelmed.\"Baker announced Tuesday that the state would revert to stage one of the third phase of the state's reopening plan, beginning on Sunday. That change will close indoor performance venues and indoor recreation businesses, as well as reducing the capacity allowed at gyms, libraries, places of worship, and other public venues. Scarpino said the move doesn't step far enough back.\"I think the kind of restrictions that we need would look something like a hybrid between phase one and phase two, where we have really very strict limits on the number of individuals that can be inside of an enclosed space that's outside of their household, and where we look very, very carefully at any situation where people are going to have masks off, like dining,\" Scarpino said.The rollback allows indoor dining at restaurants to continue, but restaurants won't be allowed to seat more than six people at a table \u2014 down from the previous limit of 10 patrons at a table.Module\"Indoor dining has been shown in national data to be a high risk activity,\" said Carlene Pavlos, executive director of the Massachusetts Public Health Association. \"So it's not at all clear that why the governor would stop short of halting indoor dining altogether.\"The new state order also imposes a 90-minute time limit on seating at indoor tables, which Pavlos said she doesn't understand.\"COVID is certainly transmissible within 90 minutes,\" Pavlos said. \"It's not at all clear that there is a scientific basis for that kind of a decision. ... At a point where we have community transmission rates as high as we do right now in the state of Massachusetts, indoor dining should simply be stopped.\"For the state's restaurant industry, Baker's announcement is a relief. Bob Luz, president & chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Restaurant Association said 97 percent of state inspections have shown restaurants in full compliance with pandemic protocols.\"Restaurants are not the problem, which is what [Baker has] continued to say. And he's not going to close it just because someone says you should close it,\" Luz said. \"If the data says, if the science says that that needs to happen, then I think he'll do it. It says just the opposite.\"For Cassandra Pierre, acting hospital epidemiologist and medical director of public health programs at Boston Medical Center, the governor's announcement drew muted praise.\"I give it a golf clap,\" she said. \"And I think that we need to keep going.\"Pierre said the rollbacks seems like a compromise.\"I feel like this might be a way to appease sides, you know,\" she said. \"Appease the medical community that's been calling for many of these rollbacks and also appease, understandably, people who are trying to continue to maintain their livelihoods,\" she said. \"But I don't know whether it really, with the exception of gyms, reduces our risk. And so I remain worried.\"Gyms are among the facilities that must cut capacity to 40 percent, and patrons must now wear masks at all times. Guidance from last month allowed customers to skip face coverings if they maintained a distance of 14 feet.Some nurses in the state were hoping to hear Baker announce new PPE requirements for hospitals. That's among a range of steps the Massachusetts Nurses Association has been calling for to protect the health of front-line healthcare workers.\"I want him to state that we \u2014 the nurses and the health care professionals that are in direct patient care, working in our hospitals \u2014 should be issued a new N95 mask at the beginning of every shift that they're working,\" said Kathy Reardon, a nurse at Morton Hospital in Taunton.Baker made no such statement Tuesday. Reardon said she and many other nurses are frequently re-using N95 masks.\"If we request one, we can get one,\" Reardon said. \"But they should just be automatically issued.\"Baker's announcement was also met with sharp criticism from the Massachusetts Teacher's Association.\"Massachusetts educators need swift, systemic action by the state,\" MTA President Merrie Najimy said in a written statement. \"That begins with the state supplying comprehensive surveillance testing in every school. As students have returned after the Thanksgiving holiday, there is no surveillance testing program to determine whether anyone getting on the bus and walking through the school doors is a carrier, potentially an asymptomatic one.\"Last week, officials told GBH News the state has deployed rapid mobile testing in 13 Massachusetts communities.In her statement, Najimy refered to that testing program as \"wholly inadequate.\"",

      "body": "Updated at 3:30 p.m.The first COVID-19 vaccines given in Massachusetts will go to medical workers on the front lines of the epidemic beginning this month, with first responders and residents of elder care homes, homeless shelters and prisons also near the front of the line.Gov. Charlie Baker laid out details of his three-phase plan to distribute the vaccines when they become available at his daily coronavirus press conference Wednesday at the State House. After all three phases of the plan are complete, Baker hopes the majority of the state's population will have access to the vaccine by April.\"Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines take about six weeks to provide a person with immunity from the virus,\" Baker said. \"That means that while the first doses will be administered shortly, we're several months away from safely vaccinating a majority of the people of Massachusetts.\"Phase one of the vaccine plan calls for clinical and non-clinical health care workers on the front lines of COVID care to receive shots first, then residents of long-term care and rest facilities, first responders, residents of correctional facilities and homeless shelters, home-based health care workers and those providing non-COVID-19 care. The state's first order is forl 60,000 doses. Phase one is expected to require 300,000 doses.Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said she was thrilled by the recommendation of Baker's COVID advisory group to include prisons and homeless shelters among other congregate care settings, like elder care facilities, where residents are particularly vulnerable.\"From an equity perspective, where people are together and at risk in the same situation, we felt it was really important to prioritize that group,\" said Dr. Paul Biddinger, the chair of the advisory group and director of the Center for Disaster Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.Inoculating prisoners before some other portions of the population sparked a degree of outrage in Colorado, where Gov. Jared Polis took issue with the recommendations of his own vaccination task force. One fear, as The Colorado Sun reported at the time, is that an outbreak in a prison, where there is little ability to social distance, could spark a wider outbreak in the community at large.The second phase of the Massachusetts rollout plan, estimated to come in February, will include people at the highest risk of complications from COVID-19, along with teachers, transit workers, grocery store employees and public health workers. Later in phase two, which is estimated to run through April, vaccinations will include those over 65 and those with lower but still significant risk of complications.Nearly 2 million doses of the vaccine will be included in the second phase.Boston Public School Superintendent Brenda Cassellius welcomed the news that pre-k and k-12 teachers and staff will be part of the second phase of vaccinations while appearing on GBH News' Boston Public Radio on Wednesday.Phase three, when the general public will receive vaccination, will start in April, according to Baker's plan. By then, the state hopes enough vaccine will be manufactured to supply the rest of the state's over-18 population \u2014 around 5.8 million people.\"It's still too early, and there are too many variables that are still being worked out, to say exactly when this stage of the process would get underway. But our estimate is that this segment of the population could start getting vaccinated sometime in the spring,\" Baker said.Baker is prioritizing communities of color in the phase-three distribution timeline and said he'll be focusing intently on reaching that population and making clear that vaccines are safe and effective.\"Communities of color and at-risk populations will be prioritized throughout this process in order to preserve life and prevent serious complications from COVID-related illnesses,\" the Rev. Liz Walker, senior pastor at Roxbury Presbyterian Church, said at the news conference.Walker admitted that some Black and Latino communities may be initially distrustful of the vaccine's effectiveness. \"I think there's a lot of skepticism still,\" Walker said. \"It's going to take a lot of work.\"",

      "body": "Boston Public Schools plan to invite even more students back into the classroom after 1,700 students return to in-person learning next week, Superintendent Brenda Cassellius told Boston Public Radio on Wednesday.\"We continue to work with our high-priority task force. That will continue to meet until all (high-priority) students are back in school, which we\u2019re hoping to do after the winter break, then to begin to open our phased-in model/plan that we had for October 1,\" Cassellius said. Next, pre-kindergarteners would return as soon as safely possible.The district's plan to reopen school buildings has been approved by the Boston Public Health Commission, Cassellius said, and includes safety precautions like 4,800 new air purifier units, additional personal protective equipment for teachers and more testing. Last week, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he did not think more schools would reopen until after the winter break. Now, 32 buildings will be open as of next week, with nearly 2,000 of the district's more than 50,000 students set to return to some in-person learning.After Boston's positive COVID-19 rates jumped to above 5 percent in October, the city reverted to fully remote learning. Currently, fewer than a total of 200 students are learning in person in four regular public schools. As of Dec. 3, the city's positivity rate was 6.9 percent, according to city data. In some neighborhoods, including East Boston, Dorchester and Hyde Park, the rate is much higher.Still, Cassellius said the emotional and academic detriments from long-term remote learning outweigh the risks of transmission in schools. The evidence on school transmission is mixed, and it varies by grade level. \"We\u2019re often asked the question are school spaces safer somehow than a restaurant or our homes,\" she said. \"It\u2019s really that in schools we\u2019re rule followers. We have a lot of rules and protocols and routines we do with children, so staff is more accustomed to enforcing those rules.\"Cassellius said even with positive news around vaccine distribution, educators and families will be living with COVID-19 for many more months. Still, she believes that schooling needs to continue.\"We have to mitigate the risk the best we can. We have to balance that with the fact that children don't get another chance at their childhood,\" she said, while acknowledging that the response from parents remains split.\"We are a really 50-50 camp here, we have half of our parents wanting to come and half not,\" she said.",

      "body": "As coronavirus cases explode across Massachusetts, the worst could be yet to come, according to Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes. \"I don't think that we're quite seeing the Thanksgiving surge yet,\" Kuritzkes, the chief of the infectious diseases division at Brigham and Women's Hospital, told GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath.Kuritzkes' comments come as Gov. Charlie Baker moves Massachusetts back a step in its reopening after some strong criticism. Below is a transcript of Kuritzkes and Rath's conversation about the rollback and other aspects of the pandemic. It has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: For much of the past week, the state's Department of Public Health has been reporting more than 4,000 new cases of coronavirus in Massachusetts each day. With this rollback to step one, phase three of the reopening - we're talking about limiting indoor capacity to 40 percent of restaurants and offices, places like that, capping outdoor gatherings at 50 rather than 100 people - is that enough to stem this wave that we're seeing right now? Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes: I think we're really going to have to see what impact these new restrictions have. What's most important, really, is that people have to wear their masks consistently and reliably, and that is emphasized in the order from the governor.Rath: The governor and others have been tying these skyrocketing case numbers to Thanksgiving gatherings and travel - maybe not so much travel across borders, but people going to households that are not their own. Do you agree that that that's been a big part of this? Kuritzkes: I do think that there's good evidence that the majority of the cases we're seeing are the result of household transmissions, not so much transmissions outside the household. Rath: We're facing the holidays. There's Haunkkah this week, and we have Christmas after that, Kwanzaa, after that the new year. If things are going up right now, thanks in part to Thanksgiving, there are just a lot more opportunities potentially for indoor gatherings in the next several weeks. How concerned are you about that? Kuritzkes: I am concerned that the holiday season could further fuel the current surge that we're seeing. I don't think that we're quite seeing the Thanksgiving surge yet. It's just the very beginning of that, and so things really could snowball. I just think people are going to have to be very patient and willing to ride out this holiday season in the hopes that the holidays to come are going to be much more enjoyable than this year. Rath: I want to talk over some of the vaccine news that we've also been getting lately. Honestly, I went into this past weekend feeling more optimistic, then a little bit less optimistic about things as more details came out. Probably the first thing to talk about is, it seems that there may not be in the first round as many doses coming to the states as we first thought. Kuritzkes: Well, I think we always anticipated that there would be enough vaccine to dose thousands, tens of thousands of people, but not hundreds of thousands of people, in the in the initial weeks, with much more vaccine to become available in the following weeks. Rath: One aspect I'm especially curious about with an infectious disease expert - we've been hearing about, in terms of the problem of distributing a vaccine during a pandemic, not just the logistical issues of it, but that if we don't have our infection rate down, even with the vaccine, we're still looking at a potentially very brutal winter and spring. Kuritzkes: I think that's true. Even if we are able to get 30,000 people vaccinated in the next couple of weeks, that's a real drop in the bucket. We are still going to depend on people wearing masks, doing the physical distancing, limiting their gatherings indoors and the like for the foreseeable future until the majority of the population is vaccinated. Rath: In terms of what will be available, how do you see that rollout going with where our numbers are right now? When do you think that we will start to see the effect of the vaccine?Kuritzkes: The individuals who are vaccinated are going to be protected beginning about a month to five weeks after they themselves get the vaccine, but I don't think we're going to see an impact on the epidemic itself until well into the spring. I hope that before that, we'll see a reduction in cases because people will be following the advice from the governor's order and being more cautious about their activities. Rath: As an infectious disease expert, obviously you can't you can't wave a wand, but what would be your ideal be for where the infection rate would be when we are able to start vaccinating people? Kuritzkes: I'd like to see our positivity rate back down to one percent or less, the way we were over the summer. I don't think that's a necessary precondition for vaccination. It just means that without people taking the safeguards that are being recommended, vaccination alone is not going to do the job because it's going to take so much time to get everybody vaccinated. Rath: The other aspect we've been talking about a lot in the last week has been about vaccine skepticism when it comes to that. Could you sort of refresh our memory on that? For the vaccine to be widely effective, how big a percentage of the population would need to have the vaccine by the time that we're finished with this? Kuritzkes: So a quick back of the envelope calculation is that we need about two-thirds of the population to be immune to coronavirus to have so-called herd immunity. Since the vaccine is about 95 percent effective - both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines - then if 70 percent of people got vaccinated, 70 percent times 95 percent is about two-thirds, and that's the magic number. So we need at least 70 percent to accept the vaccine. ",

      "body": "The pandemic has disproportionately impacted communities of color. These are also the same communities who are widely skeptical of receiving a coronavirus vaccine. Hilda Ramirez, executive director of the Latino Education Institute at Worcester State University, participated in Pfizer's vaccine trial to encourage buy-in from the state's Latino community.She says we have to listen to concerns within the community and address those concerns head-on, even if it's uncomfortable.\"Even myself, to be honest with you, I would often say, 'I don't want to get that flu vaccine, because I'm just going to get the flu,'\" said Ramirez. \"And so, I don't know where that comes from ... I just can't tell you where that notion was formulated for me. And I'm the kind of person, that I go to the doctor all the time, I do all the things that I have to do, I'm fairly healthy. But, there's definitely some assumptions that have been built into how we grow up where you're like, 'Well I don't know if it'll make it better or worse or give me a cold.'\"Boston City Council President Kim Janey says part of addressing this skepticism means acknowledging past and more recent events that have contributed to those concerns, including the Tuskegee Experiments and the Flint, Michigan, water crisis.\"So there's a lot of history and good reasons why there might be mistrust, that being said, it is critically important that we ensure that the vaccine reaches communities of color, and Black people in particular,\" said Janey. \"We have to deal with and acknowledge the history in our nation when it comes to healthcare, and governments and our relationship to Black people in particular, but to communities of color in general.\"Segments:Councilor Kim Janey - 2:56Hilda Ramirez - 16:54",

      "body": "More BPS students with high needs will return to in-person learning next week, Mayor Marty Walsh announced Thursday.The Mayor said the move was arranged to accommodate families who requested in-person education. As many as 1,700 students could opt in, though attendance is not mandatory.\u201cCurrently, we have a small number of students with complex disabilities learning in-person in four of our schools in Boston,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cBeginning Monday the 14th, an additional 28 schools will open to provide in-person learning opportunities for approximately 1,700 kids.\u201d That brings the total to 32 now in operation.Walsh said the Boston Public School system has made safety adjustments to open, including updated filtration systems and free-standing air purifiers in the buildings without HVAC systems and medical grade personal protective equipment for nurses in each of the schools.\u201cWe obviously have to balance the needs of COVID safety with the duty to educate high-needs students. Those students [needs\u2019] include disabilities and language supports which can only be met in person.\u201dWalsh\u2019s comments came as he announced the city\u2019s latest 394 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases, bringing Boston\u2019s total to 31,086. Seven deaths were also reported Wednesday, bringing the pandemic city toll to 947.East Boston, Hyde Park, and Dorchester remain the hardest hit neighborhood. Walsh mentioned that although cases are rising, Boston\u2019s hospital numbers have \u201cticked up\u201d at a rate sufficiently slow to make the case surge manageable, so far.Marty Martinez, the city\u2019s health and human services chief, explained that his department is monitoring three metrics \u2013 COIVD-positive patients\u2019 emergency department visits, ICU capacity and the availability medical and surgical beds.As of today, the 7-day average ICU usage is about 90 percent.\u201cThat\u2019s higher than it\u2019s been for quite some time,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see it high, we want to see it lower, but our hospitals are managing that.\u201d Martinez said there are about 300 COVID patients in hospitals across Boston right now \u2013 significantly less than during the coronavirus peak in April, when there were 1,600.\u201cAs we live with COVID, we have to make sure our hospitals can take care of people and right now, they can,\u201d he said. Last week concluded the 2020 outdoor dining program. 550 restaurants were approved to seat patrons outside.The 2021 pilot program will begin on April 1, but restaurants can begin applying now, Walsh announced. \u201cStarting next week, we\u2019re going to be hosting virtual help sessions for restaurants who want to apply,\u201d he said.The first session is scheduled for Wednesday, December 16.Walsh also chided Quincy mayor Thomas P. Koch when asked about the pair\u2019s gridlock over the Long Island Bridge.On Wednesday, a Suffolk Superior Court judge nullified a Quincy commission\u2019s denial of Boston\u2019s effort to rebuild the bridge and open an addiction recovery campus on the island.Multiple news outlets have reported the Koch administration\u2019s intention to appeal that ruling. \u201cThe Mayor of Quincy is a friend of mine. I respect the elected officials in Quincy, but this is just simply wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a fight we should be having,\u201d Walsh continued, pointing out that Boston owns Long Island and historically used the site for social services. \u201cI\u2019m excited that a Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the city of Boston. Our goal is to move forward\u2026 and if the first person in line [for the recovery campus] is from the city of Quincy, or the first person in line is from Squantum, they\u2019re more than welcome to come in.\u201d    ",

      "body": "\"This time up, I figured this is kinda my last hurrah,\" said 84-year old Tom Larkin.The Bedford resident has been active in politics since he volunteered for John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in 1960. He figures that he\u2019s cast hundreds \u2014 if not thousands \u2014 of votes in his lifetime. Presidential elections. Municipal elections. There were his years on the town school committee and his decades on the Democratic state committee.But Dec. 14 will be different. On that day, Larkin will be one of six men and five women who will serve as Massachusetts\u2019 11 presidential electors this year. The party whose candidate wins the popular vote in Massachusetts gets to select the state\u2019s presidential electors. So, Massachusetts' 2020 electoral class is comprised of all Democrats \u2014 selected by the Democratic State Committee at a vote in September. They come from a range of backgrounds, and they have a range of motivations to volunteer for the job. But the ones who spoke with GBH News said they're honored to be part of the process \u2014 even if it's a process some of them think should change.\"It\u2019s probably my most important vote of my life,\" Larkin said. \"It\u2019s gonna be a thrill for me.\"The electors say earning a slot is competitive \u2014 there were more than 20 candidates this year\u2014 and it takes some personal campaigning to get the nod.\"I\u2019m reaching the end of the road and kinda representing the activists within the Democratic party over the last 40 to 50 years,\" Larkin said.For Medford lawyer Teresa Walsh, the decision to run for elector this year was less about a lifetime of work and more about this specific presidential election. \"For me it was a very personal thing,\" she explained.Walsh is, among other things, an international election monitor for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. She was in Ukraine overseeing elections there in 2019 when President Donald Trump controversially recalled then-Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, setting off a scandal that would eventually lead to his impeachment. \"I saw first-hand what it did to the embassy in Ukraine when then-President Trump interfered with a fine, career foreign service officer and ambassador,\" she said. \"And I vowed that I would come back to the United States and I would do whatever I could in my power to work for a peaceful transfer of power within the institutions we have here within the United States.\"Hingham\u2019s Joe Kelly, an IBEW Local 103 electrician, also felt compelled to run this year \u2014 not by affairs abroad but by issues closer to home. Kelly is a relative newcomer to politics, and he said his reason for getting active in recent years is simple.\"There\u2019s been a separation between working-class people in this country and the Democratic Party,\" Kelly said. \"My goal was to rebuild that bridge and bring the voice of labor back to the Democratic Party, but also to bring the voice of the Democratic Party back to labor.\"Kelly said there wasn\u2019t a representative from labor among the candidates for the 2020 electoral class, and so he threw his hat in the ring.\"Growing up in an Irish Catholic, blue-collar family in South Boston, it\u2019s gonna be the honor of a lifetime to vote for a guy who grew up with a similar background and is only the second Irish Catholic president in American history,\" he said.American history weighed heavily on Easthampton Mayor Nicolle LaChapelle\u2019s decision to run for elector, too. This year marks the 100th anniversary women earning the right to vote in the U.S.  \"I felt urged on and inspired to participate,\" she said. \"It was kind of my homage to the hundreds of thousands of women who got us to this point.\"Like a number of electors who spoke with GBH News, LaChapelle has her issues with our electoral system and supports the idea of electing the presdient by popular vote. Stlll, she said that doesn\u2019t diminish the gravity of what they are about to undertake.\"I\u2019m honored to be a presidential elector, but we need to continue to evolve,\" LaChapelle said. \"It would be really cool if I were the last electoral college class that was nominating a white man \u2014 and maybe the last electoral college class ever.\"The votes will be cast on Monday at 3 p.m. After that they will be dispatched \u2014  like the 527 other votes from across the country \u2014 to Washington, D.C. Congress will tally them during a joint session on Jan. 6, 2021.",

      "body": "To call it counterintuitive would be an understatement. As COVID cases surge and the state rolls back its reopening, Massachusetts high-school students are poised to resume playing sports like basketball and hockey \u2014 inside. That\u2019s left many parents, including me, wrestling with what could be a very high-stakes decision.For the past few months, our family has been as conservative as possible when it comes to COVID risk. We\u2019ve worn masks everywhere, avoided dining in restaurants, and gotten our groceries delivered or via curbside pickup rather than going into the store.But basketball is my daughter Harriet\u2019s favorite sport. Her school, Swampscott High, hasn\u2019t ruled out playing this winter. (This week, the school committee postponed the season indefinitely, but didn\u2019t cancel it outright.) And if there is a season, she wants to be a part of it.\u201cIf it were up to me, I would go right back to playing basketball \u2014 no hesitation, no questions asked,\u201d she told me this week. \u201cBecause although I\u2019m not, like, this crazy superstar basketball player on the court, it\u2019s a big part of my life, and I enjoy it.\u201d New guidelines from the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association are supposed to make basketball safer during the pandemic. They include rules changes like no jump balls, fewer players rebounding free throws, and a six-foot buffer when a defender guards an inbounds pass. But those proposed changes also drive home the fact that, at its core, basketball is the opposite of socially distant.What\u2019s more, right now, the people who know the most about COVID say we should be reducing or eliminating indoor activity, not expanding it. \u201cIndoor activities where you bring people close together, where you have potentially ventilation issues, you\u2019re going to have the risk of exposure,\u201d said John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and the chief information officer at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cYou start adding those probability events between teams that can come together, there\u2019s a good chance you might have an exposure.\u201dThe game itself is a transmission risk, Brownstein adds \u2014 but so is everything that comes with it. \u201cBeing on the bench, the congregation of parents, the activities that start to pile up,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, it becomes a sort of balance of risk and benefit.\u201d For some families, though, that calculus isn\u2019t as straightforward as it might seem.Niya Morgen used to play with my daughter, but now she\u2019s on different track. She was Swampscott\u2019s starting point guard as a freshman. She hopes to get a scholarship from a Division I school. And she works incredibly hard on her game, spending more than 20 hours a week on the court.\u201cI go to group workouts every day,\u201d she said. \u201cOn my own, I do more moving drills, and I pretend as if there\u2019s a defender in front of me. ... Or I just get shots up, lots of shots, because since I\u2019m small, I need to be able to shoot the ball well.\u201dBeyond that commitment, Johannah Morgen, one of Niya\u2019s moms, says there\u2019s another big factor involved in the family\u2019s thought process: the effect that losing basketball last spring, when sweeping COVID restrictions first went into effect, had on her daughter. \u201cWhen Niya was suddenly excluded from all her activities, she was miserable,\u201d Johannah Morgen said. \u201cAnd my enthusiastic support for her as a basketball player has a lot less to do with her potential as a college player \u2014 that\u2019s her passion, and I\u2019m happy to support it \u2014 and a lot more to do with her general wellbeing. For her to be in a good spot, physically, emotionally, she needs basketball.\u201dThat\u2019s why, if there is a season, Niya\u2019s parents have decided that she\u2019ll be on the court.\u201cWe\u2019re in the fortunate position that no one in our family is high risk, and we can keep our circle pretty constrained outside of her athletics,\u201d Johannah Morgen said. \u201cAnd so we made the choice. We\u2019re not deluding ourselves that there\u2019s no risk, but it\u2019s a level that we\u2019re willing to accept for her to be able to pursue something that is such an intrinsic part of who she is. Some communities are taking that choice out of parents\u2019 hands \u2014 including Lynn, which borders Swampscott to the south and just canceled winter sports.Right now, COVID is hitting Lynn harder than Swampscott. In the state of Massachusetts\u2019 most recent weekly COVID report, Lynn\u2019s two-week average daily incidence rate was 67.6, compared to 36.7 for Swampscott, and the two-week positivity rate per test was 10.23 percent, compared to Swampscott\u2019s 2.58 percent. While Swampscott\u2019s schools are currently hybrid, Lynn\u2019s are remote. But Antonio Anderson, the boys\u2019 basketball coach at perennial powerhouse Lynn English, warned during a recent protest at Lynn City Hall that nixing winter sports could have negative long-term consequences for some students. \u201cThis is my hometown, and playing sports here is what got me out,\u201d said Anderson, who played in college and the NBA,  according to the Daily Item.\u201cThere were a lot of different routes I could\u2019ve taken in life, but playing winter sports allowed me to get a free education at the University of Memphis, get a degree, play professional basketball and then come back to my city and be a positive role model for some of these kids,\u201d he added. \u201c[That\u2019s] why this is so important for these kids. It\u2019s more than just sports.\u201dBrownstein, the epidemiologist at Boston\u2019s Children, cites yet another factor he thinks should be considered: In communities where students are still learning in the classroom, opting out of sports could help keep them there. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this happen where a team will play another team, and one kid turns up positive,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those other kids end up in quarantine and missing in-person learning, and that\u2019s a real risk.\u201d Still, for now, the state isn\u2019t putting indoor winter sports on its list of things not to do.Asked if Gov. Charlie Baker thinks it\u2019s safe for winter sports to proceed, a spokesperson replied that guidelines for Phase III, Step 2 of the state\u2019s reopening still apply \u2014 even though Baker recently announced that the state is rolling back to Phase III, Step 1.Those guidelines describe basketball and hockey as \u201chigher-risk\u201d sports that involve \u201cintermittent close proximity or moderate contact,\u201d and state that practices and games are permissible as long as certain criteria are met, including mandatory masking.Update: The Baker Administration announced Friday that modified Phase III, Step 1 guidelines for youth and adult sports will take effect Monday, when high-school basketball, gymnastics, ice hockey, alpine and Nordic skiing, and swimming and diving are scheduled to begin. They reduce indoor capacity and spectator limits from Phase III, Step 2. ",

She says these language services have even been enlisted by the state's contact tracing program to get necessary info out to residents in their preferred language. Oh added that this commitment to culturally competent care will help Dimock, as well as other community health centers, reach and vaccinate under-served populations in the state.\"I think community health centers as trusted healthcare providers for these communities are going to play a really critical role in raising education, awareness, providing a trusted place where families and patients can come and ask their questions,\" said Oh. \"Community health centers are going to play a really critical role in gaining the trust, I think, of communities of color with regards to this vaccine and accepting this vaccine.\"Click on the audio player above to listen to the full episode.",

      "body": "Imagine a world where you could walk into any corner store, find a COVID-19 rapid test, buy it for just a few dollars, and know within minutes whether you are, or are not, contagious with coronavirus. You wouldn\u2019t need a doctor\u2019s referral to buy one. You wouldn\u2019t need a lab technician to read the result. You wouldn\u2019t even need to endure the deep (and often painful) sinus swab to get the sample.There are places in the world where this scenario is already a reality; the United States is not one of them. That\u2019s not to say that rapid tests don\u2019t exist in the U.S. Back in August, the U.S. government purchased 150 million rapid tests as a way to expand testing, but it hasn\u2019t gotten very far in distributing them. Plus, the ones available for over-the-counter sale still need to be sent to a lab to be processed, many are expensive, and you often need a health provider\u2019s prescription to get access to one.According to Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and immunologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, making rapid testing widely available could be the key to getting back to life as we once knew it \u2014 but seeing the U.S. hesitate over deploying wider rapid testing has been \u201cdispiriting,\u201d he said.A rapid COVID test cassette from LabCentralOther countries, he said, are asking: \u201cWhy, America, can\u2019t you get out of your own way and recognize that you have tools sitting right in front of you? You\u2019re the most resourced country in the world, but you fail to recognize just how powerful the tools sitting in front of you are.\u201dDespite this, it\u2019s possible that we may be seeing rapid tests on the shelves in the near future. A consortium out of LabCentral in Cambridge, Massachusetts is currently developing its own self-administered rapid test. It plans to have the tests available for sale everywhere in the U.S., possibly within weeks. The company has been using the rapid test to get its own employees back to the lab since September, and it has already caught asymptomatic COVID carriers \u2014 stopping outbreaks before they could even happen.\u201cIt\u2019s not the gold standard, but that\u2019s OK,\u201d said Celina Chang, vice president of science operations at LabCentral. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is people with a high enough viral load that they\u2019re actually shedding and infecting other people. And this can definitely detect that.\u201dJohannes Fruehauf, president of LabCental, imagines a future where you show up somewhere \u2014 whether it\u2019s a flight, a work conference, or a wedding \u2014 take a test, get your result, and join the crowd without fear.\u201cWe have all accepted that we will have to wait in line and go through a security screen at the airport so that we are not carrying knives or guns onto the airplane,\u201d Fruehauf said. \u201cAnd we subject [ourselves] to that because we enjoy the sense or the actual safety that this conveys upon every traveler.\u201dAlex Harmon processes tests in a labWhile these tests might get us a few steps closer to traveling or gathering again, they are not flawless. In one widely publicized example, there was a superspreader event at the White House\u2019s Rose Garden in September. After guests tested negative with a rapid test upon arrival, they gathered freely (and closely) without masks. Later, at least 11 attendees \u2014 including President Trump \u2014 tested positive.However, this is where the so-called \u201cswiss cheese\u201d model of protection could come into play. With layers of protections in place, from social distancing to mask-wearing and now even some vaccine administration, the cumulative effect of all of these practices can keep us safe \u2014 and rapid testing could be an important part of that picture, according to Dr. Joshua Schiffer.The infectious disease specialist from the University of Washington is a champion of rapid testing, even if these tests aren\u2019t perfect. In his eyes, we can\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\u201cThere\u2019s a number of different ways to attack this and to achieve success and very few of them are going to involve just a perfect solution that is foolproof,\u201d Schiffer said. \u201cEach of these strategies has holes, but if you apply all of them, fewer infections break through.\u201dSlovakia is one country that has demonstrated how effective rapid testing can be, using the method to stop outbreaks at large scale. Researchers believe Slovakia\u2019s mass testing program, coupled with its strict quarantine measures, may have cut infection rates by as much as 60% in one week, which could turn the tide of the pandemic there. Why aren\u2019t rapid COVID tests being used widely in the United States then, given their success elsewhere?Well, getting these tests into our hands might necessitate a paradigm shift for the U.S. health industry. According to Dr. Mina, allowing individuals to test themselves would be a significant departure from the current system of going to a doctor\u2019s office to get screened, but he believes we shouldn\u2019t let this stop us.\u201cThis is a novel pandemic,\u201d Mina said. \u201cSomebody has to do it first.\u201dSarah Leeson is Associate Producer with Innovation Hub.",

Charlie Baker, who disagreed with the bill's proposal to limit the use of facial recognition technology. She told Boston Public Radio on Friday these are modest proposals.\u201cI\u2019m calling on all state legislators to strike down these amendments, they\u2019re weakening what is already a modest proposal given the depth of the hurt caused by generations of brutality caused by police, unchecked.\u201dBaker sent the bill back to lawmakers yesterday with amendments that strip the bill of restrictions banning all agencies except the Registry of Motor Vehicles from using any software that captures biometric data, including facial recognition software. Pressley said this technology has been proven to be racially biased and has no place in policing as it contributes to the over-surveillance of communities of color.Facial recognition technology \"has already been proven to be biased, racist technology. The whole reason why we have the crisis of police brutality and mass incarceration has everything to do with communities that have historically been under-resourced and over-surveilled and policed,\" accrding to Pressley.Mattapan Rep. Russell Holmes, a member of the Black and Latino Legislative Caucus, told GBH News Thursday he favors compromise. \"I think,\" Holmes said, \"they can work through the concerns that [Baker] has and figure out from what he said what would make sense to us and send him something that I think he wants. Clearly, he wants to sign a bill.\"Pressley also discussed Congress' continued battle over stimulus negotiations. On Thursday, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected a bipartisan relief plan, as Congress remains gridlocked with Democrats pushing for direct cash infusions to Americans and Republicans advocating for corporate liability protections.\"It's just a further demonstration of how callous and disconnected they are from the hardship and devastation,\" she said of the stalemate, noting that projections for Massachusetts put anywhere from 60,000 to 100,000 people at risk of eviction in coming months.\"We're talking about the likes of a tent city,\" she said.Pressley also mentioned the Trump administration's renewal of federal executions, a policy which had been stagnant for 17 years. Trump has continued executions even during the presidential transition, which is unprecedented.\"The legacy of Donald Trump and this administration, and these calloused cowards who have carried his water in this GOP-led senate, is one of death,\" she said. \"In this country we have history of treating trauma with more trauma, and I don't believe state-sanctioned murder is justice.\"Pressley said she would be re-introducing her bill to abolish the death penalty and will be lobbying the Biden-Harris administration to immediately sign an executive order halting executions.",

      "body": "Author Brian Coleman returns with the second volume of Buy Me Boston, a curated collection of local ads and flyers that takes longtime Boston residents back to life between the 1960\u2019s and 1980\u2019s. Coleman spoke to GBH Radio\u2019s Henry Santoro about his archival project. The transcript below has been edited for clarity.Henry Santoro: Some of the many things that make Boston unique have been hiding in plain sight, and they've been hiding for some time. They come in the form of old advertisements, everything from restaurants and hair salons to clothing stores and radio stations. There are flyers for bands that don't exist anymore, who are playing clubs that also don't exist anymore. Well, we can credit pop culture kingpin Brian Coleman for gathering up the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of these local ads and flyers from the 1960\u2019s through the 1980\u2019s and putting them into books that he calls Buy Me Boston. Volume One came out a couple years ago to rave reviews, also by me \u2014 I gave it a rave review too, and now Buy Me Boston Volume Two is out and at just under 300 pages, this is a book that will take you down a rabbit hole you will thoroughly enjoy going down. Brian Coleman, welcome back to GBH and Henry in the Hub. Brian Coleman: Thank you very much. Great to be with you. Henry Santoro: Tell us how this original project came to be. Brian Coleman: I guess I would credit the original one with two different archives, two people. And that would be David Bieber, the renowned saver of all things who has an incredible archive out in Norwood, and Kay Bourne, who was the longtime arts writer for The Bay State Banner. And I had gotten to know both of them better, and started to realize what they had accomplished and what they had done by saving all this. And I think sometimes when you take so much time saving \u2014 which is actually the same thing with a lot of university archives \u2014 you don't do as much sharing because you're so busy gathering. And so I started to see myself as someone who could help with that sharing process. And then I guess I just fumbled into being a what I would call more of a curator than an author. Henry Santoro: What do you think these ads in these flyers and these band placards say about Boston during that time period of the sixties to the eighties? Brian Coleman: I mean, I guess the one thing, and it's not necessarily unique to Boston, but it's just kind of creativity. It's kind of \u2014 especially if we're talking sixties into the mid-seventies \u2014 there were no rules, necessarily, whether that was visually or kind of textually, the way you would kind of present things. That's kind of what I love about it. I mean, I think my favorite ads, if I had to point to one publication in one era, would be the late sixties\u2019 Boston After Dark because they were meant to blend in with the reading of the newspaper itself, meaning you would kind of read everything. You would read the articles and you would read the ads. And the ads were things that you were meant to take time and look at. There were Boston Tea Party ads where you almost have to decipher what the text is. Like, wait, where is the show and what time is it? And so it was kind of challenging readers, I think, to really decipher it. But what it meant is they understood that people would sit down and read these publications versus nowadays, click through, maybe pay attention for about one second if you're lucky, and then go to the next Instagram post.Henry Santoro: Brian Coleman is the curator of the Buy Me Boston books of local ads and flyers from the 1960\u2019s through the eighties.

      "body": "Gov. Charlie Baker signed a $45.9 billion state budget on Friday that will not raise broad-based taxes and reflects a more optimistic view of state finances than once feared early in the pandemic, but the governor sent back with amendments a key section of the legislation that would expand access to abortion.Baker, a pro-choice Republican, said he supports many of the abortion protections prioritized by Democratic leaders after the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court but said he could not support lowering the age of consent to 16.And while he said he would support making abortions available to women after 24 weeks in cases where a doctor has diagnosed a fatal fetal anomaly, he proposed an amendment to tighten the language for when an abortion could be performed to protect the mental health of the mother.Module\"Governor Baker is a strong supporter of women's access to reproductive health care and is proud to have signed into law several provisions protecting these rights previously. That's why he supports many of the important provisions in this budget section that will further protect women's reproductive rights,\" spokeswoman Lizzy Guyton said.The budget, which is more than five months overdue, relies heavily on one-time revenue to balance spending growth of 4.5 percent, including more than $2.76 billion in federal COVID-19 funds and a draw of up to $1.7 billion from the state's \"rainy day\" fund.But the administration also planned to upgrade its revenue projections for the year by $459 million, as some sources of tax revenue, like the sales tax, continue to perform strongly.The Executive Office of Administration and Finance said the combination of strong revenues and money vetoed from the budget make it likely that the state will only need to use about $1.35 billion this fiscal year from its $3.5 billion in reserves.The budget level funds local aid to cities and towns and includes a $108 million increase in Chapter 70 for schools, increases support for substance abuse treatment and boosts spending on rental assistance and food security programs.The budget is still built upon $1.2 billion less in tax revenue than the state collected in fiscal year 2020 and $3.1 billion less than the original fiscal 2021 budget Baker filed in January before the pandemic began, according to the administration.Though the governor often vetoes legislative earmarks, budget officials said Baker signed off on $80 million in earmarks that it saw as one-time needs directed by local legislators to deal with the impacts of COVID-19, but the governor vetoed $156 million in other spending, including $103 million that it saw as an expansion of benefit programs or service provider rates that would carry from year to year.The other $53 million vetoed by Baker was K-12 education funding supported by the Legislature to help schools struggling to educate students during the pandemic. Instead, Baker refiled for the $53 million in a supplemental budget bill that would allow his administration to dole out the money for targeted programs, rather than distribute it through a formula.The supplemental budget he filed Friday also included $49.4 million in small business grants and $5 million to help set up a new Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission, which was part of the policing accountability legislation that he returned to the Legislature Thursday with amendments.The small business grant money proposed by Baker represents about half the business recovery program that Baker filed for in his budget, but which was not included by the Legislature.In total, the governor signed 96 of the 113 outside policy sections passed by the Legislature, including one allowing the registrar of motor vehicle to require anyone granted a hardship license after being caught driving with a blood alcohol content of 0.15 or higher to use an ignition interlock device.Baker also approved of allowing marijuana dispensaries to sell hemp and hemp products grown and manufactured in Massachusetts, and he said yes to repealing a prohibition on crabbing in coastal waters from January 1 through April 30, which the administration said is unnecessary for managing the crab population.The governor proposed an amendment to the section of the budget that would allow for voting by mail through March 31, 2021 in any state or municipal election. While he approved of what the Legislature sent to him, he proposed to add to it by allowing municipalities to offer in-person early voting if they wanted to.The governor also returned a section of the budget related to MBTA service cuts with amendments.",

      "body": "Annie Gordon lives in a two-bedroom apartment several hundred feet from the Fairmount Line commuter rail that used to pass by her Mattapan neighborhood without stopping.The 69-year-old retiree says she was at first thrilled when the city announced plans to create a train stop nearby, streamlining the once onerous commute to downtown Boston. She had signed petitions and attended meetings to encourage the MBTA to build the stop that has now opened across the street.ModuleBut a Waltham-based company, DSF Group, also saw the benefits of the new Blue Hill Avenue MBTA stop and purchased the sprawling 12-building property she has lived in for 44 years.Now Gordon fears she may lose her home, unable to pay what she calls an unreasonably high rent increase of $275 a month.\u201cI think they did it to capitalize on our hard work building the station,\u201d Gordon said at a recent protest outside her home. \u201dNow they want to push us out.\u201dThe company purchased the property in 2018 for $65 million and rebranded, changing the name from Fairlawn Apartments to SoMa at the T. The new name refers to South Mattapan, a neighborhood description most local residents had never heard, with a nod to the New York City hipster neighborhood with a similar name.Company officials did not respond to requests for comment on this story. At the time of the purchase, they touted the transaction as a perfect fit for their strategy of buying \u201cunderutilized properties\u201d near transit stops. Their website details an approach of repositioning properties through \u201caggressive marketing\u201d to \u201cmaximize value.\u201dSoMa resident Annie GordonGordon is among a group of SoMa at the T residents who are fighting rent increases and seeking improvements at the 347-unit property with the help of City Life/Vida Urbana, a Boston based nonprofit that fights for housing equity. They say the DSF Group is among a growing number of property developers raising rents and taking advantage of new train stops that community groups got built through years of grassroots organizing and taxpayer money.\u201cLiterally they've been telling folks the reason why your rates are going up is because of the train station,\u2019\u2019 said Gabrielle Rene, a community organizer with City Life/Vida Urbana. \u201cSo the very work that they did to bring in value to the community is the very thing that's pushing them out.\u201dFor decades, the nine-mile Fairmount Line commuter rail rumbled through areas of Dorchester and Mattapan without stopping. That was until local residents demanded \u2014 and eventually won \u2013 a public investment of $200 million to build four new train stops along the line, including the Talbot Avenue Station in 2012 and the Newmarket and Four Corners/Geneva Avenue stations in 2013.The final stop at Blue Hill Avenue opened last year near Mattapan Square with a ribbon cutting event attended by Gov. Charlie Baker, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh and a group of community organizers. \u201cThe investment this station represents will lead to enhanced access to jobs, housing, and educational opportunities,\u201d said MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak.But with new amenities have come a steady stream of new investors. In addition to SoMa at the T, a California-based company Avanath Capital Management, LLC., recently purchased the nearby Morton Village Apartments, a 207 unit property. After concern from residents, the company signed a five-year contract to keep rents within reach, with the help of $4 million in city money, seen as a model for the best-case scenario by housing advocates.But activists say in many cases residents have been pushed out before anybody could help them. Community activist Allentza Michel says so many people have been forced out along the rail line that some residents question whether they should have ever pushed for the transit improvements in the first place.\u201cThere are community members who have told me directly to my face, \u2018If we're going to be pushed out, then we don't want this train. This train is not for us. It's for the white people who want to move back from the suburbs into the city who left in the first place when we moved here,\u2019\u201d Michel said.Community activists were concerned about gentrification along the line from the start. They\u2019d seen the pattern of displacement before. A 2011 study of the 1980s extension of the Red Line to north Cambridge found transit improvements accelerated gentrification with lower income residents moving out quicker and wealthier residents moving in faster than the city as a whole.Co-author Brian Feinstein, now a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, says he was surprised to see a dramatic drop in people receiving public assistance along the expanded rail line. \u201cThis really is a replacement story, really textbook gentrification where lower income residents are being priced out of their homes in areas where you see expanded amenities, in this case, transit,\u201d he said. Betty Lewis speaks at an eviction protest on the Boston Common Marvin Martin, executive director of the Dorchester nonprofit Action for Equity, says he doesn\u2019t regret pushing for new infrastructure in a long-neglected community. He believes there have been successful government and community efforts to protect affordability in the area with more initiatives on the way. The situation at SoMa, he said, was one of the worst outcomes.\u201cWe should not deny ourselves the same comforts and opportunities that other communities have out of fear of gentrification,\u2019\u2019 Martin said.City housing officials have been working to create new affordable housing along the Fairmount corridor, including a new 76-unit property at the former Cote Ford dealership site adjacent to the Blue Hill stop.Sheila Dillon, the city\u2019s housing chief, says an important strategy is to preserve affordability in occupied buildings. City officials had tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to steer the sale of the former Fairlawn Apartments to a national nonprofit, the Boston-based Preservation of Affordable Housing. The group offered a similar price for the property, she said, but lost its bid anyway.After the sale to DSF, Dillon says, the city tried to work with new owners, without luck. \u201cThe current owners have made it clear that they don't want to negotiate with the city or the residents on keeping rents at a level where tenants can afford them,\u2019\u2019 she said.The SoMa situation has become a poster child among some housing advocates for legislation \u2014 called the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act \u2014 that would help tenants steer owners to sell their properties to nonprofits at market rates.Joe Kriesberg, president of the Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations, says if the law had been in place, it could have helped Fairmount residents steer the sale to a nonprofit that would have focused on building improvements and long-term affordability.\u201cYou could have both. You could have an improvement in the quality of the neighborhood, in the housing stock and people could stay,\u2019\u2019 Kriesberg said.The legislation is currently stalled in the state house. Some property owners oppose the proposed law, saying it could delay sales of occupied buildings for months and reduce the tax base.Whether or not the legislation is passed, it\u2019s too late for residents at SoMa at the T to change who now owns the development that abuts the rail line, where the sound of passing trains is a frequent hum.SoMaGBHphotos-13.jpgGordon says that as her rent has increased over time, conditions have deteriorated at the development of four-story buildings surrounding a corridor of trees and walking paths.Years ago, past owners pulled out a swimming pool and a playground, eliminated a security guard at the entrance and shut down elevators in her building, replacing them with fee-for-use storage. Walking up the four flights of stairs to her apartment is particularly challenging, she says, because she suffers from Lupus-related conditions and a weak knee. Gordon says new owners sought to raise her $1,810 monthly rent by about $275, a hike she says will break her family\u2019s monthly budget of just over $2,500. She\u2019s worried about what happens if her landlords don\u2019t back down \u2014 so much so she recently reached out to a homeless shelter.\u201cIf things don't work out here, having to go into a shelter, that really creates a lot of anxiety,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cBeing an older person, and never having had to do that in my life.\u201dBetty Lewis, 69, also is worrying about what will happen to her if landlords don\u2019t negotiate. She says owners attempted to raise her $1,800 a month rent by $300, adding another $500 penalty because she refused to sign the lease. She\u2019s lived in her apartment for almost 40 years and despite issues with mold and rodents, she doesn\u2019t want to leave. She says she\u2019s going to fight to stay, grateful she\u2019s learned about her rights with the help of City Life. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s being unreasonable. She just wants to be treated fairly.\u201cI don't want to be out on the street,\u201d she said. \u201cI want a stable rent.\u201dThere is some hope for better news for current residents. Following growing rancor among tenants, the DSF group this fall hired a new property management company, WinnCompanies. Company official Trevor Samios told GBH News that he wants to work with residents \u2014 and recently held a meeting at the property to hear their demands.\u201cWe were brought in to help, provide better management, broker better relationships between ownership and residents and the city of Boston,\u201d said Samios, vice president of Connected Communities at WinnCompanies. \u201cOur goal is that certainly some of those items are going to be met.\u201dThis new tone comes as the pandemic has depressed rents around Boston, still one of the most expensive cities in the country to live in. The MBTA also on Thursday announced cuts to commuter line service because of dropping ridership and reduced employee availability.Even if long-term renters at SoMa at the T are able to negotiate reasonable rent hikes over time, it is unlikely that residents along the Fairmount corridor will be able to significantly slow the gentrification that is coming into their neighborhoods as steadily as a moving train.

      "body": "Massachusetts hospitals are filling up again, like those across the country. Many of the patients are Black and Latino Americans, the groups that have been most disproportionately affected by the pandemic. The good news is that a COVID-19 vaccine is just weeks away from the first phase of distribution. The troubling question is, will Black and Latino Americans show up to take it?\"I am not feeling this vaccine, and I'm certainly not feeling like being in the guinea pig phase,\" the Rev. Emmett Price told me on our WGBH News podcast, All Rev'd Up. Like many Black ministers across the country, he is not comfortable telling his congregation to be first in line for the vaccine.Price is not alone. His reservations about the vaccine come from a history of experimenting on Black bodies that has resulted in trauma that spans generations and continued health disparities that resonate to this day.The Rev. Liz Walker, the senior pastor of Roxbury Presbyterian Church and a former WBZ anchor, recognized the high level of hesitancy many of her Black parishioners, and the community at large, had to get vaccinated. She invited the country's most trusted voice on the issue \u2014 Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.Walker conducted a webinar in November where Fauci spoke to the Roxbury community. He recognized our distrust in the medical system but assured the audience that the speed with which the vaccine was developed does not compromise its safety or its scientific integrity. Fauci did express concern about the lack of diversity in the clinical trials for the vaccine and say that he wished more minorities were in them.\"What's safe and effected should not be only for whites,\" Fauci said.Most African Americans, young or old, cannot shake off the Tuskegee Experiment, a clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 to observe the effects of untreated syphilis on African American men under the guise that they were receiving free health care. It resulted in a lifelong hell of mental and health complications for these men, their families and their offspring.Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman from Virginia whose cancer cells were the source for the first immortalized human cell line in medical research. Her cells were essential in developing the polio vaccine and researching leukemia, AIDS and various cancers. They were taken without her consent in the 1950s, and the Lacks family is still suing Johns Hopkins for compensation.1n 2018, a statue of J. Marion Sims, called the \"father of gynecology,\" erected in 1890, was finally removed from New York's Central Park. The statue stood across from the New York Academy of Medicine. Sims perfected his revolutionary surgeries on enslaved black women without the use of anesthesia. He started using anesthesia once he began to treat white women at his clinic in New York City.Black people are not largely anti-vaxxers, but the high levels of hesitancy around the COVID-19 vaccine are understandable. To assist in shoring up confidence throughout the country, former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have volunteered to get their vaccines on camera.I am asked constantly whether I will get the COVID-19 vaccine. I don't know yet. My spouse is an ER physician and will get vaccinated before me. She is my canary in the coal mine.",

      "body": "State public health officials have begun providing the public with more detailed information on hospital bed availability as the health care system deals with a growing number of COVID-19 patients and shortages of people to care for them.The Department of Public Health this weekend began using hospital bed counts as reported by the hospitals rather than rounded figures when reporting hospital capacity data in its daily reports. For instance, Friday's report said there were 9,400 total non-intensive care unit beds in Massachusetts and Saturday's new, more detailed report put the number at 9,365 total beds.The switch happened on a weekend that saw DPH confirm 9,645 new cases of the coronavirus, 4,968 on Saturday and another 4,677 cases Sunday. The agency also announced a total of 88 recent COVID-19 deaths this weekend. Over the last week, Massachusetts has confirmed 29,552 new cases of the coronavirus. In all, 279,574 people here have been infected with the virus and 11,349 people have died with confirmed or likely cases of COVID-19.As of 3 p.m. Saturday, there were 1,707 people with COVID-19 hospitalized in Massachusetts, an increase of 102 patients over the previous 48 hours. There were about 1,490 non-ICU beds open and able to be staffed within 24 hours, representing roughly 16 percent capacity, DPH said. There were also about 395 ICU beds that could accept patients within 24 hours, about 27 percent of available capacity.DPH said Sunday that the state's seven-day average positive test rate fell to 5.61 percent from 5.72 percent Friday, though it remains far higher than the 0.8 percent positive test rate the state averaged as recently as late September.",

      "body": "As the first COVID-19 vaccines began arriving in Massachusetts on Monday, a 96-year-old World War II veteran in Bedford became the first VA patient in the country to get the shot.The VA Bedford Healthcare system announced the milestone over social media, posting that Margaret Klessens, a resident of the Community Living Center in the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital received the shot at 12:07 p.m.Andrew Miller, a housekeeper in environmental management service, was the first VA Bedford employee to get the vaccine, at 12:20 p.m.The recipients of the Bedford VA's first doses are among the initial tier of Americans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine outside of manufacturers' trials in the early rounds of a distribution campaign that is set to strech for months.The Bedford system is one of 37 VA sites the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs tapped to receive its first doses of COVID-19 vaccines for front-line health care workers and long-term care residents.Massachusetts ordered its initial round of 59,475 doses of Pfizer vaccines -- which received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration on Friday -- from the federal government on Dec. 4. Those doses, according to Gov. Charlie Baker's office, will be delivered to 21 hospitals and the Department of Public Health immunization lab, then redistributed to 74 hospitals across the state for front-line medical workers.The next 40,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines \"will be allocated to the Federal Pharmacy Program to begin vaccinating staff and residents of skilled nursing facilities, rest homes and assisted living residences,\" Baker's office said on Dec. 9.Boston Medical Center received 1,950 doses Monday morning of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a spokesman confirmed.\"Beginning Wednesday, we will begin the first wave of vaccinations to front line health care workers, a group including doctors and nurses from our ICU and Emergency Department and patient floors that treat COVID-19 patients, but just as importantly, employees from environmental and support services, and other crucial positions that work in COVID-positive patient areas,\" the hospital said.Massachusetts officials expect to receive 300,000 first doses of the two-shot vaccine by the end of the month.The Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association on Monday trumpeted the Friday vote by the Food & Drug Administration to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, writing in its newsletter that health care workers and long-term care facility residents \"can expect to get vaccinated as early as this week.\"\"The fact that this vaccine, and another from Moderna that is expected to be approved shortly, went from conception to large-scale distribution within a year is unparalleled in the history of vaccinations,\" the MHA wrote in its Monday Report.The MHA said one concern of its vaccine workgroup, who has about 80 members from nearly all hospitals across the state, is that the two-dose vaccine, delivered about three weeks apart, \"has been reported to cause some recipients discomfort for a day or more after the initial dose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a similar reaction to other viral vaccines.\"Hospitals plan to stagger vaccine delivery to avoid gaps in their workforce if employees take a sick day, the MHA said.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told Martha Raddatz of ABC News Sunday that he would be on hand Tuesday when the first vaccine shots in his state will be given at University Hospital in Newark.\"We will begin vaccinating our heroic health care workers,\" Murphy said. \"It's gonna be a big day on Tuesday morning in Newark.\"",

      "body": "Massachusetts received its first vaccine to protect against COVID-19 when the shipment was delivered Monday morning at Boston Medical Center.David Twitchell, the hospital's chief pharmacy officer, said the shipment of 1,950 vials of Pfizer vaccine has been unpacked and put in a freezer that maintains ultra-cold temperatures. The hospital will begin administering doses on Wednesday. The first will go to doctors, nurses and front-line staff.\u201cThe first vaccinations will be at 9 a.m. Wednesday and so away we go, \" Twitchell said. \"We'll vaccinate about 1,000 by Saturday or so--that would be optimistic--and 2,000 toward the end of next week.\u201dA total of 60,000 doses of the vaccine in various shipments arrived in the state Monday, with another 120,000 expected next week, according to Twitchell.While the Pfizer vaccine requires two shots to be fully effective, he said the hospital will administer all doses on hand and wait for another shipment before giving anyone the second shot. Tufts Medical Center and the Mass General Brigham hospitals are expecting their first vaccine shipments Tuesday.Below are five things to know about the delivery of the Pfizer vaccine to Massachusetts, according to Twitchell, who said health officials will be conducting a mass outreach campaign.1. Who is the first group of people to receive the vaccine?Clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers doing direct and COVID-facing care are the first to be vaccinated. Long-term care and assisted living facilities and police, fire and emergency medical technicians are also in phase one of the state guidelines. 2. When can the public expect to sign up to receive the vaccine?Hospitals and other medical facilities such as long-term care facilities will follow state guidelines for vaccinating the public as new shipments arrive. Once the supply chain expands, distribution of the vaccine and available dates will become clearer, but it looks to be around February. Pfizer and Moderna are both a two-dose vaccine. That's not uncommon; many diseases require this. The first dose initiates the body\u2019s immune system. When the second dose is given, the body is prepared and the effect is stronger.3. Can a person \u201ccatch\u201d COVID-19 after getting the vaccine and is there any cost to be vaccinated?After getting vaccinated a person cannot get COVID from the vaccine and will be at least protected against severe symptoms of the disease, if not altogether. Mask wearing, socially distancing and limiting travel, is still advised until a larger percentage of the population receives the vaccine. There is no cost to any patient. A patient cannot be made to pay any dollar amount.4. Should a person be vaccinated if they have an allergy or autoimmune disease and how safe is a vaccine?Anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction that requires medical attention is excluded from obtaining a vaccine, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. In the future, people who are on the border of having allergies need to inform their provider so they can take extra precautions. The vaccine trials conducted separately by Pfizer and Cambridge-based Moderna excluded people with a history of severe allergies. Of the 70,000 people participating in the trials in the U.S., each receiving two doses for a total of 140,000 shots, no one had an allergic reaction, so screening is important.There is nothing that says a person with an autoimmune disease cannot be vaccinated, but talk to your provider.These vaccines passed the same rigorous testing standards any drug would have to in order to be approved. Given this was a pandemic and federal support funded the acceleration, speed was possible. Also keep in mind there are no less than 9 systems designed to monitor the safety of this vaccine (and other vaccines). Officials continue to learn and use that to keep people safe.5. If you are pregnant or lactating, is it safe to get the vaccine?The CDC reviewed the guidelines and says no data or not enough data exist to know if it's safe in those situations, but it's suggested a patient get the vaccine because the benefits outweigh the risks. There is no reason to believe that the vaccine is harmful to breastfeeding infants, according to the CDC. Talk to a provider as you weigh these decisions.",

      "body": "Executive branch agencies in Gov. Charlie Baker\u2019s administration boosted their spending with minority-owned businesses by nearly $20 million in fiscal year 2020, pushing minority contracts to account for more than 6% of the state\u2019s discretionary spending for the first time since 2015, according to data obtained by GBH News.Overall, Baker's cabinet agencies \u2014 such as the Executive Office of Education and the Executive Office of Health and Human Services \u2014 reported spending just under $300 million with minority-owned vendors out of a total $4.8 billion in discretionary spending, or about 6.25% of their budgets. Those totals do not include quasi-government agencies like MassPort, MassHousing and the Convention Center Authority.Baker had set an 8% target for state agency spending with minority-owned businesses. But, as the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting revealed in September, that target includes tens of millions that state contractors spent with minority-owned businesses that may have nothing at all to do with state contracts. After the GBH report, Baker announced that in future annual reports, the state will no longer combine direct state spending totals with third-party payments to minority firms. According to an agency-by-agency report on minority contract spending through September \u2014 the end of the 2020 fiscal year \u2014 obtained by GBH News, most state agencies maintained or slightly increased their rate of minority spending from the prior year. But the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development posted a huge jump in 2020. In 2019, the agency spent about $2.2 million of its $12.4 million budget with minority vendors. In 2020, it more than tripled minority spending, to $6.8 million, while its overall budget stayed about the same. More than half of its spending went to minority-owned businesses.A big part of that jump was $3.5 million the agency spent with Nava PBC, a Washington, D.C.-based minority-owned software firm that was not a vendor in 2019. Nava\u2019s website says it was hired to help set up for the new paid family and medical leave program that will take effect in Massachusetts on Jan. 1. The department also boosted its payments to ThinkArgus, a Boston-based minority-owned communications firm, from about $300,000 in 2019 to $1.5 million in 2020, also for work on rolling out the new family and medical leave program.The state\u2019s ability to increase agency spending with minority-owned businesses in 2020 is particularly notable given that national business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have reported that the COVID-induced economic slowdown has hit minority-owned firms harder than non-minority businesses. \u201cThe Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development\u2019s increased spending with minority-business enterprises highlights the Baker-Polito administration ongoing efforts to strengthen and improve supplier diversity spending and ensure the commonwealth supports and benefits from its diverse business community,\u201d said Patrick Marvin, communications director for the state\u2019s Executive Office for Administration and Finance. \u201cSince taking office in 2015, the administration has focused on expanding opportunities for diverse businesses across Massachusetts and recently announced a series of comprehensive measures to ensure equal opportunity and increase access for diverse companies in state contracting,\u201d Marvin said.The governor's announced measures have been partly in response to a series of GBH News reports indicating that the value of government contracts flowing to minority-owned business \u2014 and Black-owned businesses in particular \u2014 has declined over the past two decades. In fiscal year 1998, the state reported spending over $350 million with minority vendors for goods and services, design and construction. That total included other agencies beyond the executive branch, so it is not directly comparable to the 2020 total the state has thus far reported.Between 2007 and 2016, Massachusetts also counted Portuguese-owned businesses as \u201cminority-owned,\u201d which inflated the totals for several years until a court reversed that policy. The court order has reduced by tens of millions of dollars the amount of money Massachusetts agencies can claim they spent with minority-owned businesses.",

      "body": "As the first vaccines against COVID-19 are being distributed, there\u2019s been a lot of conversation about who will be at the front of the line for the shot. But there is one group that\u2019s not eligible: Kids. Here\u2019s a look at why this is, when it will change and what the implications are for reopening. The first COVID vaccine has been approved. Can kids get it?Right now, the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine has only been approved for individuals 16 years and older. Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics put out a call for vaccine trials to start including kids. Now, those trials are getting started, but only for older children, ages 12 and above. \u201cWe know children aren't little adults, and so we need to know how they're going to respond and react to this vaccine,\u201d said Sally Goza, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. She wants a vaccine for kids to be available by next school year and, she said, that means trials would need to start soon. More than 1 million kids have already been infected with the virus. \u201cAnd we also know that children suffer in other ways from this virus, from the social isolation, from not being able to go to school, food insecurity, housing insecurity, all of those things are affecting our children,\u201d Goza said.Despite calls to move quickly to begin testing the vaccine on children, it\u2019s standard practice that when a new vaccine is ready for testing in humans it is first tried in healthy young adults. If something goes wrong, their bodies are the best equipped to respond. After the COVID vaccine was proven to be safe and effective in healthy young adults, the elderly were next in line. \u201cBecause of the urgency of the pandemic, we immediately went to the highest risk population, which is, of course, the older adult,\u201d said Rick Malley, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and a doctor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.After the highest-risk populations are addressed, \u201cgradually the vaccines are studied in lower and lower and lower age groups,\u201d he said.Why are vaccines tested separately in kids and adults?\u201cThe reality is that the immune system is not a static system. It is evolving as the individual ages,\u201d said Malley. \u201cIt's very different when you are a newborn compared to a young infant, compared to a toddler and so on and so forth.\u201d He says studying each age group is key to learning about different side effects and the correct dosage. Plus you really need to make sure the vaccine is not going to cause more problems than the virus causes, and that varies by age. \u201cBecause children are at such lower risk of severe complications from COVID-19, the bar of acceptability of serious adverse events from the vaccine has also got to be higher,\u201d Malley said.When will a COVID vaccine for kids be available?Nobody knows exactly. Malley expects vaccine trials in kids to be rolled out over the next year, sequentially getting to younger and younger age groups.Lloyd Fisher, head of the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and a local pediatrician, said once the shot is approved, he is not too worried about vaccine distribution. \u201cThe great thing about Massachusetts is we have a very strong immunization program. Our state already supplies all of the vaccinations for everyone under 19 years,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWe have a very good distribution network of vaccines coming from the State Department of Public Health to our pediatric and family medicine practices where children receive care.\u201dBy that time, he added, we should have worked out a good system for keeping the vaccines cold.What are the implications for reopening schools?Experts are hopeful that not having a COVID vaccine approved for kids will not significantly delay getting kids back into classrooms. \u201cIn general, we believe that schools have not represented a major source of super-spreading events or onward transmission,\u201d said Malley. Plus, he said, as more and more adults get vaccinated the amount of the virus in a community will hopefully get to a very low level.Combine those two facts and, he said, there hopefully won\u2019t be much concern about kids going to school even if they are unvaccinated.When kids do get the vaccine, can they go back to playing like they did before the pandemic?No, not yet. Once children start getting the vaccine, we know it will make that individual kid a lot less likely to get sick, but we still won\u2019t know how long that protection will last or whether the vaccinated kid will be able to transmit the virus to someone else, even if they don\u2019t get sick from it. So, kids \u2014 like adults \u2014 will still need to keep wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding crowded spaces. A vaccine for kids will make things a whole lot better, but it doesn\u2019t mean things will return to pre-pandemic normal, at least not yet. ",

      "body": "Despite strong pushback, the MBTA is barreling ahead with significant service reductions early next year, cutting the frequency of subway and bus trips, some commuter rail weekend service, ferry schedules and more in an attempt to reduce costs amid a pandemic-fueled budget crunch.With a 3-2 vote that capped off months of planning, public outcry and debate, the T's Fiscal and Management Control Board approved virtually all of the changes that MBTA staff had proposed, resurfacing long-simmering frustrations over the transit agency's funding and leaving unclear when or how services will be restored.The board made a handful of changes aimed at keeping some commuter rail service after 9 p.m., setting a target date for determining if the agency needs to increase service, and ensuring that fare hikes \u2014 which had not been recently proposed \u2014 will not factor into the agency's upcoming budget deliberations.Cuts set to hit in January and March are scaled back from an earlier proposal and aimed only at the second half of fiscal year 2021. MBTA officials plan to decide in the spring whether to keep them in place, restore some service, or implement additional cuts in FY22, which begins July 1.The outlook for T usage and revenues remains hazy, with the potential for a new round of federal funding, vaccination timelines, and changes in commuting behaviors complicating the T's calculations.\"Part of the reason why we have somewhat bifurcated the decision-making in this process is we want to see what we learn over the next few months,\" MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak told reporters ahead of Monday's meeting. \"We want to let all of those items -- I don't know that they're going to resolve themselves definitively, but we will have a lot more information in February and March than we do right now.\"The T also got a boost last week when Gov. Charlie Baker signed a fiscal year 2021 statewide budget and his administration upgraded its tax revenue projections. Under the latest figures, the T could receive another $52 million in sales tax revenue this spending year -- more than half as much as the net savings under the original service cut plan -- that it did not anticipate.FMCB members Joseph Aiello, Monica Tibbits-Nutt and Brian Lang supported the board vote, while members Chrystal Kornegay and Tim Sullivan voted against it.Kornegay and Sullivan voted against a Lang amendment, which passed by the same 3-2 margin, requiring the FMCB and its successor board to avoid increasing fares on buses and subways before both ridership and service hours return to fall 2019 levels.All five board members were appointed by Baker, whose administration oversees the MBTA and who has slammed the idea of running trains and buses on pre-COVID schedules for a fraction of the riders as \"bad public policy.\"The vote drew vocal condemnation from many of the interests that have spent the past several months urging board members to rule out service cuts.Many elected officials, transportation activists and community leaders argued that reducing service to cope with a budget gap is a short-sighted strategy that will strand riders, particularly in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color, amid a public health crisis.Jen Benson, a former state representative and president of the Alliance for Business Leadership, said Monday evening that the cuts \"will set us back in our efforts to make our transit systems more accessible and equitable.\"\"Despite assurances from MBTA leadership, these cuts will be difficult to reverse and will alter the commutes of thousands of people, pushing more of them away from public transit and into cars,\" Benson said in a statement. \"Many commuters, including essential workers, will be stranded without late-night and weekend commuter rail service, and more riders will be crowded onto fewer subway cars. With today's news that the first COVID-19 vaccines are being administered in the U.S., we should be preparing for the recovery to begin, not surrendering our public services to the pandemic.\"The vote also came as Boston Mayor Martin Walsh, citing the recent rise in COVID-19 cases, ordered gyms, movie theaters, museums and other indoor event spaces in Boston to close for general in-person use, starting on Wednesday. Walsh said leaders in nearby communities are also planning to announce new COVID-19 restrictions.Under the plan, unveiled and approved Monday, the T will halt weekend commuter rail service on all but five lines starting in January, as well as reduce Hingham and Hull ferry service and cut all Charlestown and Hingham direct ferry service to Boston.Weekend service will remain available, but less frequent, on the Worcester, Providence, Newburyport/Rockport, Middleboro and Fairmount Lines, which officials say together represent about two-thirds of the commuter rail's COVID-era weekend ridership.Other major changes will hit in March: 20 bus routes will be eliminated; frequency will drop 20 percent on non-essential bus routes and 5 percent on essential bus routes; gaps between Red, Orange and Green Line trains will increase 20 percent; Blue Line trains will run up to 5 percent less frequently; and more commuter rail cuts will arrive, including possible reductions in service after 9 p.m.Board members added three amendments to the package before approving it. One, suggested by Aiello, changed the original language eliminating weekday commuter rail service after 9 p.m. to a less severe -- and more vague -- adjustment of schedules \"to optimize span of service.\"Another, offered by Tibbits-Nutt and approved unanimously, requires the FMCB to determine by March 15, 2021 if it needs to expand service in the final months of fiscal 2021 to respond to growing demand.The third and final amendment bars the board or whatever entity succeeds it when its authority expires next year from increasing bus and rapid transit fares before service hours and ridership numbers return to pre-pandemic levels.MBTA leaders had not planned on proposing fare increases as part of the FY22 budget process, but the amendment from Lang more forcefully blocks that route. Kornegay and Sullivan voted against it, voicing concerns with the dynamic of setting orders for the body that follows the FMCB.Lang, who serves as president of the UNITE Here Local 26 hotel and food service union, said he agreed with much of the public feedback that the T should avoid cuts and reduce or even eliminate fares.He took aim at the Legislature, remarking that he was \"somewhat amused\" to hear opposition to proposed cuts from state lawmakers even though the FMCB itself is \"not a funding source.\"\"I'm amused because, I think to myself, well, if that's really your opinion, why are you telling us?\" Lang said. \"Why aren't you organizing your colleagues up at Beacon Hill to do something about this and come up with a sustainable fiscal plan so we don't have to make cuts, so we don't have to raise fares?\"Legislative leaders have made little progress in the past nine months on directing additional long-term funding to the MBTA. The House continues to back a package of transportation-related tax and fee increases, approved in March, that the Senate never took up.Responding to Lang's concerns later in the meeting, Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack said the T typically receives $2 in tax revenue for every $1 it gets from fares.The cuts are substantial, though MBTA officials scaled back the final package from an earlier proposal to focus on reducing service in several areas rather than outright eliminating it.That draft called for eliminating bus and subway service after midnight, cutting the Hingham and Hull ferries entirely, and replacing the final five subway stops on the Green Line's E Branch with shuttle buses, none of which made it into the board-approved plan.It also proposed ending all weekend commuter rail service, rather than cutting it on seven out of 12 lines as the final plan does.Layoffs are still on the table, but Poftak did not offer any specific estimates on workforce impacts, saying officials are in \"productive discussions\" with labor leaders.At the moment, MBTA officials are not sure how much money the agency will save under the updated plan and expect to have an estimate in late January or early February.Poftak clarified during the briefing, though, that he expects the spending reduction to be less than the original plan proposed in November, which would have carried a net savings -- once accounting for the decline in ridership caused by less service -- of up to $95 million.Like transit agencies around the country, the MBTA faces a major shortfall because fare revenue has evaporated during the pandemic. Previous estimates forecast a deficit of more than $580 million in fiscal year 2022.Service cuts are just one component of a larger plan to grapple with that shortfall, alongside reallocating federal funding and trimming capital spending.\"I do not see what the T is proposing as anywhere close to a doomsday scenario,\" Pollack said. \"This is a service adjustment, which is providing more than adequate service for the number of riders we have and expect to have for the remainder of the current fiscal year.\"The MBTA Advisory Board, an independent organization representing the interests of cities and towns in the T's coverage area, said it was happy to see the agency partially embrace service reductions over eliminations in its final plan.Advisory Board Executive Director Brian Kane warned that the current COVID budget crisis is another \"symptom of the MBTA's structural deficit,\" also turning a spotlight toward Beacon Hill.\"Over the last 20 years fixes such as studies, panels, commissions, committees, governance tweaks, merging agencies, financial engineering, and many other short-term remedies have been tried to solve the symptoms of this structural deficit,\" Kane said in a statement. \"Just as with COVID-19, treating symptoms alone does not save the patient. To stop the revolving door of regular MBTA budget crises that we all find ourselves in, the MBTA's broken financial structure must be treated and cured - without doing this, nothing has been accomplished.\"",

      "body": "While state higher education leaders juggle response to a variety of long-term enrollment and equity questions, they now also appear to be staring down what one expert called \"the college-going gap of 2021.\"The rate of high school students preparing higher education financial aid applications dropped nationwide this fall amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and in Massachusetts, the declines are even more pronounced in districts with larger low-income populations or communities of color.Those student groups already face disproportionate challenges, and the difference in financial aid applications has raised concerns among state officials that the public health crisis could widen existing gaps in access to the resources necessary to attend college or university.\"We're not going to change the direction of this without an extraordinary effort,\" said Chris Gabrieli, chair of the state's Board of Higher Education, during a Tuesday presentation on the trend. \"Business as usual, as impeded as it is by the year's circumstances, seems likely to me -- not certain, it's all guesswork -- to lead to a lot of missed opportunities.\"Education officials identified the potentially worrisome trend by analyzing rates of completion for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which is a key indicator of whether high school seniors intend to pursue college the following fall.Through Thanksgiving, the FAFSA completion rate was about 16 percent lower nationwide and 18 percent lower in Massachusetts than during the same span in 2019, according to data presented at Tuesday's board meeting by Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Chief Strategy and Research Officer Matt Deninger.The change is more pronounced among more vulnerable populations: for the 50 Massachusetts high schools with the largest populations of minority and low-income students, FAFSA completion rates were down about 25 percent -- more than a third higher than the statewide figure -- from last year through Thanksgiving.\"This is not an indictment of staff or our schools not doing their jobs,\" Deninger said. \"Rather, we believe this is a clear reflection of just an extremely challenging and disruptive year and huge levels of uncertainty as to what the future holds.\"The COVID-19 pandemic has upended education across the country, shifting students abruptly to remote learning in the spring and then placing them in an array of different in-person, hybrid or virtual models this fall.In addition to the major education and economic stressors many families are facing during the upheaval, officials said remote learning in particular could be a key factor behind the disparate decline in FAFSA rates.Many of the largest urban school districts in Massachusetts remain in models where most students are learning from home every day, where they have less access to guidance counselors and other support staff that play a key role in determining post-high school plans.\"My colleagues that are fully remote just say it is so hard to even have the students engage in their academics, so I can only imagine with a guidance counselor trying to reach out and promote FAFSA being completed just must be an enormous task,\" said Sheila Harrity, the Board of Higher Education's vice chair and Superintendent-Director at the Montachusett Regional Vocational Technical School District.Behind the trend, Deninger said, the difference in FAFSA completion rates by individual school varies significantly.Most of the schools on the list of 50 with the largest nonwhite and low-income populations saw completion rates drop in the sample timeframe, six by more than 60 percent. Several others, though, saw their rates increase.Deninger also stressed that the trend could still change over the next few months. High school seniors can fill out the FAFSA \"well into the spring,\" he said, so the gap could grow or shrink.State education officials plan to work with school counselors over the next few months, aiming to connect with both the statewide association of counselors and with individual departments in districts where the impacts are most significant.Gabrieli noted that the drop in financial aid applications could create significant ripple effects, potentially exacerbating challenges that many community colleges and state universities face to enroll enough students to make ends meet.\"Today's FAFSA problem is tomorrow's enrollment problem, and more importantly, is our moral problem,\" he said.",

James McGovern, Sen. Edward Markey and Rep. Ayanna Pressley in a statement. \u201cTo ensure their needs are being met and that the program is effective, USDA must engage in effective oversight.\u201dThe Farmers to Families Food Box Program began last spring under federal coronavirus relief legislation that directed the USDA to purchase and distribute agricultural products meant for schools, food banks and families experiencing hunger.The Greater Boston Food Bank said today that the box program has been cumbersome to navigate because the vendors and terms have changed four times since it started. But spokeswoman Catherine Drennan said the food supply filled a gap for both the food bank and partner organizations.A reduction in spending by the U.S. Department of Agriculture has severely cut back on badly needed food deliveries to local hunger relief organizations, members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation said Tuesday.\u201cThe carpet was kind of pulled out from under a lot of organizations because they were relying on this program,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of organizations outside of the Greater Boston Food Bank Network are no longer now receiving (the) product, so that's the big issue. There is all of the sudden a huge gap within the food network.\u201dThe USDA told GBH News that funding for this latest round of food assistance is about half what the agency spent in previous cycles of the since coronavirus relief legislation created the Farmers to Families Food Box Program.The state\u2019s congressional delegation said it is trying to get answers from the USDA while some food pantries are now scrambling to make up for the shortfall.Meanwhile, the Food for Free Committee is seeking more cash donations so it can buy food while also teaming up with an organization that gleans unused food from farms, food service companies and grocers.This story has been updated to include a response from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",

The associate hospital epidemiologist, who regularly sees COVID-19 patients, didn\u2019t flinch at all as she was injected with the Pfizer vaccine Tuesday afternoon.\u201cIt's definitely a relief,\u201d she said, adding that her concern wasn\u2019t about infection within the hospital. \u201cBecause I firmly believe that PPE works and that it protects our health care workers. But more so to protect everyone outside the hospital, like my nieces, my nephews. And [I'm] doing this for the community. Not only for us, but for everyone else.\u201d Andujar Vazquez said she did consider carefully whether to get the vaccine.Module\u201cI looked at the data and I talked to many experts in vaccinology and epidemiology,\u201d she said. \u201cI made an informed decision that vaccinating is the way to go.\u201d Gov. Charlie Baker said Tuesday that four hospitals in the state have gotten 6,000 first doses of the two-stage Pfizer vaccine, and the federal government was expected to ship out more than 53,000 additional doses to 17 more Massachusetts hospitals on Tuesday.\u201cIt is very bittersweet today because we have hit that milestone of 300,000 deaths, and we know that we still have our long winter ahead of the surge and hospitalizations and death and suffering,\" Dr. Shira Doron, hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center said Tuesday, shortly after receiving the vaccine herself. \u201cBut at the same time, it's a good day to have hope. It's a good day to have the first vaccines going out in Massachusetts and to be confident, finally, that there's some light at the end of this dark, dark and long tunnel.\u201d Doron said the speed at which the vaccine was developed shouldn\u2019t undermine trust that it\u2019s safe.\u201cAlthough we made history here \u2014 the U.S., the world made history in getting a vaccine out in less than one year \u2014 that was a feat of efficiency,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn't represent cutting corners on safety.\u201d While the Pfizer vaccine is just beginning to be rolled out, a new vaccine by Cambridge-based Moderna is expected to be right on its heels. The FDA said Tuesday that new data shows the Moderna vaccine is safe and effective. A panel of outside experts is expected to vote to recommend the formula on Thursday, with the FDA's green light coming soon thereafter.Dr. Helen Boucher, chief of Infectious Diseases at Tufts Medical Center, also received the vaccine on Tuesday. There\u2019s a push, she said, to get healthcare workers vaccinated as soon as possible.\u201cAnd next, it'll be our long-term care residents, and on and on and on, until we can get to that 70 percent immunity that we need, so we'll be able to go back to life,\u201d she said.But Dr. Boucher emphasized that there\u2019s still a long way to go until that happens, so it\u2019s crucial that people remain cautious about spreading the virus.\u201cSo we have to, mask up, keep our distance, avoid crowds, wash our hands and not travel,\u201d Dr. Boucher said. \u201cAnd it's really, really hard because everyone's tired and everyone wants to be together for the holidays,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the plea I have is to remember this is one holiday. We will be together again next year for the holidays. And so please make those hard decisions to keep yourself and your family safe.\u201dThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "body": "Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Greater Boston Food Bank has gone from distributing a million pounds of food a week to two and a half million in Eastern Massachusetts, and this winter promises to be even more challenging. Catherine D'Amato, Greater Boston Food Bank President and CEO, joined Joe Mathieu on Morning Edition to discuss the \u201cunprecedented\u201d rising demand for food across the state, and what people can do to help. According to a study from Feeding America, Massachusetts has experienced the largest relative increase in food insecurity this year, compared to all other states, at 59%. And Norfolk County has experienced the largest change in food insecurity of any county in the country for children, at 163%. D\u2019Amato says that one in eight people in the state are food-insecure, and one of five of those is a child. \u201cThis is a dramatic change from one in 13 just this past March,\u201d she said. ModuleThis season, the Greater Boston Food Bank anticipates nearly one million people will seek help. D\u2019Amato says pantries are reporting that up to 50% of individuals who are seeking help have never visited a food bank before. \u201cThat's a direct result of unemployment and business closures,\u201d D\u2019Amato said. \u201cThis pandemic is pervasive. It's touching people in every way possible from sadness, loss of life, illness [and] loss of job.\u201dWatch: Is there a certain area that's seeing a higher demand?Raw HtmlGBFB launched a COVID relief task force back in February to prepare for the rise in need, and storms won\u2019t slow that effort this winter. \u201cWe are prepared any time there's inclement weather,\u201d D\u2019Amato said. \u201cWe live in New England. This is not new to us.\u201d What\u2019s new is social distancing, and D\u2019Amato says GBFB has risen to the challenge of distributing food to people despite the logistical challenges of social distancing, PPE, and limited volunteers. Even as the historic COVID vaccine ushers in hope, D\u2019Amato says families will still struggle. \u201cThe solution is political and personal will, along with food and making sure that the access to healthy food is consistent and available to all communities, all 351 towns in our Commonwealth.\u201d For anyone wishing to help, D\u2019Amato recommends advocacy, calling the Massachusetts delegation to encourage a COVID relief package, and donating to the Food Bank at GBFB.org.",

      "body": "When you talk to Thomas White at school or look at a college application, he\u2019s simply Thomas.But if you catch him in Southie, he\u2019s Tommy White. \u201cI mean, in my house, everybody here calls me Thomas. In Southie, especially at basketball and stuff, people usually call me Tommy. And that\u2019s just the name I was given,\" he said, with a laugh. White is chronicling his senior year of high school with GBH News as part of our COVID and the Classroom series. It\u2019s a moniker fitting for the South Boston neighborhood White hails from that can still feel like a village despite years of gentrification. And he\u2019s done his part to give back to it.In a typical year, he spends time working with Southie kids in camps and basketball clinics. While he\u2019s been able to do that at least a little bit this year, it hasn\u2019t been the same in 2020. It\u2019s been a loss for a lot of people.A Boston Latin School track and cross country star, White didn\u2019t have a whole lot of confidence as an athlete growing up. But as he spent time with older teens in neighborhood programs, that began to change. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Dang, like they\u2019re so fast.\u2019 You know, I want to be them when I grow up,\" he said. \"And, getting to be that person for someone else is so important to me.\u201dDuring the summers, he works at the Edgerley Family South Boston Boy & Girls Club where he\u2019s become something of a local celebrity. \u201cThomas was definitely one of those people who are connected with a lot of the kids,\" said Tim Bothwell, the director of operations at the Boys and Girl\u2019s Club.This year, the Club ran a much smaller summer program for kids than usual. White was one of the teen staff who worked with kids for a socially distant six-week program in smaller cohorts. \u201cSome of these kids, who knows what they would have did throughout the summer,\" Bothwell said. \"Sit in the house, be on videogames and things like that. We were able to offer some sort of normalcy, for that matter, for them.\u201dBut this winter, there may be even fewer outlets for young kids to get away from screens and make connections with each other and older kids. The Catholic Youth Organization instructional basketball program where White helps coach 1st and 2nd graders is canceled because of the pandemic. The program caters to kids of all backgrounds. \u201cIf you\u2019re constantly at home dealing with, you know, people fighting or whatever, and you just go play basketball for an hour and just have fun with this kid who wants to go play basketball with you whose five years older than you and you know, kind of like a role model,\" White said. Sean Monahan, who helps run the boys program, says many of the kids need role models to look up to. At an even more basic level, they just need friends and a place to build confidence.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing that we\u2019re missing now,\" he said. \"And we\u2019re losing that social benefit from these kids getting together seeing their friends.\u201dJake Harrision is a senior at Boston Latin who plays on the basketball team and also hails from Southie. He met Thomas through the CYO basketball program as 7th graders. He realizes it\u2019s not just the kids who are missing out.\u201cBut I think it makes a way bigger impact on the parents, because they kind of don\u2019t get a break from the kids. Every Saturday morning for two hours they get to go and do whatever they want,\" he said. \"The energy is always gonna still be there, so it\u2019s a little bit more hard to handle for the parents.\u201dSometimes the kids White works will be honest and tell their young mentors about problems they\u2019re dealing with at home. Just being there for them can make a big difference. \u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t go fix every problem,\" he said \"But in the limited ability that I have, I can do those kind of things. And it does kind of suck not to get that opportunity.\u201dWhite gets to give to his community, yes, but he also admits it\u2019s simply fun. And in a year where so much has been taken away, even a little time together is a big deal for Tommy White and the kids who want to be him one day. ",

      "body": "The fate of the police reform bill passed by the state legislature earlier this month is up in the air. That's after Gov. Charlie Baker sent it back to lawmakers last week with changes. The governor takes issue with several of its provisions, including a limit on the use of facial recognition technology by police. Kade Crockford is director of the Technology for Liberty program at the ACLU of Massachusetts. She spoke with GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: Let's break down the limits this bill would put on facial recognition technology, because we hear about this referred to as a ban on facial recognition technology. But it's not a ban, rght?Kade Crockford: It's not a ban, no. What the legislature sent to the governor's desk a few weeks ago, and unfortunately what the governor rejected, is common-sense regulation that would ensure that we can use this technology with narrow limits and checks and balances in place in serious criminal investigations, like investigations of murders and kidnapings, to try to identify persons in images when police don't know who that person is through the Registry of Motor Vehicles' existing facial recognition program. So it would prohibit most government agencies from acquiring facial recognition technology, but it would enable the Registry of Motor Vehicles to continue using facial recognition to perform fraud checks to investigate fraud in licensing, and it would allow police to obtain warrants to ask the RMV to search against that database to try to identify people in serious criminal investigations. It would also allow police to get around that warrant requirement and go directly to the RMV for a search when there's an imminent threat of serious bodily harm or death. Rath: So the police would have access to this, but it would just involve a warrant or an emergency authorization, like you just mentioned. Crockford: That's right, yes. We were particularly concerned to see Gov. Baker, in his letter to the legislature, say that this technology has been instrumental in solving some serious crimes in Massachusetts. That was disturbing to us because it suggested that the governor may not understand what this legislation does, because nothing in this legislation would prevent the police from using this technology to investigate those types of serious crimes. We have reached out to the governor's office to offer to meet with him and his team to discuss their concerns about this section of the legislation. Unfortunately, we haven't heard from the governor's office. We would really like to be able to reach a compromise to deal with this problem now, because this is a key social justice and policing issue that belongs in this. Most of what the legislature is doing with the police reform bill is looking backwards, trying to address problems that have become systemic and ingrained in the culture of policing in the commonwealth. This section deals with a problem that is forward-looking. We are trying to prevent problems from unfolding in Massachusetts, and we believe that's really crucial, not only because Black and brown people who are overpoliced, are the most like to be targeted with this software, but also because there are numbers of studies, including one from MIT done by the academic Joy Buolamwini, showing that facial recognition algorithms tend to be racially biased themselves \u2014 exhibiting error rates when evaluating the faces of Black women, for example, up to one in three times. So it is extremely important that the legislature work with us and our other community partners to make sure we can get to \"yes\" on legislation that brings some common-sense regulation to this dangerous and currently unregulated technology. Rath: To give us a sense of how these are current real-world concerns \u2014 Gov. Baker says that this technology has helped to solve crimes. Do you know what kind of things he's referring to there and what he might be concerned about this legislation disrupting? Crockford: So it's actually unclear, unfortunately, because as I said, the examples that he gave in the letter rejecting Section 26 did not seem to make any sense, because this legislation, Section 26 of the police reform bill regulating facial recognition technology, would in fact enable police to continue using the technology in precisely the types of investigations Gov. Baker flagged. But, you know, your question raises a really important point, which is that far too often, and this is the case with facial recognition technology, we see the government in the Executive Branch, the police departments, the State Police, going ahead and adopting and using very controversial, and in this case sometimes racially biased, technologies without a public debate, without legislative authorization and without the attendant checks and balances like a warrant protection that a legislative process would produce. That is deeply concerning to us, because what we know in Massachusetts is that the police have been accessing the Registry of Motor Vehicles facial recognition system to perform these searches in criminal investigations for about 15 years now. They've been doing that entirely in secret \u2014 in fact, not even notifying criminal defendants that the technology was used in their cases to identify them, which we believe is a significant due process violation. What we're aiming to do here is to bring this technology under small-d democratic control, to subject it to very common sense checks and balances, the same kind of oversight and accountability mechanisms that everyone expects from the criminal legal system \u2014 going to a judge to demonstrate that there's probable cause that someone may be involved in a serious crime and then taking the warrant that they obtain from that court to the RMV to ask for a search. Rath: We know facial recognition technology has a disproportionate effect on communities of color. I remember, you know, getting Google to recognize my relatives. Going back to that point, we've seen this play out. But can you explain how how this plays out in the real world, how it how it hurts communities of color in practice? Crockford: Absolutely. So there have been a few cases. In fact, in June, The New York Times published a really horrifying story out of Detroit. Again, you know, the use of facial recognition by police in Michigan is totally unregulated as it is in Massachusetts, and that has devastating consequences. So we know now of at least two Black men who have been wrongfully arrested by the Detroit Police Department, including Mr. Robert Williams, whose story was told in The New York Times in June. He was arrested in front of his two small children and his wife for a crime he didn't commit. He went down to the police station, and he said he felt like he was in \"The Twilight Zone\" in the interrogation room when the police handed him a still image from a video surveillance camera of the suspect in this theft and said, this is you, right? And Mr. Williams said, do you seriously think all black men look alike? And the police let it slip that the error came from facial recognition. They said, oops, the computer must have gotten it wrong. So that's exactly the type of situation that we need to prevent from happening here in Massachusetts. And, you know, the ACLU is far from alone here. We have a coalition of nearly 60 organizations that are supporting these crucial reforms. A number of Boston Celtics players came out and spoke out publicly on this issue, on their social media accounts, including Jaylen Brown, the small forward, number seven for the Boston Celtics, saying the legislature needs to get to \"yes\" on this to protect Black and brown people and to ensure racial justice in the 21st century in the commonwealth.",

      "body": "Ahead of spring break, college administrators were frantically adapting to the novel coronavirus. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brandeis University, Bunker Hill Community College and most other schools abruptly moved their classes online, sending thousands of students packing.As hospitals braced for a surge in patients with COVID-19, Tufts University President Tony Monaco suggested colleges with surplus dorm rooms should make them available as overflow ICU beds if needed.\u201cI believe this is our country\u2019s Dunkirk moment,\u201d Monaco said, referring to the World War II battle. \u201cWe need local efforts to help our local hospitals manage the number of patients and the spread through the community.\u201dThe year 2020 will go down as one that reshaped the landscape for colleges, with COVID-19 and the racial reckoning changing the state's campuses. The pandemic put financial pressure on local colleges, caused enrollment to dip and largely shifted teaching and learning from in-person to online. Schools' professed commitment to diversity and inclusion turned scrutiny on how much contracting they do with businesses owned by people of color. After a UMass Boston undergrad returning from China was the first college student in the state to be quarantined, public health officials warned we were bound to see more cases on campuses in what one observer described as \u201ca slow-roll crisis.\u201dColleges reacted swiftly to the pandemic in other ways. The state changed rules to allow medical students to get certified before they graduated \u2014 a move intended to stem anticipated pressure on the health care system.\u201cThis is no longer a drill. This is the real thing,\" said UMass Worcester Chancellor Michael Collins, who welcomed the relaxing of licensing rules. \"That would bring thousands and thousands of workers into the workforce if we need them.\"A GBH News survey this spring, though, found the state\u2019s community colleges graduated just 63 respiratory therapists \u2014 students like Leann Ritchie of Stockbridge \u2014 who are desperately needed on the frontlines of the pandemic to operate ventilators that could save the lives of patients most seriously ill with COVID-19. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that respiratory therapists are needed now and actually being recognized, instead of just doctors and nurses,\u201d Ritchie said in April. The first wave subsided over the summer and college administrators turned their collective attention to reopening, juggling privacy and public safety. City officials and professors criticized schools for deciding to bring students back to campus. Boston University epidemiologist Michael Siegel accused his own school of being reckless \u2014 more concerned about its bottom line than public health. \u201cWhat this really comes down to is tuition dollars,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cThe school was concerned that if it only offered online classes that a lot of students might defer or might decide to go elsewhere.\u201dAs the fall semester approached, colleges were facing lawsuits seeking tuition refunds and requiring that students sign either letters acknowledging risk or waivers agreeing not to sue if they contract the virus. Schools purchased plexiglass, hand sanitizer and PPE. The key, however, would be frequent testing.Colleges like Northeastern and Boston University invested millions of dollars in their own COVID tests. Others partnered with Harvard and MIT\u2019s Broad Institute and the virus was largely contained on campuses. The superspreading that city officials feared never happened.\u201cNew England is crushing it,\u201d said Chris Marsicano, who directs the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College, which is tracking colleges\u2019 COVID responses. His research team finds that in New England, 90 percent of colleges offering some in-person classes did frequent testing before the Thanksgiving break.\u201cThere's no region that has a greater proportion of its institutions testing weekly or bi-weekly than New England,\u201d Marsicano said. Broad, which has conducted much of the testing in New England, says about one to two in 1,000 on-campus tests came back positive this semester.\u201cHere in Massachusetts, I think we\u2019re actually lighting the way to how to live and learn in the age of COVID,\u201d said Laurie Leshin, president of Worcester Polytechnic Institute, which partnered with Broad to test its students, faculty and staff on a weekly basis. Leshin's school, she said, managed to stay open with relatively low case numbers.\u201cI really sincerely hope that other parts of the country look to our successful model and set up a way that they can do the same because we\u2019ve shown that it\u2019s possible to stay open and keep operating,\u201d she said.Many are operating in the red. So far, the New England Board of Higher Education has estimated the pandemic has cost the region\u2019s colleges nearly half a billion dollars in tuition and fees, and that estimate doesn\u2019t even account for COVID-related expenses.The number of students at two-year colleges plummeted. Accreditors put Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston on notice because of its shaky finances. Historically, these two-year schools have gained enrollment during recessions because workers return to school hoping to get a better job when the economy improves. But this year, enrollment fell by about 12 percent at the state\u2019s community colleges. That\u2019s compared to a 7 percent decline at its public four-year universities. \u201cStudents are not enrolling at the same rate because this pandemic has caught all of us flat-footed,\u201d said Bunker Hill Community College President Pam Eddinger, noting that a big reason for this devastating drop is that students who were already enrolled stopped out.\u201cThis pandemic has too many different elements that are volatile,\u201d Eddinger explained. \u201cIt's not just, \u2018The jobs are disappearing for a little bit and you can retrain for something else.\u2019 Restaurants are closing. My culinary students, even if I trained them some more, have nowhere to go.\u201dWhile college enrollment was down nationally, medical school applications were way up \u2013 18 percent nationwide compared to last year. At Boston University they were up 27 percent. Admissions experts cited the pandemic, the economy, and what behind closed doors they\u2019re calling the \u201cFauci Effect.\u201d\u201cIf it works to get more young individuals into medical school, go ahead and use my name. Be my guest,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, told GBH News. Fauci said he sees the flood of medical school applicants as a sign that young people are thinking about their responsibility to others.\u201cThat counterbalances, I hope, the other side of the coin, which is the fact that people have no regard at all for society and only just focusing very selfishly on themselves,\u201d he said.The pandemic and economic downturn weren\u2019t the only crises reshaping colleges and admissions. Like the rest of the country, campuses also responded to the racial reckoning following the murder of George Floyd in May.As unrest gripped the world, college presidents who have long embraced diversity and inclusion pledged to do better and to address income and racial inequality. A GBH News investigation, though, found local colleges don\u2019t spend much money with businesses owned by people of color.This fall, Lee Pelton, Emerson College's president, called on the state\u2019s colleges to diversify their contract spending to help close the racial wealth gap.\u201cWe know that minority-owned businesses generate economic output not only directly, but also by buying goods and services from other businesses,\u201d he said. While a few colleges, including the University of Massachusetts, have recently committed to a roadmap, Pelton admits it\u2019s hard to gain traction during the pandemic and economic downturn when college budgets are so tight and administrators are just trying to keep the lights on.In the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, Harvard in November again fended off a federal lawsuit alleging that its admissions process discriminated against Asian Americans. The 2-0 decision came after one member of the three-judge panel, Juan Torruella, died in late October.While focused on the Ivy League school, the case could impact college admissions at selective schools across the country. The plaintiffs, who oppose race-conscious admissions designed to increase diversity on campus, say they will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court next year.",

      "body": "The ceremony to swear in Judge Serge Georges to the Supreme Judicial Court, like most other events during the pandemic, was scaled back from the usual fanfare that accompanies such affairs.Justice Serge Georges (right) embraced his friend Robert Bruhl who flew in from Hawaii to watch Georges be sworn in at the State House as a member of the Supreme Judicial Court. [Nancy Lane/Boston Herald/Pool]But Georges, who wore a maroon Boston College Eagles facemask while taking the oath of office, still welcomed family and friends to mark the moment, including one former classmate from his undergraduate days at Chestnut Hill who traveled all the way from Hawaii.That friend, Robert Bruhl, wrote a letter of recommendation on Georges's behalf that Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito described as \"the best letter of recommendation I have ever read\" -- so good that Polito kept a folded-up copy in her pocket during Wednesday's ceremony -- detailing a bound, black journal that Georges gave as a gift 17 years ago to mark the birth of Bruhl's first child.\"By that time, we had been close friends for a decade, and he knew how tender the gift would be, and it came with a solemn message as its inscription: 'Be committed to this,'\" Polito read from the letter. \"If you were looking for someone to toe the line, he's not your guy.\"Georges, a 50-year-old Boston Municipal Court judge, cruised through his nomination process, earning a unanimous confirmation vote from the Governor's Council.Before taking the oath, Georges repeated a pledge that he made to Gov. Charlie Baker and Polito earlier in the process when he was still being weighed as a candidate for a spot on the high court.\"I know you didn't put me here to do anything other than what I think is right, but I do want you all to remember what I said to you at the interview: I won't let you down,\" he said.With Georges officially sworn in, the SJC is back up to full strength with seven members. The sudden death of Chief Justice Ralph Gants in September and the retirement this month of Justice Barbara Lenk contributed to a further reshuffling of a court that has undergone a full turnover during Baker's years in office.Georges joins Baker's two other recent picks -- Justice Kimberly Budd, who was elevated to chief justice, and Justice Dalila Wendlandt -- to complete the governor's reshaping of the state's highest court.All seven current members were nominated by Baker and confirmed by the elected Governor's Council, a nearly unprecedented feat and one that's simply not available to most governors.Georges, the son of Haitian immigrants, will be the third nonwhite member of the historically white panel alongside Wendlandt and Budd.He also brings a unique perspective as a district court judge. Only a handful of SJC justices in the court's lengthy history, including fellow current Justice David Lowy, have served on district courts before joining the high panel.At his confirmation hearing, Georges said that experience will help tether key decisions to the impacts they will carry on the ground.\"We are thrilled that you applied and we're very excited to see what kind of a path you cut over the course of your time in this critically important role at this very important moment in our state's history,\" Baker told Georges.",

      "body": "Massachusetts is one of only six states in the country to included incarcerated populations and prison and jail staff in the first phase of its vaccine distribution plan.Elizabeth Matos, executive director of Prisoners' Legal Services, says it's a good first step, but says the details of how this would actually work within the Department of Corrections is still being ironed out. She says a big struggle will be getting buy-in from both incarcerated people and DOC staff because of widespread vaccine and healthcare skepticism.Matos adds while many have described a coronavirus vaccine as a light at the end of a tunnel, many of those who are incarcerated only see one thing.\"For people who are in these facilities right now that are experiencing outbreaks, the only tunnel they're looking at is a death tunnel,\" said Matos. \"They are quite literally facing down the barrel of death because they know they have co-morbidities. They know they have the very kinds of medical vulnerabilities that the CDC has said makes people prone to death from COVID. They're seeing their cell mates and fellow prisoners being hospitalized, and placed on ventilators, and passing away. And so they are very afraid of not being able to get home because they're going to end up dying from COVID while incarcerated.\"We also heard from Dr. Greg Leslie, the hospital medicine site director for the UMass Memorial DCU Center Field Hospital in Worcester.

      "body": "The COVID pandemic. Millions of American calling \u2014 and fighting \u2014 for racial equality and social justice. The 2020 Presidential Election. These three ongoing stories dominated not just the headlines in 2020, but also the day-to-day lives of millions, as we all attempted to navigate uniquely precarious waters. These topics also inspired many of the questions we here at the Curiosity Desk asked \u2014 and sought to answer \u2014 this year. Here are a few we think are worth revisiting as we reflect on a year like no other. 1. Revisiting And Reckoning With A Massachusetts Town's 1973 Vote Against Racial InclusionWhen I came across a brief mention of a 1973 vote at Town Meeting in the small town of Ashby, Massachusetts, my jaw nearly hit the floor. Residents there voted 148-79 against adopting a resolution that would \u201cinvite members of minority groups into town.\u201d This action landed Ashby on Sociologist James W. Loewen\u2019s list of American \u201csundown towns.\u201d These are towns \u2014 mainly in the North \u2014 that were, or still are, as he puts it, \u201call-white on purpose.\u201d Nearly 50 years on, I reached out to one of the people involved in the vote, and spoke with a current Ashby resident who told me that if the same vote were held today, she\u2019s not sure the result would be any different. 2. How Christopher Columbus Came To Stand In Boston's North EndIn cities and towns across America, public monuments to controversial historical figures came under renewed scrutiny in 2020. Boston was no exception \u2014 the Christopher Columbus statue in the North End was beheaded and then taken down completely. Christopher Columbus was an especially important figure for Italian immigrants and Italian-Americans at the turn of the 20th century, as they sought to gain acceptance here amidst rampant discrimination. But he\u2019s also long been a problematic \u201chero\u201d whose arrival in the Western Hemisphere marked the beginning of centuries of atrocities, from the enslavement of millions to the systemic murder and displacement of indigenous peoples throughout the Americas. Amidst the controversy, I looked into how this particular statue came to stand in the North End, why it still means so much to some residents, and why \u2014 for others \u2014 its removal was long overdue. 3. Meet The People Trying To Seed A New Generation Of Black FarmersPerhaps because I have family members who work on farms, I find myself endlessly interested in the complexities of the agricultural industry. And, like many reporters, I\u2019m also a fan of big data sets. This year, I found myself combing through the most recent USDA Agricultural Statistics Survey, which contains detailed information about Massachusetts' 7,000+ farms, what they produce, and who they employ. As I poked around, I learned that while more than 5,000 of those farms are individually owned and operated, only 21 of them are owned and operated by a Black individual. I began reaching out to local farmer of color and learned about some of the unique challenges they face \u2014 and met some of the people fighting to seed a new generation of Black farmers here in New England. 4. Are Most Massachusetts Residents Wearing Masks?As it became clear that wearing a face covering in public is one of the most important tools we have to slow the spread of the coronavirus, one question that kept coming up in the newsroom was a simple one: Are people actually doing it? And while the question is simple, answering it definitively was nearly impossible. Still, there is something to be said for the insight that can be gained by simply observing and reporting what you see. And so, I enlisted four of my GBH News colleagues. Each of us headed out to a different part of the state and spent time watching people, noting who\u2019s faces were covered and who\u2019s weren\u2019t, and talking with some of them about why they were \u2014 or weren\u2019t \u2014 wearing masks 5. How The New England Aquarium 'First Responders' Are Caring For 20,000 Animals During The PandemicA lot of area businesses were forced to close their doors in 2020, and each faced a unique set of challenges as they fought to survive during the pandemic. Many faced a near-total loss of revenue. Many had to pivot countless times and invent new ways of reaching their customers. Many had to make the difficult decision to furlough or lay off significant portions of their workforce. But only one had to also figure out how to keep 20,000 animals alive in the process. ",

      "body": "Boston\u2019s City Council approved a compromise measure to create a new office to investigate and monitor Boston Police affairs. It its final session of the year, the council Wednesday passed an ordinance establishing the Office of Police Accountability and Transparency, or OPAT by a vote of 12 to 1. Dorchester councilor Frank Baker was the lone \u201cno\u201d vote. The measure reconciles two different proposals for strong civilian oversight of police \u2013 one filed by councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Andrea Campbell and Julia Mejia in July, another put forward by Mayor Marty Walsh and his police reform panel via executive order last month.The new, three-pronged office would include an administrative arm; an investigatory arm to review Boston Police Department internal affairs cases; and a civilian review board which would review civilian complaints against the department. Mayor Walsh did not indicate whether he intends to sign the ordinance, but many on the council praised it as a long overdue step for Boston. \u201cPassing this ordinance would be a win for the city, a major step towards eliminating racial disparities in policing while creating greater transparency, accountability and justice in our system,\u201d said councilor Andrea Campbell. Campbell, a 2021 mayoral candidate, has for three years been pushing for a stronger civilian review board -- to no effect until Boston and the nation was rocked by protests in the wake of the police killing in May of George Floyd in Minneapolis.The council attempted to put more teeth into Walsh's proposal, by mandating that the police commissioner be bound by the findings of the new civilian review board. The council, in the end, backed away from that position.\u201cMy concern on this is this [ordinance] passes and it doesn\u2019t get signed [by the mayor] and we\u2019re right back here again in January,\u201d said Counselor Michael Flaherty who was concerned about preserving the autonomy of the commissioner.Under the provisions of the council's proposed measure, the police commissioner, should he reject a finding of the civilian review board, would have to explain to the board why he rejected its recommendation.In a statement to GBH News Wednesday evening, Mayor Walsh referred back to the executive orders he filed under the advisement of the police reform task force and vowed to assess the ordinance in consultation with members of the panel.\u201cOur city is stronger and better because of their work and advocacy,\" the statement said, \"and we look forward to reviewing the language passed by the City Council today to ensure it aligns as closely as possible to their recommendations and the original ordinance we put forward this fall.\u201d",

      "body": "House Speaker Robert DeLeo's office pushed back Wednesday evening on a report that he would be stepping down to take a job at Northeastern University after a day in which speculation ran rampant on Beacon Hill that the Winthrop Democrat's 12-year reign might be ending.DeLeo's office still has not said whether he has plans to step down or if he will run for a seventh term next month as speaker and continue what is already the longest tenure in the top job in the House of Representative in state history.A spokeswoman for DeLeo, however, denied a report from NBC 10 Boston that the speaker was leaving for a job at his alma mater Northeastern University.\"The Speaker has had no such talks with, much less does he have any agreement with, Northeastern University,\" spokeswoman Catherine Williams said in a one-sentence statement to the News Service.Williams did not respond to follow up questions about his future, and DeLeo also had not filed any ethics disclosures with the House clerk's office or the State Ethics Commission as of Wednesday afternoon that might reveal his interest in outside employment.DeLeo left his office around 7 p.m. Wednesday, exiting the building through a back door to his car on Mount Vernon Street, clad in a Bruins cap and accompanied by House legal counsel James Kennedy. He did not comment or respond to several questions about whether he would be stepping down.Speculation about DeLeo's future reached a fever pitch on Wednesday as House members gathered both remotely and in person at the State House to begin considering amendments to the annual state budget returned by Gov. Charlie Baker.While it has not been uncommon in recent years for chatter about DeLeo's to turn up in volume near the start of a new session, the intensity this year has been higher, according to people who work inside and outside the State House, and people are paying it more attention.First elected in 1990, DeLeo, 70, has spent 30 years of his professional career in the House, and what he would do next remains unknown. The speaker is an attorney, and though some close to him don't believe he would want to go into lobbying, he has often been linked to a move to Northeastern when his time in the Legislature comes to an end.

Additionally, A Blue Heron Christmas Special will also present the world premiere performance of \u201cPuer nobis nascitur\u201d by the Chicago-based composer Kevin Allen.\u201cOne of the reasons that Kevin was such an ideal choice for this is that he's very much influenced by Renaissance techniques,\u201d says Blue Heron Artistic Director Scott Metcalfe. \u201cA lot of the techniques that he's using have their origins in the 15th and 16th century...but then it\u2019s all taken into his own style.\u201d\"A Christmas Carol Live,\" streaming via the Huntington Theatre Company website and theaters across the country through January 3A Christmas Carol LiveBased on the acclaimed 2018 production that started at Los Angeles\u2019 Geffen Playhouse, this one-man version of Charles Dickens\u2019 classic Christmas tale features Tony Award-winner Jefferson Mays as all the characters \u2014 from Ebenezer Scrooge to Tiny Tim to the peripatetic ghosts!

      "body": "As state and local officials implore people to remain at home throughout the holidays and pandemic surge, many have been taking on more home cooking. Christopher Kimball, the man behind Milk Street, a TV and radio program, and author of the new cookbook Cookish: Throw It Together joined host Joe Mathieu on GBH\u2019s Morning Edition to share ideas for keeping it fresh in the kitchen.\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s like to get sick of your own cooking?\u201d Mathieu asked.\u201cUh, yeah \u2014 when you open that fridge at five o\u2019clock every day and go \u2018oh no!\u2019 And it\u2019s the same stuff that was there the last five days. Absolutely,\u201d said Kimball. In order to combat boredom in the kitchen, he suggested investing in some key pantry items, like fermented sauces (oyster sauce, fish sauce) as well as pomegranate molasses, spices, and other flavorful ingredients.\u201cGet a dozen good things, so that if you pull out eggplant or you pull out chicken or you pull out some beans you can flavor stuff so many different ways with that,\u201d said Kimball. \u201cThat\u2019s really the secret, is starting with big flavors.\u201dAll of the recipes in Cookish feature just six ingredients and a single piece of cookwear. \u201cSo we\u2019re streamlining things, and you must be putting a lot of thought into the new ingredients that you\u2019re bringing into your kitchen,\u201d said Mathieu.Kimball shared that he\u2019s not typically a fan of limited-ingredient cookbooks and their many shortcuts, but \u201cif you\u2019re very careful with the kinds of ingredients you use\u201d you can make a flavorful dish with just a few quality ingredients.WATCH: Kimball on cooking with bold global flavorsRaw HtmlAs to whether his adventurous cooking style is a departure from the traditional dishes of his New England roots, Kimball responded that while pancakes and apple pie are still two of his favorite foods, New England cuisine in general lacks the big flavors he is drawn to.\u201cIt\u2019s very good food, but it\u2019s not food that layers on flavor and texture. It\u2019s not complex in terms of what\u2019s going on in your mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cOther places in the world, I think, do things with a little more complexity, a little more contrast.\u201d He offered the example of baked beans, which are made in New England to be sweet, whereas in Mexico they are \u201camazing,\u201d packed with complex flavors.Will Kimball be taking on any holiday baking this year? \u201cWe have young kids, so it isn\u2019t about the cookie, it\u2019s about the stuff you put on it,\u201d he said, noting that his wife is the baker in the family. He prefers Moravian cookies, typically made with molasses and spices, as well as Swedish cookies, which typically include vanilla, almond, and lots of butter.WATCH: Kimball's tips for cooking for a small groupRaw HtmlFor those who are celebrating the holidays solo or with just immediate family this year, Kimball suggested sticking with a smaller roast, like a tenderloin, as well as soups and stews, which can be easily scaled down. Or go big and live off the leftovers, like he did for Thanksgiving. \u201cI did a huge turkey this year, I did a 20-pounder. And I just stopped eating it recently. It was a lot of leftovers,\u201d said Kimball. Throw on a quick pan sauce or spice rub for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 big flavor.Try these recicipes from Cookish: Throw It Together today!Module",

      "body": "Massachusetts House Speaker Robert DeLeo is negotiating a job at Northeastern University, a move that would end his 12 year tenure as perhaps the most powerful figure in state government.The news, revealed in an ethics dislosure filed with the House Clerk on Friday, ends days of intense speculation on Beacon Hill.DeLeo is the longest-serving speaker in state history.In over five full terms, DeLeo oversaw an incremental liberal agenda while resisting most broad tax increases and keeping an unwavering grip on power. To achieve that, he worked through his chosen \u2014 and extremely loyal \u2014 team of chairs and floor leaders to generate broad consensus within the House.His likely successor is Majority Leader Ronald Mariano, a 74-year old from Quincy who's been in the House for just under 30 years and is a close DeLeo ally. Mariano supporters who spoke to GBH News said he has more than enough votes to be elected speaker.\u201cIf Speaker DeLeo resigns, I will be a candidate for speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives,\" Mariano said in a press statement distributed Friday afternoon. \"I believe I have earned the trust and confidence of my colleagues and that I have gained their support to lead the House forward.\" Gov. Charlie Baker cautioned lawmakers not to let a transition of power in the House distract from pressing legislative issues that have only days to pass before the end of the session.\"I hope that in the midst of whatever it is that's going to happen on this issue here, that agenda, which is still very much alive, real and needs to get done sometime between now and Jan. 4 ... gets done,\" Baker said at his daily COVID-19 press conference.In a statement circulated to the press Friday, a spokesperson for Northeastern University wrote that the school is \"looking forward to discussing with Speaker DeLeo opportunities to welcome him back to his alma mater.\"Like DeLeo, Mariano is seen as a moderate Democrat. When it comes to abortion access, for example, Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts considers him an ally. The party's left wing, however, takes a dimmer view. Progressive Massachusetts gives Mariano a \"D\" when it comes to supporting the agenda shared by most left-wing activists.The unwavering anti-tax Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance rated Mariano's voting record for last session at 2%. That's a bit lower than the average for most Democrats and is identical to DeLeo's score.Mariano said that in the final days of the Legislature's 2019 \u2013\u00a02020 session, \"the House must remain focused on rejecting Governor Baker\u2019s efforts to weaken a woman\u2019s right to choose and to dilute our police reform legislation,\" hitting on two of the most pressing matters lawmakers say they intend to wrap up before the new year.Baker said he and his team know Mariano from years of working with him on health care policy.\"Rob Mariano, for all intents and purposes, is probably the the key voice in the House on health care issues, and we spent a lot of time with him talking about health care over the last five years,\" Baker said. DeLeo rose to power in 2009 after former Speaker Sal DiMasi resigned amid an ethics investigation and conviction on corruption charges for which he served five years in federal prison.DeLeo released the following statement Friday:\u201cToday I filed a disclosure letter with the House Clerk and the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission to disclose that I intend to begin negotiating prospective employment opportunities with Northeastern University. As of today, I have not personally had any discussions with anyone from Northeastern University relative to any possible employment opportunities.\u201cOn December 16, 2020, I requested that my personal legal counsel contact the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission to discuss my status and to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Conflict of Interest Law. Although, based on my current status, a disclosure is not currently required I have nevertheless elected to disclose my intention to begin negotiating prospective employment opportunities with Northeastern University out of an abundance of caution.\u201cAs such, and while I know of no matter, particular matter or general legislation presently before me in my official role that would affect Northeastern University, I filed the disclosure to dispel any appearance of conflict pursuant to G.L. c. 268A, s. 23(b)(3).\u201d",

      "body": "It's time to say goodbye to an unprecedented year. This month, we asked our Mass Mix contributors to choose their favorite songs released in 2020. Many gravitated toward tunes filled with energy, ethereal sounds, melancholy, comfort, and anger. Here's what they said.I ThinkAlaina Ray, \u201cI Think\u201dOne of the more notable songs this year was from local newcomer pop artist Alaina Ray. Following two other stellar singles as an introduction, she capped off the year with a final release called \u201cI Think.\u201d The song balances a unique juxtaposition of melancholy lyrics while presented within a light-hearted feel-good sound. With its catchy hook, slick production, relatable lyrics, and a captivating voice which would capture any music fan\u2019s attention, Ray not only made a large splash into the local music world, but with songs as good as this who knows how long she\u2019ll remain \u201clocal\u201d at all. -Joel Gray, Editor-in-Chief, The Lowell SpinIDLES - GROUNDS (Official Video)IDLES, \"Grounds\"In December, I'm usually pouring over my favorite songs and albums of the previous year, tinkering with rankings, delegating on-the-cusp releases to \"Honorable Mention\" status, etc. 2020 isn't like that. My faves have all fallen nicely into place because they've become dear companions over the course of this year of isolation, this year of upheaval. Ultra Mono from IDLES is one of these. It's pure, positive energy: a kick in the seat of the pants when I need it. \"Grounds\" captures the spirit of the protests for social justice we all witnessed this summer. \"Do you hear that thunder? That's the sound of strength in numbers.\" That's a song and a message worth taking away from a busted-up 2020. -Adam 12, Weekdays 11a-4p, ROCK 92.9Frances Quinlan - Your Reply [Official Audio]Frances Quinlan, \u201cYour Reply\u201d One song I have been listening to non-stop this year is \"Your Reply\" by Frances Quinlan, the frontwoman of Hop Along. The instrumentation on Quinlan's debut Likewise is light and dreamy, featuring acoustic guitars, a harp, and synthesizers. Quinlan's ragged, energetic voice on the album makes her stories even more captivating with minimal instrumentation, keeping your attention during every line she sings. Filled with literary references and pieces of candid dialogue, \"Your Reply\" is a charming song that captures the story of someone who can't seem to understand another person who's close to them. \"If anything, the speaker is frustrated at coming so close to understanding another person completely,\" Quinlan said about the song. \"But still what a gift that is, to come close.\" Though Likewise was released in January, the whimsy of \"Your Reply\" helped me get over a case of pandemic fatigue in the fall, transporting me directly into the narrator's world and making me forget about social distancing and isolation for just a moment. -Lea Tatoris, Program Coordinator and Playground Host, WERS 88.9FMRaw HtmlAxestrumentals, \u201cRun My Errands\u201dOne of my \"on repeat\" songs of 2020 is \"Run My Errands\" by Boston-based rapper and producer, Axestrumentals. I love this song's up-tempo beat because it gives off feel-good summer vibes, which I always welcome, especially this year. It also has socially conscious lyrics without profanity, which you'll find with a lot of Axestrumentals' music. I'm not suggesting that songs with a \"parental advisory\" sticker don't have the same impact on the ear, but there's something to be said about an artist who provides dope lyricism without it. -Danielle Anderson, Social Media Manager, BAMS FestCan You Hear My ThoughtsTomtsu, \"Can You Hear My Thoughts?\" This song is perfect. Or, at least, it feels that way, contextually: It was released March 5 of this year, less than two weeks before the pandemic took full hold of the country and the world. Tomtsu, consisting \u2014 then \u2014 of four Brookline High School students, recorded and released a song that feels at once ethereal, beautiful, and somber, the lead singer asking throughout: \"Can you hear my thoughts?\" Of course, this felt fitting given having to, in early March, wave goodbye to an old-time and brace for the new. As we began to burrow into quarantine, this song kept bumping around my head. How is it possible to feel so separated yet uncomfortably close? How can I truly know how others feel in a time when social interactions are almost completely digital? How can I strive to be authentic at a time like this, heart-wrenchingly traumatic yet stiflingly boring? \"Can You Hear My Thoughts?\" \u2014 melancholic, nostalgic, and cathartic \u2014 offers not so much an answer as it does a reframing of the question. You are already in the ideal headspace to hear this song: You have suffered through this pandemic, and you are alive. Exit your other tabs, turn off your phone, close your eyes, and listen. -N. Malte Collins, Editor, Sound of Boston Janelle Mon\u00e1e - Turntables [Emotion Picture]Janelle Mon\u00e1e, \u201cTurntables\u201dThis was the year of a public health crisis and also the year of protest and revolution. That's why I often turned to Janelle Mon\u00e1e's music, which is always joyous yet urgent and prescient when it comes to issues of justice. She wrote \"Turntables\" for the Amazon documentary All In: The Fight for Democracy, an exploration of voter suppression, and in the song, she calls for \"liberation, elevation, education.\" It's a soundtrack for the revolution we have been engaged in since the start of this country. The video, which she calls an 'emotional picture,' weaves together images of the civil rights struggles of the past with images of what an inclusive America could like in the future when the tables are finally turned. -Meghan Smith, Digital Producer, GBHSoft Kill - \"Pretty Face\" (Official Music Video)Soft Kill, \u201cPretty Face\u201dWith all of the insanity that is 2020, I\u2019ve relied heavily on music to cope. That said, selecting just one song to be the epitome of my year is, at best, crazily difficult. Since I have to pick one, it\u2019d probably be \u201cPretty Face\u201d off Soft Kill\u2019s, Dead Kids R.I.P. City. It was the second single off of the November release, and it was the band\u2019s way of coping with survivor\u2019s guilt after the loss of a very close friend. The musicality of the song is bright and cheerful while still maintaining the band\u2019s postpunk heart. But there\u2019s a distinct split between the sound and the dark lyrics, and the refrain of, \u201crelax your pretty face boy/ the pain has left you.\u201d I\u2019ve had to navigate loss in its many forms this year and this song, though arriving late in the year, comes as a welcome companion and a soothing balm after what has assuredly been a treacherous time for us all. -Ashley Kreutter, Music Section Manager and Associate Music Editor, Boston HassleRaw Html",

      "body": "For years, elected officials and residents of western Massachusetts have longed for a high-speed passenger rail service that would provide a more efficient and easier way to travel between the two halves of the state. For the past two years the state\u2019s DOT has spent $1 million studying three possible plans and, after several delays, a final report is due out by the end of this year.The proposals range in cost from $2.4 billion to $4.6 billion, depending in the amount of new track that would have to be built and the realignments that would have to be made. The benefit-to-cost ratio of any of the plans is far below the minimum required for federal money, and without federal funding there is little chance the new line could be built.Ridership is estimated to be between 280,000 and 470,000, which proponents claim is too low. They point to the success of the Downeaster \u2014 which runs between Boston and Portland, Maine and has doubled its initial ridership estimates. For Western Mass State Sen. Eric Lesser, the rail link is essential for the state to grow. \u201cThe two most important issues are a lack of jobs in western Massachusetts and a lack of housing in eastern Massachusetts. Make it easier to commute and more folks will live here and work in Boston, boosting both economies.\u201d ",

Russell Holmes doesn't want \"backroom deals\" to decide the next leader of the Massachusetts House of Representative, so he's challenging Majority Leader Ron Mariano's bid to become speaker assuming Robert DeLeo departs.\"I do not think that these things should happen in secret, which is exactly what was going to happen,\" Holmes told GBH News at the State House on Friday.\"The commonwealth should know that a new speaker's been elected, and they should have a voice to all their reps to make sure that they ask for transparency. They ask for more fairness. They ask that we don't concentrate all the power within just a couple of people, which is the way it's been obviously for the last decade,\" Holmes said.Holmes said he's concerned that a pattern of hand-picked succession initiated by former Speaker Sal DiMasi, who spent five years in federal prison for corruption, will continue through Mariano and on to DiMasi's former aide and current budget chief, Aaron Michlewitz.\"That, to me, really is unacceptable,\" Holmes said.DeLeo disclosed Friday that he's entering discussions with his alma mater, Northeastern University, for a job.Holmes said he expects at least a few of his colleagues to vote for him when the time comes to select the next speaker.Homes was stripped of his vice chairmanship of the Housing Committee by DeLeo, reportedly for encouraging legislative caucuses outside of the speaker's inner circle to be more active in picking House leaders.Holmes said further retaliation from Mariano if he's elected will only harm the constituents of his Sixth Suffolk District, which includes parts of Mattapan and Dorchester \u2014 a district that votes overwhelmingly Democratic every election. Punishment for Holmes, in the form of stalled legislation or the removal of budget amendments by House leaders, \"means that you don't respect us,\" he said.\"You don't think that our legislation, our earmarks are most important? Our constituent services are most important? That's, just to me, structural racism personified,\" Holms said.\"If I lose this race, I'm certainly hoping that the point is made that the most reliable voters in this commonwealth for the Democratic Party should never be silenced,\" Holmes added.",

      "body": "Days after the Mass General Brigham hospital network began vaccinating its employees, healthcare staff have raised concerns the distribution system has been chaotic and inequitable. The problems, they said, stem partly from scheduling challenges and allowing hospital personnel to \u201cself-police.\u201d Doctors at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, one of the nation\u2019s most prestigious hospitals and part of the Mass General Brigham system, called the roll out a \u201crat race\u201d and a \u201cfree for all.\u201d  They said the system left some people who work directly with COVID patients unvaccinated, while others who have little or no contact with COVID patients have received vaccinations.  \u201cAfter working for 10 months in this pandemic, this feels like a slap in the face,\u201d said one doctor at Brigham and Women\u2019s who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. \u201cIt feels like they don't care about us.\u201d \u201cIt makes me feel awful that anyone feels anything less than fully valued,\u201d said Paul Biddinger, the medical director for emergency preparedness at Mass General Brigham. In an interview with GBH News, he acknowledged the challenges and missteps in rolling out a vaccination program for an organization with more than 80,000 employees.  Biddinger is also chair of Gov. Charlie Baker's Vaccine Advisory Group.\u201cThere are a lot of lessons to be learned in the communications and the roll out plan that we absolutely need to address,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cWe have been working on this very, very hard in the last couple of days, with changes coming starting tomorrow.\u201d For several weeks before Mass General Brigham received nearly 9,000 doses of the vaccine, it was busy preparing. Leadership sent a series of emails to the staff outlining the plan to distribute vaccines to its thousands of healthcare workers. They shared infographics to explain the roll out strategy and they hosted virtual town hall meetings.Employees would be eligible to receive the vaccine in waves. The first workers to receive the vaccine \u2014 those in \u201cWave A\u201d \u2014 included those who come into direct contact with COVID patients as part of their work. Mass General Brigham emphasized that this wave included not just doctors and nurses but also cleaners, transport personnel and others. These essential workers would verify their wave in an app called COVID Pass where you could sign up for a vaccine appointment. But, when the first vaccines came, the app crashed, and doctors started criticizing the hospital network's communication, as well as a core tenet of the distribution plan: an honor code in which employees simply answer a few questions in the app to confirm which wave they would be in.On Wednesday, the COVID Pass app \u2014 the same mobile app used throughout the pandemic by employees to attest to their lack of COVID symptoms before coming to work \u2014 crashed because so many employees were trying to schedule appointments simultaneously on the day before the vaccinations were set to begin.When the system came back online the next day, employees at various hospitals within the network were allowed to sign up at different time slots. Yet employees were upset that communication regarding the new rolling sign-up system, as well as the windows to sign-up, were sent out when many night shift workers were asleep and many of those on duty could not easily access their phones. They said the result was that many of them missed the short window when appointments were available. For example, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital sent out a communication regarding the new system at 8:46 a.m. Thursday, and their window for sign-up began at 3 p.m. that day. At 3:10pm, an email was sent saying there were \u201cno more vaccine appointments available via online scheduling at this time.\u201d \u201cIt absolutely did create a frenzy, which is the opposite of what we want to do with this system,\u201d acknowledged Biddinger. He said hospital leaders are working on a new system that will address these scheduling problems and that they are running the proposed solutions past those who have reached out with concerns. Even for the staff members who were awake and available during the sign-up window, there was concern regarding a system that was described in internal emails as one in which healthcare personnel \u201cself-police.\u201d The idea was to rely on the \u201cpersonal integrity\u201d of employees in prioritizing those most at risk.Emily Moin, a doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital \u2014 part of the Mass General Brigham network \u2014 took to Twitter to air her complaint.  \u201cA first-come first-serve scramble for vaccination appointments explicitly disadvantages people who work more,\" she wrote. \"This isn't sour grapes that I didn't get as \u2018lucky\u2019 as my colleagues who were able to get vaccinated.\u201d \u201cThis was entirely predictable,\" she wrote. \"This system was doomed to fail and designed \u2014 whether by ignorance or incompetence \u2014 to exacerbate inequities in our system. But it's being touted as a success because people are still getting vaccinated.\u201d A physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital who asked not to be identified for fear of retribution described not getting an appointment online and, after a shift caring for COVID patients, walking to the vaccine clinic and convincing a person giving the vaccines to give them a shot. This doctor reported watching as others were vaccinated, including surgeons who typically only see patients after they\u2019ve received a negative COVID test.Biddinger said the honor code system was necessary. \u201cIt's actually relatively complex to figure out who is working where because of the complexity of an academic medical center. We have staff who move among our hospitals and work in different roles in different hospitals,\u201d he said.He said leaders are aware of concerns that those who should not have been in the first wave signed up anyway. He said they are reviewing data to determine how often this actually happened and that some staff members contacted his office to apologize for signing up too early and said they had misunderstood the system. Going forward, he said, there will be clearer questions to help employees determine their most appropriate wave. Concerns about how hospitals have distributed vaccines have surfaced elsewhere in the country. In California, medical residents \u2014 doctors who recently graduated from medical school \u2014 at Stanford Medicine were not initially included in the algorithm to allocate vaccines. After residents protested, Stanford apologized and reversed course. Mass General Brigham expects to receive more doses of the vaccine this week. It anticipates vaccinating all eligible medical personal within about eight weeks. ",

      "body": "I first learned of Dr. Kizzmekia \u201cKizzy\u201d Corbett back in October during Massachusetts STEM Week. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math, and this year\u2019s theme was \u201cSee Yourself in STEM\u201d \u2014 a message aimed at young women, especially those from marginalized communities, to inspire their curiosity and interest in this growing field. In preparation for my radio conversation with some of these young women, I searched for success stories of women of color in STEM. I was so excited to discover that Corbett, a 34-year-old viral immunologist, is the co-team leader of the vaccine scientists\u2019 group at the National Institutes of Health. Corbett, who is African American, worked closely with Cambridge-based biotech company Moderna, which adapted a vaccine concept she developed at NIH. Her role in the vaccine development is now more important than ever as public health officials like her NIH colleague Dr. Anthony Fauci try to allay fears and dismiss conspiracies among the so-called vaccine reticent \u2014 those Americans who are not sure that they trust the COVID vaccines to be safe and effective. And many of the nearly half of Americans who say they will not take the vaccine are people of color skeptical because of this country\u2019s history of medical racism. Of that history, the Tuskegee Study, which began in 1932, is etched in the psyche of Black Americans. They know the story of how Black men with syphilis were deliberately only given placebos or aspirin for the virulent disease so the public health doctors could monitor the resulting blindness and insanity. But current-day medical racism is embedded in the negative assumptions of health care professionals about the pain level or symptoms of patients of color. Even wealthy African Americans can\u2019t escape it \u2014 like tennis superstar Serena Williams, who almost died in childbirth because she couldn\u2019t initially convince medical staff that something was wrong. And medical racism has played a major role during the COVID crisis. University of Virginia\u2019s emergency room physician, Leigh-Ann Webb, led a survey of patients who arrived at the hospital\u2019s emergency room to be tested for COVID-19. Webb told CBS News doctors were \"disproportionately ordering more tests for people who were white, despite the fact that it was the people of color disproportionally affected.\" Boston City Council President Kim Janey recently told GBH News the years of distrust can\u2019t be ignored, saying, \u201cWe cannot sweep that under the rug and think people are just going to roll up their sleeves and take this vaccine.\u201d But now, in a full-circle moment, Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett\u2019s key contribution in designing the vaccine can help persuade so many rightly skeptical people of color that this medicine is safe. Fauci has delighted in underscoring the importance of Corbett\u2019s work, saying, \u201cThe vaccine that you\u2019re going to be taking was developed by an African American woman, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d It\u2019s a powerful antidote to the legacy of the Tuskegee Experiment.I watched with hope and anticipation last Monday as Long Island nurse Sandra Lindsay, who is also Black, became the very first American to get the vaccine. This vaccine is the first strike against a shapeshifting viral invader which has infected more than 16 million Americans and taken the lives of more than 300,000. I\u2019ll be taking the vaccine, because I want this historic horror to stop. Here\u2019s hoping 300 million of my fellow Americans agree that this shot in the arm is worth it.",

      "body": "I hate snow. Which means I most especially hate this week of the year. The week winter begins. It means snow could come. Or, G*d help us, snow is already here. I know, bah humbug. Still ...I did like it once. Laughed my way through an eight-foot snowstorm years ago in Boston. But I was young. Now ... not so much. Although every time I look at this painting it takes me back to those happy Boston snow days.Frederick Childe Hassam (he never used the Frederick; a friend told him Childe was \"more exotic\") was born in Boston, and early on, began painting cityscapes. At Dusk (Boston Common at Twilight) was his first. I visit the picture every time I'm at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and a postcard of it is taped up next to my bed. It exactly captures how I felt in the three winters I spent there. Cold. A little melancholy at sundown. But mostly content, loving the crisp air, the charming old buildings, the smell of the park. And the pink twilight.Museum of Fine Arts curator Erica Hirshler says in 1885 Hassam was painting modern Boston \u2014 new buildings lining the left side of the street, electric street lamps (not gas). \"And the fact that the woman is walking unchaperoned in the city reflects a different way that women interacted in an urban environment.\" She and the little girls all carry muffs to keep their hands warm. Except for the muffs, and a few other details, the place looks just the same today.Hassam was an American Impressionist. Camille Pissarro was a Danish-French one, who influenced Paul Gauguin and painted with Paul Cezanne. His gorgeous snowy scene looks like iced lace.Pissarro's snow barely has any white in it. If you look closely you'll see blues, pinks, yellows. Curator Hirshler points out, \"each separate color remains distinct, but blends to say 'snow.'\"All these pictures are in the MFA's collection (the museum just closed again; pandemic). They know their snow in Boston. And they introduced me to a Norwegian artist who not only knew snow, but had some truly original perspectives on it.Look how that snowy hill just spills toward us. It takes up three-quarters of the painting. Frits Thaulow puts the horizon line almost at the top of his canvas. Very modern. You don't see much of anything but the snow and its shadows (and again, so many colors in this snow \u2014 the shadow is almost lavender). This fellow Thaulow makes a world in his snow. There weren't any ski lifts in the 19th century. That's why he paints those footprints, going up the hill.Thaulow had some very nice connections. Gauguin was his brother-in-law, Edvard Munch his cousin, Claude Monet a good friend. He got Monet to go to Norway so they could paint snowy scenes together. Thaulow also used pastels. A really difficult medium \u2014 you can't correct something in pastel the way you can in oil paint \u2014 can't just scrape it off. Pastel smudges, is fragile, but stays where it's put for the long haul. An artist has to know what he/she is doing to use it well. Thaulow knew.\"Pastel is really colored dust,\" Hirshler says. \"This scene of snow blowing off the roof in a storm is a perfect synthesis of subject and medium. The snow looks like powder. So does pastel. You can see how good he was to make that very light white drift across the barn's red side,\" she goes on. \"You can feel the wind. It feels cold.\"For me, the perfect way to experience snow is to see it hanging on the wall of a great museum! Erica Hirshler would agree, but she has New England in her blood, so enjoys cold and snow, \"when I have dry feet.\" She cherishes memories of trudging through deep snows in sunshine under deep blue skies. \"It's just like walking through diamonds.\"Time to warm up.A member of Mary Cassatt's family gave the Museum this tea service. Cassatt painted or drew it more than once. Its most intriguing appearance is this one:Cosy little scene, no? No. Odd, in some ways. \"The tea service is almost a third character in the painting,\" says curator Hirshler. \"It's almost as big as the two women.\" And what about the women? The hat-and-glove one is visiting (love the raised pinky!). She's looking away from her hostess \u2014 uneasy? something unpleasant came up? Sipping tea (so her face is covered). Maybe Cassatt had trouble with lips? Remember John Singer Sargent, \"A portrait is a painting with something wrong with the mouth\"? And the hostess also looks away \u2014 thinking? bored? \"Makes you wonder if their relationship is cooler than the tea,\" says Hirshler.Tea's over. Once more into the real winter breach. To prepare ourselves, it will help to take a look at this video. The bravest (or most foolhardy) activity you'll see in a really long time.Eat your hearts out, Florida. Happy winter, everyone!Art Where You're At is an informal series showcasing offerings at museums closed due to COVID-19, or at museums you may not be able to visit. Copyright 2020 NPR.

      "body": "As the United States approaches another major holiday week amid a surge in coronavirus cases, health officials and government leaders are once again warning residents to avoid large indoor gatherings. Dr. Joshua Barocas, Infectious Diseases physician and addiction researcher at Boston Medical Center, joined Joe Mathieu on GBH's Morning Edition today to discuss why the idea of \u2018harm reduction\u2019 may be the best approach to weathering the holiday season.According to Dr. Barocas, the basic concept of harm reduction is acknowledging that people are probably going to engage in risky behaviors regardless of official recommendations, so it\u2019s best to focus on reducing damage and treating people with empathy. \u201cWhat I want to get across is, the idea that when abstinence is the only possible outcome, even the slightest slip-up means you failed \u2014 and we don\u2019t want people to feel that way,\" Dr. Barocas said. WATCH: Dr. Barocas on the concept of harm reductionRaw HtmlWhen it comes to COVID and Christmas, harm reduction means acknowledging that not all activities that are discouraged from public health officials are created equal. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to say, \u2018I can\u2019t do all of that so I\u2019m not going to do any of it,\u2019\u201d Dr. Barocas said. \u201cIf we only have so much capacity, instead of saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to clean my surfaces every single day and never miss a spot,\u2019 maybe we can conserve our energy to say, \u2018I\u2018m going to wear that mask or not gather indoors with people.\u2019\u201d Dr. Barocas said that harm reduction comes from the medical approach to addiction, which originated in the 1980s among drug users, and is the basis for public health programs like needle exchanges. \u201cIt\u2019s Important in our messaging to avoid shaming and blaming people,\u201d Dr. Barocas said. \u201cAll that does is drive that behavior underground. We understand this has been a long, isolating year.\u201d",

      "body": "If we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll never encounter another time as awful as 2020. A raging pandemic, economic collapse, white racism in the face of a long-overdue reckoning with racial justice and an authoritarian-minded president who is still plotting to overturn his decisive defeat have all conspired to make this a year to put behind us.Then there were the personal tragedies. \u201cI remember that first Thanksgiving, the empty chair,\u201d said President-elect Joe Biden, a man who knows tragedy in his bones and in his soul. The lost job. The lost business. The lost hope.During the past year, I've tried to capture some of that \u2014 the lows as well as a few reasons for optimism. Below are 10 of my GBH News columns. They\u2019re in chronological order, starting with the world we lost and ending with a glimpse of better days to come.\u2022 The strangling of local radio, Jan. 21. The New Year had barely begun when we learned that iHeartMedia, a conglomerate that owns some 850 stations, was gutting its properties. Among them: Boston\u2019s venerable WBZ (AM 1030), the city\u2019s last remaining commercial news station, which laid off several longtime journalists. For-profit radio has been sliding downhill since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which effectively removed caps on how many stations a company can own. As with newspapers, a few giant corporations took on massive amounts of debt to build empires, slashing costs so they could pay their creditors. Employees and listeners were the losers.\u2022 The last normal week, March 4. I spent Super Tuesday in Ukiah, California, covering a packed event in a bar (imagine that) hosted by The Mendocino Voice, a small website that was transitioning from for-profit to cooperative ownership. \u201cWe are going to be owned by our readers and our staff,\u201d publisher Kate Maxwell told those on hand. \u201cWe think that\u2019s the best way to be sustainable and locally owned.\u201d By the end of the week, I found myself accompanying Maxwell and managing editor Adrian Fernandez Baumann to Mendocino County\u2019s first news conference about what was then called \u201cthe novel coronavirus.\u201d A day later I returned home on a half-empty flight wondering what was coming next.\u2022 A campus empties out, March 17. Northeastern University, where I\u2019m a journalism professor, takes its spring break the first week of March. Despite the increasingly ominous news, we actually resumed classes the following week. All of us, though, had the sense that a shutdown was imminent \u2014 and it was, as we all had to scramble quickly to move our classes online. This fall, like most of my colleagues, I taught partly in person, partly online, getting tested twice a week. And I am filled with gratitude every day to be one of the lucky few who is still employed and working in a relatively safe environment.\u2022 Fox News endangers lives, April 22. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s cable news station has become a dangerous behemoth, promulgating all manner of misinformation and disinformation about climate change, Hillary Clinton and the awesome wonderfulness of President Donald Trump. Never, though, was Fox News more of a menace than it was in the spring of 2020, when prime-time hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham promoted the toxic idea that COVID-19 (it finally had a name) was a \u201choax.\u201d They disdained mask-wearing and cheered on the armed right-wingers who protested the shutdown, falsely claiming that COVID was nothing to worry about. \u201cThe question is why are our leaders hurting us on purpose,\u201d Carlson told his viewers. \u201cAnd the answer is: Because they can.\u201d\u2022 Avoiding a 2016 repeat, May 27. With Biden having vanquished his Democratic primary opponents and building a solid polling lead over Trump, I asked whether the media could avoid the mistakes they made in 2016 \u2014 obsessing over Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and elevating her minor transgressions so that they appeared to be as serious as Trump\u2019s. In fact, the media appeared to have learned some lessons. Sexual assault charges brought against Biden by Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer, and, later in the year, Rudy Giuliani\u2019s attempts to make some sort of criminal connection between Biden and his son Hunter\u2019s dealings in Ukraine were both quickly dismissed as lacking any evidence. The next question: How will the press cover the Biden presidency?\u2022 A newspaper laid low by racism, June 17. Alexis Johnson, a young Black reporter for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, had been covering the Black Lives Matter protests that broke out following the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others. Then she tweeted out a humorous but pointed observation comparing the damage caused by looters to the mess left behind by tailgaters at a Kenny Chesney concert. She was taken off the protest beat for supposedly failing to maintain her objectivity \u2014 a ludicrous overreaction met with protests by her fellow journalists and the community. Before long, Johnson had left for Vice News and the Post-Gazette had a new executive editor: Stan Wischnowski, who\u2019d just left as executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer after he approved an insensitive \u201cBuildings Matter, Too\u201d headline. Wischnowski was actually an upgrade over his predecessor, Keith Burris, who continues to run the editorial pages. But he was hardly the sort of change that was called for under the circumstances.\u2022 In the dark on Beacon Hill, July 16. Massachusetts is just one of four states whose legislatures are exempt from public-records laws. Cities, towns, counties and state executive agencies must turn over payroll records, contracts, internal communications and other documents when asked to do so by journalists or ordinary citizens. But not the Legislature. \u201cThe Legislature has no interest in changing the status quo,\u201d said Robert Ambrogi, executive director of the Massachusetts Newspaper Publishers Association. And so it remains. In the fall, Northeastern journalism students asked every legislative candidate whether they favored ending the exemption. Most of those who answered said they did \u2014 but only 71 of the 257 candidates bothered to respond despite repeated email and phone requests.\u2022 Local news, saner views, Nov. 11. With the election over and the Trump era drawing to an end, I explored the idea of whether a renewed focus on community life could help overcome the hyperpolarization that has ripped the culture apart at the national level. Before that can happen, though, we need to find ways to revive local journalism. One modest solution would be to create a special state commission to study the problem in Massachusetts and make some recommendations. As 2020 draws to a close, the legislation that would create that commission remains in limbo.\u2022 Linda Henry takes charge, Nov. 18. Some five months after Vinay Mehra exited as president of Boston Globe Media Partners, managing director Linda Pizzuti Henry got a title enhancement: she was named chief executive of the company, which comprises The Boston Globe, Stat News and Boston.com. Although the COVID-related advertising meltdown hurt the Globe as it did every other media company, 2020 turned out to be a good year for owners John and Linda Henry. The Globe\u2019s paid digital circulation passed the long-sought 200,000 mark, and Stat News emerged as a national leader on COVID coverage. Moreover, the company employs about 300 full-time journalists across its three platforms \u2014 a far higher number than would be expected under chain ownership. That said, the company continues its unseemly battle against its union employees, a situation that should have been resolved long ago.\u2022 Back to a better future, Dec. 2. Are there reasons to be optimistic? We all hope so. President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will restore civility to the White House. A COVID vaccine has brought the end of the pandemic within sight. But what about beyond that? In a new book, \u201cThe Upswing,\u201d Robert D. Putnam and Shaylyn Romney Garrett argue that the selfishness that led to the original Gilded Age eventually gave way to the Progressive Era, the New Deal and the Civil Rights Movement \u2014 and that it can happen again.We are entering what is likely to be a devastating winter \u2014 what Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, predicted could be \u201cthe most difficult in the public health history of this nation.\u201d We need to take care of each other and get beyond the sickness and fear that have come to dominate our lives. And we have to tell ourselves that things will get better \u2014 and work to make it come true. What alternative do we have?Finally, my thanks to GBH News for the privilege of having this platform and to you for reading. Best wishes to everyone for a great 2021.GBH News contributor Dan Kennedy\u2019s blog, Media Nation, is online at dankennedy.net.",

      "body": "Faith leaders who have pushed for passage of police reform legislation believe the bill could resurface in the Senate soon, after Gov. Charlie Baker returned it with amendments on Dec. 10.The Greater Boston Interfaith Organization said in a Monday email that the Senate will \"soon be releasing\" a bill addressing Baker's amendments, predicting it could come up for a vote today. The bill was not listed on a tentative agenda published for Monday's Senate session. In a Sunday email to representatives, Whitney Ferguson, an aide to Speaker Robert DeLeo, said the House would \"immediately take action on police reform\" once it receives a bill from the Senate - the House plans formal sessions Tuesday and Wednesday.Baker threatened a veto if lawmakers do not agree to his amendments, and with the legislative session ending on Jan. 5, lawmakers have a shrinking window to act on this and other major issues.Advocates continue to press for passage of policing bill, which Beacon Hill leaders hoped to passed in the summer but have let drift into the winter.Groups including the Essex County Community Organization and Massachusetts Communities Action Network on Saturday held vigils outside Senate President Karen Spilka and DeLeo's homes, then traveled in caravans to a Swampscott church near Baker's house.The online outlet The Appeal on Friday published bodycam video showing Boston police officers responding to protests earlier this year over the killing of George Floyd.The Appeal described the videos as depicting \"police officers bragging about attacking protesters, targeting nonviolent demonstrators for violence and possible arrest, discussing arrest quotas and the use of cars as weapons, and multiple instances of excessive force and liberal use of pepper spray.\"\"The body camera footage we\u2019ve seen so far is disturbing and inexcusable. We need a full investigation into what happened that night to hold accountable anyone who acted unlawfully,\" Attorney General Maura Healey tweeted late Friday night.Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley shared the video on Twitter, encouraging her followers to \"Take action & tell the state house to reject Baker's amendments to water down the most basic reforms.\"",

Karen Spilka and House Speaker Robert DeLeo, both Democrats, as well as the home of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker in Swampscott. Demonstrators held signs and sang holiday carols, some with modified lyrics urging racial equality. \"I thought it was great,\u201d Price said of the event. \u201cWho would be upset about some loving people shedding light, spreading light and singing Christmas hymns? What a beautiful approach to trying to advocate for some extremely important legislation.\u201dEarlier this month, Baker declined to sign the long-awaited police reform bill, instead sending it back to the State House with additional ammendments.

      "body": "The police accountability bill pending in the Massachusetts State House is far from perfect, but for mentally ill victims of police brutality and their families, it is a crucial first step in the right direction.I know because my cognitively disabled sister Amy was a victim of police brutality. Seven years ago, cashiers at a wholesale warehouse in suburban St. Louis falsely accused her of shoplifting. She became agitated by the accusations. They summoned local police, who then tased her in front of our mother, while my mom calmly begged them to remember their training and deescalate. Looking back, it's sheer luck that those officers didn't kill Amy out of fear. It\u2019s a horrific moment that no parent should have to endure, especially a Black parent. It was a difficult story for me to hear on the phone, far away in Boston. No one wants to be the next hashtag, the latest grim and fleeting marker of police violence.Three years later here in the South End, Hope Coleman would face a similar tragedy when Boston Police officers fatally shot her mentally ill son, Terrence Coleman, 31, in front of their apartment after a 911 call about his well-being went terribly wrong.In the aftermath of George Floyd, state legislatures across the country are taking a hard look at policing. As final action on the Massachusetts bill unfolds on Beacon Hill and Gov. Charlie Baker gets a second chance to sign it, it\u2019s worth highlighting what\u2019s good in the legislation, even if it falls short of reformers\u2019 goals.First, the bill would ban chokeholds and emphasize de-escalating the use of force unless it is absolutely necessary. Second, it would compel officers to intervene when other officers are using excessive force against suspects \u2014 a legal duty that could have saved the lives of Floyd in Minneapolis and Eric Garner in New York City, for example. Third, it provides for implicit bias training and teaching officers how to safely interact with the mentally ill. Taken together, those directives could go a long way in preventing deadly outcomes with the police. According to The Washington Post\u2019s national database of police shootings, 23% of people shot and killed by police since 2015 were mentally ill.The bill does have its shortcomings. It calls for a study on replacing police officers with mental health professionals to deal with certain nonviolent 911 calls instead of putting that into practice right away. There\u2019s overwhelming evidence to implement that change now instead of commissioning yet another study. The Treatment Advocacy Center determined five years ago that the mentally ill account for one out of every 10 calls to police nationwide and are 16 times more likely to be shot and killed by police. Why should Beacon Hill waste taxpayers\u2019 money to redo the same report? It\u2019s an approach worth taking, even if only testing it out in a pilot program across the Commonwealth.Worse, the bill doesn\u2019t eliminate qualified immunity for officers when victims of excessive force sue. The bill does, however, strip qualified immunity from cops who have been decertified by a state commission on police officer standards and training. Removing the entire blanket of qualified immunity would be the single biggest deterrent to police brutality, since officers could no longer hide behind their badges and could be held liable for abuse.In Amy\u2019s case, officers escorted her to the hospital after they tased her and left her handcuffed to a hospital bed while nurses removed the taser needles from her back. While the officers were apologetic to my mother for how they mistreated my sister, qualified immunity denied us from holding them truly accountable for their actions in court. U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley and Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins both support ending qualified immunity in the state. Pressley has also proposed a bill to end qualified immunity nationwide.Fortunately, cities across the country are finally making the police treat the mentally ill with dignity and respect. Last summer, Denver deployed social workers instead of police to deal with nonviolent calls. So far, 450 calls have been handled without armed cops. This fall, New York City spent $37 million to create a new mental health unit to deal with nonviolent emergencies and paired social workers with patrolmen on 911 calls. Last summer in Boston, City Councilors Michelle Wu, Lydia Edwards and Julia Mejia proposed an ordinance directing mental health professionals to respond to nonviolent 911 calls instead of Boston Police. The council also voted last week to approve a new civilian police oversight board with subpoena powers, a move for accountability that goes further than the state bill.Regrettably, Baker initially declined to sign that bill, heeding police unions, which are fighting the reform measures tooth and nail. But the need for change became impossible to ignore last Friday when The Appeal published bodycam footage of BPD officers running amok on George Floyd protestors last May. The videos exposed our worst fears about police misconduct: arresting peaceful protestors to meet quotas, brandishing stolen merchandise and bragging about ramming protestors with their cruisers, as if they were playing a live-action version of Grand Theft Auto: Downtown Crossing.These appalling videos are the latest chapter in America\u2019s long history of police brutality. It's been 29 years since Rodney King, 6 years since Ferguson, and 7 months since #GeorgeFloyd. Massachusetts doesn\u2019t need another study or bodycam video to know that policing is broken. When will Baker find the courage to take the first step and sign the reform bill? For Amy and the rest of us, we can\u2019t afford to wait.",

      "body": "Facing the threat of Gov. Charlie Baker's veto, the Massachusetts Senate approved modifications to a landmark police reform bill Monday. The House will take it up Tuesday.The sticking point had been proposed restrictions on police use of facial recognition technology. The modified bill would tighten the existing guidelines for use of the technology. Attorney General Maura Healey, who had opposed limits to law enforcement officers' use of facial recognition, told Boston Public Radio on Tuesday that \"the important thing is we're going to get a police reform bill signed and on the books, and that is a really good thing.\"The legislature had sent a bill to Baker's desk that would have required police to get a warrant to access the Registry of Motor Vehicles' facial recognition software, unless there was an imminent threat. That was prompted by concerns over racial bias in many facial recognition programs.The modified bill no longer requires a warrant, though it does require a written request.Healey, the top law enforcement officer in the state, acknowledged the limitations of facial recognition software, but she said there are ways to ensure \"appropriate processes\" are built into its continued use among police officers.\"We absolutely need to have facial recognition,\" she said, noting it is not the only tool officers use to identify people.\"It's part of any number of investigatory measures. While the technology has been studied and there have been studies that show it does not have the same precision for Black, brown and Asian faces, that has to be accounted for,\" she said. \"We need to improve the technology. But I don't think you abandon the technology.\"In her support of the compromise bill, Healey cited the proposals that made it past Baker's pen, like a commission to certify police officers, set use of force regulations, ban chokeholds and impose a duty on officers to intervene if they see fellow officers do wrong.The Senate has also approved changes sought by Baker regarding no-knock warrants. Initially, the legislature prohibited no-knock warrants where a child or person over 65 years old is present.Healey maintained these are rarely used and necessary for certain law enforcement operations.\"There are situations that necessitate that \u2014 if you have a hostage situation, kidnapping, we've got cases involving child sexual exploitation,\" she said. \"We have these cases, and we need to be able to get in and do the work.\"Healey also told Boston Public Radio that she will ask the federal Department of Homeland Security to terminate its partnership with the Bristol County Sheriff's office after a violent altercation between deputies and immigration detainees in May. Healey's office investigated the department's response and recently determined it violated the detainees' civil rights.\"I will take whatever action necessary to see that happens,\" she said.",

      "body": "Legal Sea Foods has become almost as synonymous with \"New England\" as the lobsters they serve \u2014 so the Massachusetts restaurant chain made headlines this week when it announced its sale to Medford-based PPX Hospitality Group, which also owns Smith & Wollensky and three Strega locations. Legal Sea Foods CEO Roger Berkowitz joined Joe Mathieu on GBH's Morning Edition to discuss the sale, and how the pandemic has impacted the restaurant industry.\"You know, life throws curveballs at you. It's really unpredictable,\" Berkowitz said of the sale, which comes just a year after the restaraunt chain had expanded its high-end seafood offerings. \"What I've learned over the years [is] you always have to have I guess a plan B in place, or options in terms of what you do. If you're too myopic, you leave yourself open to things you can't recover from.\"Part of being a successful entrepreneur, according to Berkowitz, is always thinking ahead to what might come next \u2014 and, when possible, creating multiple plans for multiple outcomes. \"You always have to be thinking ahead and anticipating what could or what might happen, both good and bad,\" he said.WATCH: Berkowitz on how his family got into the food and grocery businessRaw HtmlEven after the sale, Berkowitz is not retiring from Legal Sea Foods; rather, he will return to his retail roots by overseeing the brand's online operations, an undertaking he began years ago when the company first started experimenting with e-commerce. \"We called it 'mail order' back then, or 'catalogue sales,'\" he said. At the time, Legal Sea Foods' e-commerce business focused on orders for seasonal gatherings and special occassions \u2014 think, ordering lobster for an anniversary or shrimp for a birthday party \u2014 but Berkowitz and his colleagues saw the potential for expanding online offerings for \"more everyday kinds of scenarios.\" Those scenarios presented themselves pretty quickly as the pandemic unfolded, slowing down or shuttering the usual channels for seafood distribution: retail grocery stores and, of course, restaurants. According to Berkowitz, before the pandemic, \"60 to 70 percent of seafood, the great seafood, was always served in restaurants.\" \"Herein lies the opportunity,\" Berkowitz said. \"Why don't we take our expertise, we'll have some of the recipes that we've developed over the years, and put it into a different channel, if you will. I think there was always a growth potential for that, but what happened with the pandemic \u2014 and people not going out or not having enough confidence to go into restaurants at this point \u2014 this became sort of a perfect venue for us to expand what we've always wanted to do.\"When asked about the fate of the restaurant industry post-pandemic \u2014 especially after a challenging winter ahead, with major surges in the coronavirus across the country and limited options for outdoor dining \u2014 Berkowitz said, \"That's a very good question, and that's really an unknown question at this point. Look, I'm going to assume there's always going to be a need for restaurants. Will there be a need for as many restaurants? What kind of restaurants?\"WATCH: Berkowitz on the challenges of the restaurant business model, pre- and post-pandemicRaw HtmlWhile maintaining business as usual amid standard costs and less revenue is not an option for most restaurateurs, Berkowitz noted a few potential options: sit out the pandemic, and then look to grow by expanding to more locations or additional offerings, or cut down on costs by closing some locations and focusing on a smaller operation. For mom-and-pop establishments, where it's typically easier to control expenses, Berkowitz suggested going the take-out route to stay afloat until the pandemic subsides.And when, exactly, will that be? \"Is [the restaurant industry] coming back in nine months? Is it coming back in a year? No one really knows that right now, and so that's really the difficulty that restaurants have right now. If they could see the end of the tunnel, then they could plan accordingly. But no one can plan during this pandemic.\"",

      "body": "Robert A. DeLeo, speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, will step down effective Tuesday at 6 p.m. In nearly 12 years at the top of Beacon Hill, Winthrop's DeLeo has survived two governors, four senate presidents, four top budget lieutenants and three U.S. attorneys. He's chaperoned over a decade's worth of incremental liberal policy-making while pleasing employers, irritating the left and avoiding the corruption that ensnared his most recent predecessors.As he departs the speakership for a job at his alma mater, Northeastern University, here are some of the issues that have shaped DeLeo's legacy as the longest serving speaker in state history.TRANSPORTATIONOne of the first monumental exercises of the House's power under DeLeo was the gutting of Gov. Deval Patrick's $3 billion plan to invest in transportation infrastructure. The House instead settled on a more moderate plan in 2009. The final version, backed by Senate President Therese Murray, reorganized the state's transportation bureaucracy. Lawmakers then raised the gas tax by three cents in 2013. But voters rejected the idea of automatic increases tied to inflation, leaving the state's transportation systems underfunded through the crippling 2015 snow storms and beyond. Earlier this year, DeLeo put forward a gas tax hike plan to address the decades-old infrastructure woes, but this time he didn't have Senate backing. CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND POLICEMuch as transportation has been a topic that bookended DeLeo's tenure, the movement to reform the state's criminal justice system has been a common thread throughout the last decade. Lawmakers took their biggest swing at addressing the \"back end\" of the court and corrections system in 2018 by removing most mandatory minimum drug sentences, allowing minors to expunge some criminal charges and adding restrictions to harsh prison policies. In 2020, the reformers' energy went to the \"front end\" of the problem: oversight of how police exercise their authority over citizens and how they are held accountable. DeLeo will leave with a major police accountability bill on the goal line. Most expect it to become law now that a compromise has been struck with Gov. Charlie Baker.TAXES AND SPENDINGDeLeo has developed a reputation in left-leaning circles, fair or not depending who you ask, for opposing raising revenue from the broad public or from employers. Along with the modest gas tax increase, early on DeLeo oversaw the 2009 sales tax increase from 5%t to 6.25% \u2014 a 25% increase that still stands.Since then, government spending has increased 53.7%, from $32.4 billion in fiscal year 2010 to $49.8 billion this fiscal year, with tax revenue and federal aid balancing out the budget each year. Over the same time period since the Great Recession, billions have been put away in the state's rainy day fund that budget writers are now relying on to maintain state services during the pandemic.DeLeo has supported the so-called \"millionaires tax,\" a 4% surtax on incomes over $1 million, as the proposal made its way through the Legislature's constitutional conventions, headed to voters for an eventual vote at the ballot.GUNSOne of DeLeo's biggest policy pursuits has been increasing gun control in Massachusetts and maintaining the state's position as one of the most regulated in the nation. After the Sandy Hook shooting, DeLeo commissioned the 2014 report on gun violence that lead to the state's groundbreaking law later that year giving local police the authority to regulate weapons in their jurisdiction, added criminal and mental health background checks and established for the first time a \"red flag\" provision where a third party could request a weapon be removed from a legal gun owner. Subsequent mass shootings in the U.S. lead to further reforms: a ban on bump stocks and an expansion of the \"red flag\" law allowing courts to confiscate legal weapons, both in 2018.PATRONAGEThe trial of former Probation Commissioner John O'Brien and two other department officials for treating the state's prisoner release system as a jobs racket brought the world of Beacon Hill patronage under the microscope of U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, who had just sent DeLeo's predecessor, Speaker Sal DiMasi, to federal prison for corruption. DeLeo was one of several lawmakers caught up in the case, but he was never charged with anything beyond being labelled an \"unindicted co-conspirator\" in the scheme. Further vindication for DeLeo came when an appeals court overturned the convictions of O'Brien and his co-defendants and called the prosecution overzealous.CASINOSOne of the first major policy shifts of the DeLeo era came when the new speaker reversed his predecessor DiMasi's opposition to casino gambling, a decision that lead to the resort casinos in Everett and Springfield and the slots parlor in Plainville. The gaming law put in place by DeLeo and Murray began a slow process of establishing the Gaming Commission and drew up an approval process for licensees. It also set up dozens of clashes between casino developers, residents, local government officials and Native American tribes.TRANSGENDER RIGHTSThe battle for equal rights and access to public accommodations for those who identify as trangender was fought in two rounds: The first, in 2012, added protections for transgender people to the state's discrimination laws. The second round came four years later, when advocates, working with DeLeo, managed to push the the final piece of the equality agenda through the House and grant access for transgender people to public accomodations like restaurants, bathrooms, locker rooms and more. That law withstood a challenge from conservatives at the ballot that year, with over two-thirds of voters agreeing to keep the equal access provisions on the books. KEEPING THE HOUSE DOMINANTThroughout his tenure, DeLeo was unwavering in his efforts to keep the House \"more equal\" than Senate. Legislative rules give the 160 members of the House the upper hand over their 40 Senate colleagues when it comes to the flow of legislation and which chamber bills are assigned to \u2014 a power DeLeo exercised in order to keep the House's agenda the Legislature's priority. DeLeo's moderate stances on issues of taxation and spending empowered him even more when  Baker was elected in 2014. With then-Senate President Stan Rosenberg's left-leaning chamber tilting away from the new Republican governor, DeLeo found himself the gatekeeper of the centrist third way that's dominated State House politics ever since.",

      "body": "Most of the commonwealth's homless shelters are already operating at reduced capacity. Now they could be overwhelmed by impending winter weather, the latest surge in COVID-19 cases and a potential wave of evictions, according to shelter operators, advocates and local officials.Many say they are already seeing more people living outside than at any time in recent memory \u2014 whether alone, in small groups of tents on city streets or in larger encampments, often on the fringes of urban centers. Bruce, a man in his late thirties who has been homeless on and off for years, is one such person. Speaking to GBH News at MBTA\u2019s Alewife station, where he was preparing to spend a recent night, Bruce recounted trying to go to the CASPAR emergency shelter in Cambridge and being turned away because the shelter was full.  \u201cThey basically said, 'You might as well try Boston,'\u201d Bruce said.  GBH News couldn\u2019t confirm the details of Bruce's story, but it is hardly unique. In the early days of the pandemic this spring, COVID-19 infections among shelter guests surged to as high as 30% or more. To stem the spread of the virus, shelters \u201cde-populated,\u201d cutting bed capacity by as much as half in some cases. At the time, the loss of capacity was mitigated by various means, including dedicated treatment and isolation space in field hospitals and large outdoor tents in Boston and Worcester, along with the use of hotel rooms and other more ad hoc measures. But most of those measures were temporary. And with winter weather arriving, shelter operators have been clamoring for months for additional emergency capacity. State officials have acted on those calls in recent weeks. Officials for the state's Department of Housing and Community Development say they've secured over 1,000 extra emergency shelter beds statewide. Some cities have stepped up too: Boston officials say they've added more than 200 beds for this winter and are hoping to add over 300 more in the near future. In Cambridge, an overnight \"heating center\" is now open around the clock. Officials in Worcester and Quincy say they're ready to utilize motel rooms if needed.But the question remains whether that added capacity will be sufficient, given extraordinary uncertainty about the needs in this unpredented time.\u201cWe know that there have been encampments growing in an unparalleled fashion here in Massachusetts around all of the various communities, from Pittsfield to the Cape,\u201d said Joe Finn, president and executive director of the Massachusetts Housing and Shelter Alliance. Jim Stewart, who runs the First Church shelter in Cambridge, agrees.\u201cPeople have slept on the subways for 100 years,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBut now you have people \u2026 basically camped on the benches at stations around there, not just overnight but 24 hours.\u201dOther shelter operators and advocates for the homeless describe seeing more people on the street or living in encampments in Brockton, Lowell, Waltham, Brockton, Quincy and Lawrence. The reasons for the apparent trend aren\u2019t clear. Experts who spoke with GBH News speculated that there could be a variety of factors at play, from reduced capacity at overnight shelters to more people becoming homeless from having lost jobs in the pandemic, to legitimate concerns about the risks of exposure to infection inside shelters.It\u2019s also possible that the pandemic itself has simply made people already living outside more visible, said Cassie Hurd, who runs the Material Aid and Advocacy Program in Cambridge and regularly visits people living outdoors. When shelter-at-home orders took effect at the start of the pandemic, \u201cThey were kind of the only people left out on the street,\u201d Hurd pointed out.Visibility, Hurd said, has often meant trouble.   \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s an increase in [police] moving people along, breaking up encampments and sweeping encampments because people are so hyper-visible,\u201d Hurd said.Hurd points to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggesting that with infections still surging, living outdoors may, in fact, be safer than alternatives. The CDC has urged local officials to carefully weigh the risks of displacing people who do so.Dr. Jim O\u2019Connell, president of Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, said that living outdoors carries severe health risks, but that right now, given the potential for transmission of COVID-19 indoors, \u201callowing the encampments to be is probably safer during these immediate times.\"\u201cDoes that mean it's good policy long term? No, not at all,\" he told GBH News. \"But I think these are just extraordinary times, and we probably have to have exceptions.\u201dThose sentiments are echoed by Terri, a woman who had been living in a tent on a plaza with a half dozen or so other people near Boston\u2019s South Station for the past two or three months.  Terri told GBH News she\u2019s been in and out of shelters, and what she really wants is a home. For now, though, she said the encampment felt like the best option and offered her \u201ca community that looks out for each other.\u201d After last week's snowstorm, Terri called to say she and the others had been forced to pack up and leave. She was at South Station, she said, and didn\u2019t know where she was going to go next.",

      "body": "The Celtics are getting back to business only a little over two months after their run in the NBA Bubble in Florida came to an end. Like pretty much everything that\u2019s happened this year, the season will look and feel different because of COVID-19. But after an NBA season that was interrupted in March, had to start back up in quarantine and was disrupted again by a players' strike protesting police brutality, there will be at least a sense of normalcy. But only a little bit.When the Celtics take on the Milwaukee Buck on Dec. 23, it will be their first regular-season home game on the TD Garden parquet since their March 8 game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.The stress of playing in the bubble made it next to impossible for the league to start another season in similar circumstances, but doing so leaves the league open to the exposure problems other leagues like the NFL have faced while playing. Still, head coach Brad Stevens was confident in the league\u2019s safety protocols when he spoke to reporters at the start of training camp. \u201cI think as we saw with the bubble the NBA crosses every T and dots every I,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been great communicating with all of us. \u2026 It\u2019s been a short break in some ways, but this is what we do and this is what we love to do. We\u2019re hopeful that everybody continues to be safe, and we\u2019re able to do this thing right.\u201dThere are only 72 regular-season games scheduled this year, 10 fewer than usual, and only the first-half of the schedule has been released, leaving room for the NBA to reschedule and move around games that may have to be canceled if there are any COVID-19 outbreaks. Players and staff are being tested daily, and the league is keeping strict guidelines on what needs to happen for a player to return after a positive test. There\u2019s even an anonymous tip line the league has set up to report anyone who is violating the protocols. Marcus Smart, who tested positive for COVID-19 in March, told reporters he\u2019s impressed with how the league is handling the return.\u201cYou can definitely tell that they\u2019re taking the approach, \u2018Better safe than sorry,\u2019 and allowing us to get back to doing our job and bringing entertainment to the fans and the people out there,\u201d he told reporters at the start of camp. \u201cSo, I definitely think the approach that the league is taking is a good one, and I like where it\u2019s at.\u201dBut he admitted it\u2019s tougher this year to handle the situation when it\u2019s not in a controlled situation like the bubble. The Celtics\u2019 lost star Gordon Hayward in free agency to the Charlotte Hornets. Point guard Kemba Walker will be out until at least the start of the new year with a nagging injury to his left knee. That leaves more responsibility on the shoulders of Smart, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and newcomers like Tristan Thompson and Jeff Teague.For Tatum, who signed a five-year contract extension with the team reportedly worth up to $195 million, it\u2019s a chance to fully develop into a superstar and becomen the face of the franchise. The Celtics have been in the Eastern Conference finals three of the last four seasons. Their ultimate goal is to make it past that checkpoint and get to the championship \u2014 a goal that\u2019s alluded them for a decade. While this team may have as good a shot as any to do it, just keeping a whole team healthy and COVID-free may be the biggest challenge this year. Everything after that is a reward in itself. ",

Charlie Baker and others.\u201cI know that it\u2019s tempting, and it\u2019s been a difficult year for a lot of people, and you want to bring other folks into your household,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not safe for you, that\u2019s not safe for them, that\u2019s not safe for the people you might come into contact with.\u201d \u201cGetting tested does not protect you from this infection,\u201d he added. \u201cYou cannot test your way in or out of safe traditional gathering this year.\u201dFor some people, Walsh acknowledged, refraining from gatherings with family and friends may be especially difficult as 2020 draws to a close. \u201cMany of you have had to make lots of sacrifices \u2014 sacrifices that you could never imagine this time last year,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be overwhelmed; it\u2019s okay to be tired; it\u2019s okay to be sad. Don\u2019t be afraid to talk to somebody.\u201dIndividuals who feel they need help can speak with a healthcare provider or community organization like the Samaritans, who can be reached at 877-870-4673, Walsh said. They can also call the city\u2019s 311 helpline.\u201cWe have the ability to connect you to resources,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI think that you need to take that opportunity if that\u2019s the case.\u201dThe mayor also reminded the public that the city is currently in a modified version of phase II, step 2 of reopening, with museums, movie theaters and gyms closed until at least Jan. 6. Boston\u2019s community positivity rate has risen to 8.8%, up from 7.2% last week, Walsh said. In response to a reporter\u2019s question, Walsh said he doesn\u2019t know if the Boston Police Department is currently investigating troubling comments \u2014 revealed last week by The Appeal \u2014 made by officers during a racial-justice protest on May 31 and June 1.\u201cThere could be investigations going on right now,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI have not had that conversation with the commissioner.\u201dThe behavior described by The Appeal, in theory, could be investigated by Boston\u2019s new police civilian-review board as well as the department\u2019s internal-affairs unit, Walsh said. The mayor also had a word of warning about holiday weather, saying rain and relatively high temperatures could bring flooding and re-freezing the coming days \u2014 with any still-unshoveled snow exacerbating the situation. \u201cWe\u2019re asking people, as much water as we can get off the street, it\u2019d be great to do that,\u201d Walsh said. Despite the press conference\u2019s muted tone, Walsh struck a guardedly optimistic note as he looked toward 2021. \u201cWe are finally at the point where we feel like we have less days ahead of us of this virus than we do behind us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while we don\u2019t know exactly when this pandemic will end, we do know that there are better days coming.\"",

And not having that is a huge loss. There are a good number of individuals who are feeling grief about that, and that grief itself also contributes to mental health concerns.\"Dr. Leena Mittal, director of the Division of Women\u2019s Mental Health at Brigham and Women's Hospital, says we can help expecting or new mothers by not only checking in on them during the pandemic but also advocating for wider access to mental health services.We also spoke with David Blais, a co-founder of the Framingham food organization Daniel's Table, about the app they are rolling out next year to more efficiently distribute food in their community.Click on the audio player above to listen to the full episode.Segments:David Blais - 3:00Dr. Cindy Liu and Dr. Leena Mittal - 12:02",

      "body": "So sure was Robert DeLeo of House Speaker-to-be Ron Mariano's loyalty that the steely-eyed DeLeo didn't blink when Quincy Democrat Mariano began several years ago to quietly solicit support to succeed the once-called \"Speaker For Life.\"Now the transition is almost complete, with even the co-chairs of the House Progressive Caucus pledged to the 74-year old Mariano. Mariano's ascension takes a chapter from the rules according to DeLeo, the foundation of which is to make sure there is a rock-solid majority in favor of any proposal before scheduling a vote. On rare occasions \u2014 the recent vote on police accountability is an example \u2014 the situation may get close. Still, the result is predictable: The speaker never loses.There is no evidence to suggest Mariano will rewrite that playbook. That means that the House \u2014 rather than the state Senate \u2014 is likely to remain the arbiter of what does and doesn't become Massachusetts law.To most members, Mariano, soon the 86th speaker, promises stability. And in a state that is wracked with coronavirus, a steady hand is a prized commodity.Former Majority Leader Mariano has replicated the broad support from all stripes of Democrats that kept DeLeo in power for nearly 12 years.\"In any institution, you look for experience, and I think he's the most experienced candidate,\" Easton Rep. Claire Cronin, a supporter of Mariano and chairwoman of the House Judiciary Committee, told GBH News when Mariano announced his intention to seek the speakership.DeLeo vacated the Winthrop seat he's held for nearly 30 years for a job at his alma mater, Northeastern University.DeLeo leaves the House just one week before the end of the legislative session, with lawmakers potentially set to take last-minute votes on issues as far ranging as online sports betting, housing production, transportation funding, climate change preparations and more.There will be no honeymoon for Mariano, as work must begin in January on next year's budget plan, which will be difficult to balance because of deteriorating tax revenues and inconsistent aid from the federal government.\"I tend to believe that when you're in a hurricane, you want the old oak tree and not the young one you just planted,\" Cronin said. \"We're going into really stormy, stormy times ahead.\"In a public statement sent the day DeLeo announced his interest in Northeastern, Mariano wrote that members of the House are eager to recover from the pandemic and revive the economy, curb the cost of health care, build housing and transportation infrastructure and address climate change.\"I believe I have earned the trust and confidence of my colleagues and that I have gained their support to lead the House forward,\" Mariano wrote.There are grumbles that Mariano will not be as open to progressive legislation as his predecessor. Progressives from outside the State House are weary that Mariano won't try hard enough to push through the select number of socially progressive bills, such as transgender legislation, that DeLeo was known for.\"It\u2019s extremely telling of the state of the Democratic Party in Massachusetts that the Democrat electeds can\u2019t organize themselves to find a leader who is at least as left-leaning as DeLeo, who set a pretty low bar,\" said Rebecca Pinn, a Democratic State Committee member and secretary of the Young Democrats of America.Speaking to GBH News the day before his elevation, Mariano said he may be more willing to push legislation to the floor than DeLeo had been.\"You try to build a consensus, but at some point you have to put it to the body and let them decide. I think that would be one of the changes you may see or may recognize as being a little bit different.\"Inside the State House, Mariano is seen as a moderate Democrat closely allied with DeLeo. As majority leader, Mariano's voting record was essentially identical to DeLeo's and fully in step with the mainstream of the House.Planned Parenthood of Massachusetts considers Mariano an \"ally\" on its annual scorecard of lawmakers. Other left-wing groups, like Progressive Massachusetts, take a dimmer view. The group gave Mariano a \"D\" ranking for support of their very progressive agenda.The right wing isn't overly fond of Mariano, either. The anti-tax Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance rates him at 2%, a bit lower than the average Democrat and identical to DeLeo's score.Rep. Russell Holmes of Mattapan was the only House member planning to challenge Mariano. But he thought the better of it. Two retiring representatives, Denise Provost of Somerville and Jonathan Hecht of Watertown, were the only other members speaking out against Mariano's elevation. The pair urged fellow House progressives to withhold support from Mariano, who they wrote in CommonWealth is well to the political right of DeLeo.If House progressives \"acquiesce quietly in Mariano\u2019s election, they will be complicit not just in flouting basic democratic norms but also in elevating to the powerful speakership someone whose record shows indifference, if not outright hostility, to progressive values and legislative priorities,\" Provost and Hecht wrote.Former Ways and Means Chairman Jeffrey Sanchez served with Mariano for years and worked closely with him on health care policy. Sanchez called Mariano \"a conductor in the well\" of the House chamber who masterfully negotiates deals on the floor and in the back rooms of the State House.\"The average person doesn't see him, but he has shepherded and ushered in major pieces of legislation that have affected every life in the commonwealth,\" Sanchez told GBH News.Another supporter, Rep. Josh Cutler of Duxbury, said Mariano has been a teacher and mentor in the House by cutting to the core of issues and dealing honestly with members. Mariano has a reputation for plain speaking, which most interviewed seem to appreciate.\"Anytime there's a tough vote or a thorny issue or something I need some guidance on, he's someone that I really look to, and I think a lot of other members look to. He's someone who has a lot of wisdom about these things,\" Cutler said.Even before the speakership vote, there was speculation that the septuagenarian Mariano's term may not last more than a few years, generating speculation of who would become the new \"speaker-in-waiting.\" Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz of the North End, 42, is among the mentioned, as is Easton's Rep. Claire Cronin, who could hold a senior leadership position under Mariano.Pensions often figure in conversations on how long a political leader in Massachusetts will choose to remain in office. DeLeo is leaving with an annual pension estimated to be around $135,000. Mariano would need to serve as speaker, and earn the higher salary that comes with it, for three years to maximize his own annual retirement payout. That would mean reelection as speaker in 2023 and serving until at least the end of that year.",

      "body": "The holiday season is a time many look forward to all year. Usually, it's a time for family gatherings and to practice long-held traditions. But the raging pandemic and crumbling economy have forced people of all ages to make difficult holiday choices, as the traditional season of joy now carries unexpected hardships and considerations. Thomas Briggs can sense it. The 22 year old has sold Christmas trees at Wilson Farm in Lexington for the past six winters. He said he has noticed a depressing trend this season. \"A lot of the older folks we've had were moving down to small trees,\" Briggs said. \"It's sad, but a lot of them didn't have the ability to see their kids or their grandkids and were a little less enthusiastic.\"With millions out of work, money worries abound. At one point this year, Massachusetts had the highest unemployment rate in the country \u2014 more than 16 percent. Christien Simpson of Worcester lost her job as a nurse\u2019s aide this spring. The single mother of two said she\u2019s struggling to cover her kids\u2019 basic needs. \"I feel ashamed,\" Simpson said, \"because they're supposed to depend on me to provide for them.\" With no money for Christmas gifts, Simpson asked for help online. An actress with a major Instagram presence shared Simpson's post, and donations have been pouring in since. Simpson said she\u2019s floored and grateful that strangers stepped up to help.That inspiring community support she's experienced, Simpson said, stands in contrast to how the pandemic aid process has played out in Washington, with President Donald Trump this week threatening to veto the relief package passed by Congress. \"It's been a long, withdrawn thing,\" Simpson said. \"They understand people need help. $600 relief? Thumbs up to them.\"There's also little relief this holiday season for frontline workers, who've been grinding out long days and making sacrifices all year long. Mass General Brigham RN Katelyn Sullivan had already been scheduled to work Christmas Eve when she saw that another shift needed to be filled on Christmas Day. She volunteered to take on the additional hours, even at the expense of time spent with family. \"It was just like my sister or my brother asked me for help,\" Sullivan said. \"I wouldn't think twice.\"Even small, joyful community traditions are on hold.Nearly every December since 1991, Cambridge's Brattle Theatre has screened the Christmas classic \"It's A Wonderful Life.\" Brattle Executive Director Ivy Moylan said she's heartbroken that the theater can't show the film this year, especially given the resonance of the movie's plot, about a town that bands together to help a friend in crisis. \"There are people who are like, 'I see this every year, and every year it makes me cry,'\" said Moylan. \"I think that's beautiful.\"Like so many others this season, Moylan is improvising a way to bring people together. For a donation, the Brattle has been mailing out custom Bingo cards so those streaming the movie at home can track its most iconic moments. And Moylan says she holds out hope that that next year's holidays will be much brighter.  \"The parties that we are going to hold when the Brattle reopens \u2014 I think they're going to last a long time,\" she said.",

      "body": "Police may have instigated some of the violence that followed a Black Lives Matter protest in Boston on May 31, according to body camera footage that emerged this weekend.But the videos also show cases where some protesters clearly tried to incite the police, highlighting the complexity of the event.In the wake of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, thousands of demonstrators representing a vast demographic swatch of ages, races and ethnicities descended on downtown Boston to protest police violence against other Black people across the country. Around 9 p.m., a large gathering on the Boston Common broke up and protestors began making their way home. Evan McDonald, a recent Emerson College graduates, said he and his girlfriend were heading home when police incited violence.\u201cAs we were returning towards Tremont Street, the police basically flanked us all, armed with riot gear,\" McDonald told GBH News. \"And next thing I know, they were firing gas canisters at us.\"The videos show police escalating conflicts with protesters at various points that night. In one scene caught on tape, a group of Black men approach a line of officers and yell at them to \"take a knee,\" the symbolic act of confronting injustice popularized by quarterback Colin Kaepernick. The police weren\u2019t having it, and the next thing seen on the videos is tear gas canisters being thrown in the direction of the 100 or so lingering protestors on Tremont Street. But the videos also show moments where protesters hurled dozens of water bottles, unopened soda cans and trash bins in the direction of police officers. In response to the body camera revelations, Police Commissioner William Gross placed a sergeant who bragged about hitting three protestors with his car on administrative leave. In a statement, Gross said his office is also looking into other abuses shown on the tapes.The body camera footage has also been turned over to Suffolk County D.A. Rachael Rollins\u2019 office, which said it is focusing on \u201ctroubling scenes that merit further examination.\u201d",

      "body": "In the news business, we always hope our stories have an impact, but it's not often our stories lead the governor to create a new state agency to fix a problem we revealed. But that's what the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting achieved in 2020. Editor Paul Singer spoke with GBH's All Things Considered Host Arun Rath to explain what happened. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Arun Rath: So we've talked a few times about the series The Color of Public Money, which has some pretty breathtaking reporting. Why don't you remind us \u2014 take us back to how this got started. Paul Singer: It started with me recruiting the group of BU students \u2014 a bunch of computer science students \u2014 they helped us scrape and analyze a database of government contracts going back about 10 years. And they managed to capture 13,000 contracts where we could identify the company that received the work. So then once we had it, we said, well, how many of these companies are minority-owned businesses? And the answer stunned us. It was fewer than 250. So my colleague Chris Burrell took the story from there. He started talking to black contractors and he spoke, for instance, with one contractor named Calvin Branford, who said minority businesses face a fundamental hurdle getting government contracts. Clip of Calvin Branford: It's not easy at all. I mean, it's it's old boys' network as far as most of the work that goes on. So it's a real challenge, even though the work's out there is very challenging to get it. Singer: And Chris discovered in his reporting that not only were minority firms not getting the government contracts, but the value of contracts they were getting had declined over the past two decades. So in 1998, the state reports spending $359 million. You adjust that for inflation, it's about $550 million. But in 2018, Massachusetts only reported spending $429 million. And that number, it turns out, wasn't true. Rath: Wow. So the state number wasn't wasn't true and you guys did the math to show that wasn't the case? Singer: That state number was not true. They issue these annual reports on how much each agency spends with minority-owned businesses. And it took us months, but we went through these reports and figured out that in 2016, they had changed the way they count with the express intent of boosting their results. So, like, they used to take credit only for direct contracts state agencies signed with minority-owned businesses. Right. Makes sense. After 2016, they started including any payments made by a state contractor to a minority business. So if a white contractor hires a Hispanic window washer for their headquarters office, that counts. If the white contractor had a black caterer for their holiday office party, that counts. And in some cases, the state took the credit, even if white contractors made a donation to a minority-run nonprofit. Rath: Wow. So talk about the impact, how much of an impact that had on the state's numbers? Singer: It was huge. It was, annually, it was as much as 30 percent of the total. So as I said, the $429 million the state claimed in 2018, only about $280 million of that was money that was actually spent by the state. The rest of it was this third-party, funny money. Rath: So let's talk about how this reverberated, because it wasn't a case of the governor reads the story and says, all right, well, we'll fix this. Singer: No, no, it was not. He made a couple of very few public comments where he basically said we were wrong, his administration has been raising the number of minority contracts every year. But he was also coming under enormous pressure from minority business groups and even his own Black Advisory Commission to address the findings. So in February, they first created a new mandate to increase minority participation in state construction contracts. But then in November, the day before the November election, he announced that he's elevating the office that manages minority contracting to a stand alone agency. That gives it a much greater authority to force other agencies to hire businesses of color and to basically get the numbers right. He also at that point announced that they were going to start separating the spending counting between the direct spending by the state and the third-party spending. Rath: Wow. So, I mean, it's just kind of kind of amazing to watch this unfold. So singer at this point, you know, do we retire the jersey of the Color of Public Money? Are you done? Singer: No, we're not done at all. Governors have been saying for decades that they want to do more to expand minority contracting and it still doesn't happen. Right? So we're continuing to dig into the question, why not? Why doesn't it happen? Why, as our colleague Phillip Martin found out, hasn't the Steamship Authority hired a black-owned business in at least five years? Why, as our colleague Kirk Carapella and the education team found out, do universities across the state have an average minority contracting rate of somewhere around two percent? It's not just about government agencies, this is about structural racism. And we are committed to continuing to explore and expose it. That's going to be our theme going into 2021, just like it was in 2020. Rath: Yeah. I mean, I guess the lesson is that creating an agency doesn't necessarily solve a problem. Singer: Absolutely not. You can. You can. Who knows whether they'll actually do what they're supposed to do. That's what we're there for, to make sure they do. ",

      "body": "A day after announcing new business restrictions aimed at preventing a post-Christmas boom of COVID-19 cases, Gov. Charlie Baker said restaurants, retailers and other small businesses hurt by the pandemic will be eligible for grants through a new $668 million small business relief fund operated by the state.Baker said qualifying businesses will be eligible for grants of up to $75,000 or three-months of operating expenses to help pay for salaries, utilities, rent, debt or other expenses.The money to pay for the program will come, in part, from the flexibility the new federal stimulus bill passed this week by Congress will give the state to reallocate existing resources. The governor urged President Donald Trump to sign the bill.Baker on Tuesday announced that beginning on Saturday businesses would have to limit their capacity to 25 percent, further restricting the volume of customers they are able to accommodate at any given time. The rollback on capacity limits, Baker said, will last for at least two weeks and will hopefully be temporary to prevent Christmas gatherings from contributing to an acceleration in the spread of COVID-19 the way Thanksgiving drove new cases.\"We get that these decisions have consequences,\" Baker said.The grants will be administered by the Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation, and businesses who have already applied for a smaller $50 million grant program will not have to reapply. The first grants will be awarded to those who could not be funded in the first round of funding, and a second two-week application window will open on Dec. 31.Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said eligible businesses will include restaurants, bars, caterers, indoor recreation and entertainment venues, gyms and fitness center, event support professionals like photographers, nail salons, barbershops and retailers.This is a developing story.",

      "body": "2020 will likely be remembered as the year of the Pandemic, but the year also marked a sea change in racial justice activism, as Black Lives Matter protests brought calls for police reform from the streets to city halls and state houses across the country \u2013 including Massachusetts.In Georgia in February, an African American, Ahmaud Abery, was shot to death by a white man while jogging; In March, a 26-year-old Black woman, Breonna Taylor, was gunned down in her own home by police executing a warrant for someone else. These cases provoked angry local reactions, but It was not until the killing of an unarmed Black man in Minneapolis caught on video tape that a national wave of protests erupted. The images of Officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee on George Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds reignited the Black Lives Matter Movement that had first emerged in 2013.On Sunday May 31, thousands gathered in downtown Boston and Nubian Square Roxbury, and toward twilight the two protests converged on Beacon Hill.That evening, small groups splintered from the overwhelmingly peaceful marches to confront police, smash windows and litter the streets with graffiti. Some -- including individuals the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s office later found had nothing to do with the protests -- looted shops. \u201cIt was a beautiful demonstration, we had six hours of peace and of course, a lot of people are going to dwell on the negativity that happened after, you know, supposedly it turned into a riot,\u201d said Carrie Mays, a 19-year-old BLM activist from Dorchester. \u201cBut I just want to say that those were not the young people that organized that movement or that march that day.\u201d But violence in the streets was the main headline the next morning as merchants swept glass from the front of stores on Newbury Street and elsewhere. Still, those incidents, did not derail the movement. A few days later, hundreds sat in the streets and blocked traffic on Blue Hill Avenue\u2014 for 8 and a half minutes. And then tens of thousands streamed through Franklin Park to protest police violence. Ian and Carol Ann O\u2019Connell, a white married couple from Jamaica Plain, said they came in spite of the pandemic and concerns about potential violence. \u201cI was fearful to come given the violence of the recent protests, but to me, I felt like that's how black people feel every day from our law enforcement and from society,\u201d Carol Ann said. \u201cSo, I felt selfish to be afraid when that\u2019s something they go through every day.\u201d The protest continued into the night with hundreds descending on Boston Police Headquarters, where some cops took a knee in solidarityThe social justice movement that accelerated during the spring and summer captured the sympathy and imagination of the country. Black Lives Matter signs sprouted in windows and front yards in cities and suburbs, from Lincoln Massachusetts to Lincoln Nebraska. An ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in July showed that 63% of Americans supported the BLM movement. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court released an unprecedented joint letter saying \u201cAs judges we must look afresh at what we are doing or failing to do to root out any conscious or unconscious bias in our courtrooms\u2026. We need to reexamine why, too often, our criminal justice system fails to treat African-Americans the same as white Americans, and recommit ourselves to the systemic change needed to make equality under the law an enduring reality for all.\u201dThe protests also brought new interest in old cases of black people killed by police. Locally, attention turned to two high profile cases: Eurie Stamps, killed in Framingham in 2011 when a SWAT team came to arrest his son and shot Stamps as he lay on the floor; and DJ Henry, a young Easton man shot by police in Pleasantville, N.Y, in 2010 as he was trying to leave a club where there had been a disturbance.\u201cD.J. Henry, that's definitely a case that we always discuss,\u201d said Boston Police Commissioner William Gross said at a civil rights task force meeting in October.\u201cBecause the people have voiced their opinion about that officer involved shooting with D.J. Henry. So, we in law enforcement, we definitely have to continue to be better each and every day.\u201d But BLM activists were not pushing for a discussion about law enforcement practices. Many were calling for taxpayer money to be reallocated under the slogan \u201cdefund the police.\u201d Boston Mayor Marty Walsh took $12 million from the police overtime budget and reallocated to homelessness service and the Boston City Council created a new office to investigate allegations of police misconduct.Statewide, Massachusetts activists had to settle for a compromise embodied in a bill on Beacon Hill that would establish a system of police accountability and oversight.In the fall support for the BLM Movement started to decline because of images of violent protests, opposition to defunding the police and against a furious backlash by conservatives, led by President Donald Trump who turned much of his re-election campaign into a call for law and order. Black Lives Matter signs were ripped from lawns in Arlington and other communities and sympathizers were cast in a bad light. A pro BLM social media posting by Democratic state representative, Tram Nguyen of Andover, triggered a furious reaction from conservative members of Vietnamese communities, who accused her of abetting communism and anarchy.\u201cThey are attempting to brand me, among other things, as a traitor to the Vietnamese American community for standing up in solidarity with Black Lives Matter and as a dishonor to my parents, my family,\u201d she told GBH News. \u201cAnd the reality of it is that I'm none of these things.\u201dSocial justice organizers pushed back, most notably in the runup to the November election, where many like Carrie Mays turned from summer street protests to signing up new voters in October. \u201cWe registered over three hundred and twenty people to vote in Boston less than a span of a month,\u201d she told GBH News. And BLM organizers were rewarded on November 3 with the defeat of Trump.University of Illinois historian Barbara Ransby the author of \u201cMaking All Black Lives Matter\u201d says beyond the election the resurgent BLM Movement of 2020 will have a lasting impact: \u201cMovement and organizers have played a critical role in changing both the climate and the culture around critical issues, but also forcing politicians to address issues they wouldn't be addressing otherwise,\u201d she said.But Ransby and others say it will still require black Americans and what she describes as \u201cwhite allies\u201d to keep the fire under the feet of the nation to make those changes complete.

      "body": "In a year with few victories to celebrate, advocates for expanded health care in Massachusetts are pointing to at least one win: More access to remote health care, or \"telehealth.\"Since early in the pandemic, health insurers have been required to cover telehealth visits as they would in-person care under emergency orders from Gov. Charlie Baker. On Wednesday, Massachusetts lawmakers passed a health care bill that makes that change permanent.The new legislation will now go to Gov. Charlie Baker's desk to be signed. It will require equity in coverage and reimbursement for all clinically appropriate telehealth visits for behavioral health, including addiction and mental health care. It would also require similar equity for primary care and care for chronic conditions for the next two years.The move represents an acknowledgement that telehealth and remote health services are here to stay.Telehealth \u2014 which includes simply appointments conducted by telephone \u2014 has been around for decades. But until this year, it represented a tiny fraction of health care visits nationwide.The pandemic changed that almost overnight, with telehealth visits shooting from about 1% of all U.S. health visits in January to a peak of nearly 50% this spring, according to the American Telehealth Association, which advocates for expanded use and coverage of telehealth services.Massachusetts Sen. Cindy Friedman, a sponsor of the new measures, says the natural, if accidental, experiment created by the pandemic has proven the utility of telehealth for certain services, especially behavioral and mental health.\u201cBehavioral health just alone, no-shows, which used to be over 60%, for a whole host of reasons, all of a sudden that no-show rate (dropped) to something like 5%. Because people all of a sudden had access in a way that they could control,\" the Middlesex Democrat said.Friedman, who was pushing for the changes before the coronavirus pandemic hit, said the need for expanded telehealth is now irrefutable.\u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place,\" Friedman said. \"You can work on something for a very long time and not get traction, and then there\u2019s an outside force that comes long that really crystalizes the need and the urgency of doing something.\"\u201cWe hit this pandemic, and it was clear where we had gaps in our health care system that we needed to address, immediately and for the long term,\" she added.Dr. Lee Schwamm, a physician and vice president for virtual care at Mass General Brigham who has advocated in favor of the legislation, said the measures are about not just patient convenience but also more equitable health care for working families.\u201cPatients who work lower-wage jobs, who don\u2019t have the flexibility to step away from work for several hours, being able to conduct a 30-minute visit is extraordinarily beneficial for everyone involved,\u201d Schwamm said.\u201cAnything we can do eradicate barriers in accessing needed care means that our patients and our health care system will be safer, healthier and less costly.\"While he believes telehealth services will ultimately bring down the costs of delivering health care, Schwamm cautioned that it will take providers some time to adapt.\u201cWe have to recognize that if you add virtual on top of in-person, at the beginning it's an added cost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system only begins to save money when there's a predictable road map, like this bill is going to provide, of several years, and also that you can bring it to scale.\u201d",

      "body": "New research shows that large corporate landlords are responsible for nearly half of all evictions in Boston \u2014 and there could be an \"eviction tsunami\u201d if they don't agree to work with tenants  when possible, advocates say. \u201cWe asked, who is responsible for lots of evictions?\" said Tim Reardon of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which partnered with the Boston Area Research Initiative on the new study. \"If we can name them, then we can target interventions and outreach.\"Reardon and his colleagues found that landlords who owned more than 100 units in Boston were responsible for 45% of all evictions in 2015 and 2016, even though they represented less than 0.5% of landlords in the market.Their report, published Monday, identifies ten large corporate landlords who have yet to sign an \u201ceviction diversion pledge,\u201d promising to abide by the current federal moratorium, proactively engage with residents to create payment plans, promote rent adjustments for subsidized housing and conduct mediation in case eviction cases are filed.\u201cNow city councilors, the mayor or neighborhood development advocacy organizations can pick up the phone and actually call 10 specific landlords and say, we need you to sign this pledge. We need you to get on board,\" Reardon added.Though small and medium-sized landlords make up almost 90% of all landlords and 44% of all rental units across the city, the report shows that they only make up 27% of all evictions. \u201cOur research also found that only 10% of evictions happen in buildings that are owner-occupied,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201cfurther suggesting that small landlords who have a personal relationship with their tenants may be more willing to work with them to avoid eviction.\u201d Alexander Sturke, a spokesperson from the city\u2019s Department of Neighborhood Development, said that the city has been calling landlords since October asking them to sign onto the pledge.\u201cOne of the things that's difficult about those specific ten landlords is that it's not clear that they, five years on, are still the biggest offenders,\u201d Sturke told GBH News. \u201cSo we will definitely call them, but because the data is so old, it's really hard to comment on what their current standing is.\u201d The city has worked with both BARI and MAPC to find more data on the biggest eviction offenders, Sturke said, but housing court data is difficult to attain. \u201cThe housing court is notoriously difficult to get information out of,\" he said. \"They're not forthcoming. We literally had to send people to physically go through physical files. There's no automated data system. There's no data dump that we could have gotten.\u201d The most recent data researchers and the city could access was from 2015 and 2015, Sturke said. \u201cNext year we'll have 2016 \u2013 2017 data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're always like two or three years behind.\u201d Forrest Hangen, a researcher at BARI, sais this is a \u201cfirst step\u201d for city officials to begin to examine pandemic-related evictions, which may have different causes but are likely affected by pre-existing issues within the city. \u201cThe data is still sort of opening up, and it\u2019s still very much a difficult thing,\u201d Hangen told GBH News. \u201cWe\u2019re using the data to look at historical patterns of eviction, and there\u2019s an assumption that the same and similar patterns are what's being enacted now.\u201d Reardon says regardless of the age of the data, it\u2019s still important that big companies on the list, which operate a total of 4,000 rental units, are pledging to work with tenants to avoid large-scale evictions across the city. \u201cWe can't say that those ten landlords who haven't signed are going to be responsible for a lot of evictions, but we know that they have been in the past,\u201d Reardon said. \u201cSo it's worth calling them.\u201d The eight companies that have signed the pledge, according to the report, conducted an average of 75 evictions per year during the study period. Those who have not signed the pledge were associated with approximately 25 evictions per year during pre-pandemic times, \u201cmaking them worthy of scrutiny and further encouragement to sign the pledge,\u201d the report reads. Eviction filings for non-payment in Massachusetts are consistently breaking 2020 records on a weekly basis, with 4,200 cases filed in housing court since the Massachusetts eviction moratorium expired in October, according to trial court data compiled by BARI and MAPC. Last week, lawmakers in Washington, D.C., passed a COVID-19 relief act that extended a federal eviction moratorium from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which took effect in Massachusetts after a state eviction moratorium expired. The federal order does not prevent landlords from filing eviction proceedings or verbally threatening eviction, and it doesn't stop tenants from having to pay rent, according to the Massachusetts Housing Court. Because it doesn\u2019t prevent landlords from moving forward with the written process of evictions, Reardon said the order doesn\u2019t give tenants enough time to ensure that they won\u2019t be evicted at the end of January. \u201cThere's no way that a landlord could file and get an order to evict in the space that we have between the end of the state moratorium and even the new end of the [federal] moratorium,\u201d he said. \u201cThe CDC process doesn't do very much, and nothing is preventing those informal evictions of people getting a notice to quit and then just saying, I'm not going to court, I'm not doing any of that \u2014 I\u2019ll just move, cut my losses and then go.\u201d Reardon says this leads to situations where tenants are forced to choose between homelessness or doubling up with another group or family in a residence, \u201cboth of which are big risk factors for COVID-19, so it just kind of contributes to the spread of the pandemic.\u201d ",

      "body": "Good luck getting tickets this holiday period if you want to ski in Massachusetts. A combination of pent-up energy, early season snowfall and tough COVID restrictions in other New England states has pushed demand through the roof.\u201cAs we headed into this season, we anticipated demand for skiing and snowboarding to be higher than normal,\u201d said Tom Meyers, Director of Marketing at the Wachusett Mountain Ski Area in Princeton. \u201cWe saw anecdotally throughout the summer and fall hiking on Wachusett Mountain was probably at an all time high. And I think it was evidence of people\u2019s desire to get outdoors for a socially distant, healthy recreational activity and we anticipated that would carry into skiing for the winter.\u201dIn this year of COVID, officials at ski areas across the state aren\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry. The weather has been great \u2014 lots of early season snow and cold evening temperatures have enabled the snowmakers to do their thing. And, because of the pandemic, people are desperate to get outdoors for recreation and a sense of normalcy. But then there\u2019s the pandemic itself: Because of state-mandated occupancy limits, it will be much harder for the mountains to make money from food and drinks, or their ski shops.At Wachusett, which opened a month ago, demand has been so heavy that skiers and snowboarders can\u2019t buy a full day or night pass. The mountain created what they call \u201csessions,\u201d breaking the day up into four parts with 3 \u2013 4 hours of skiing in each. Many of those sessions have already sold out this season.Berkshire East in Charlemont and Catamount in Sheffield have done something similar, though owner Jon Schaefer said they also allow customers to buy an all-day pass. \u201cWe opened with a snowstorm, so we started off with a bang last week,\u201d Schaefer said from a chairlift at his Berkshire East Mountain Resort. \u201cOur team\u2019s been adapting. It\u2019s obviously a very different playing board from previous years, but we\u2019re working through it.\u201dCOVID restrictions mean that lodges can only be at 25 percent capacity. Resorts will post monitors at the doors to count comings and goings. And they\u2019ve cautioned skiers that lodge access is restricted, so they should plan on storing items in their vehicles and eating outside.To that end, Berkshire East created 100 \u201cski cabanas,\u201d so people can reserve their own mini lodges with tables and heaters. The cabanas are designed for 6-8 people. Schaefer said he did a lot of math this fall to figure out how many people the mountain can \u2014 and should \u2014 hold to at least break even. He\u2019s optimistic, in part because of strict quarantine rules in nearby states. Vermont, for example, requires people to quarantine for two-weeks before going into the state, or quarantine for a week and show a negative COVID test. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of new faces,\u201d Schaefer said, referring to both his Berkshire East and Catamount resorts. \u201cThese are community ski areas, and it\u2019s like old home days whenever you open. And I would say this year more than ever there\u2019s a lot of new people.\u201d ",

      "body": "As the COVID-19 pandemic hit hard in the spring, fishermen watched their markets dry up. Restaurants and cafeterias \u2014 normally major fish buyers \u2014 closed or cut back orders significantly. Fishermen weren't sure if they were going to get paid for what they brought to the dock.Meanwhile as people lost jobs, food banks started to see an unprecedented demand for services. Things were getting desperate, with long lines for food assistance in many states.Out of these dual crises, a new idea was born. Food assistance programs across the country have started connecting with local fishermen to stock up on local seafood, many for the first time. And the arrangement seems to be helping the fishermen, the economy and those in need of healthy food.In Massachusetts, the Greater Boston Food Bank, which serves more than 500,000 food-insecure people with its 600-plus network partners, was looking for ideas.According to Catherine D'Amato, president and CEO, the network usually keeps four or five weeks of food on hand in case of emergencies.The pandemic hit, and by \"late May ... we found ourselves below one week of inventory and going down rapidly,\" she says. That's because the food bank normally distributes about 1 million pounds of food a week, and that became 2 1/2 million pounds of food a week, D'Amato says.While Congress and the states have boosted funding for food banks, and increased donations of fresh produce, meat, dairy and shelf-stable products during the pandemic, it hasn't been enough.\"For many years, we have been wanting to be able to work with organizations in the fishing industry,\" D'Amato says. But it's complicated. Fishermen catch a lot of big fish, and food banks who might take it need the products to be cut small and easy to use for clients. It also has to be fish they know and recognize.The barriers have been too high in many places to make it work.But this spring, the state department of agriculture connected the food bank with some grant makers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other entities. They talked to some local fishermen about developing a traditional New England haddock chowder.Haddock is plentiful in Cape Cod Bay, but it's not in high demand because it's rather small and doesn't fillet well, according to the Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen's Alliance. In other words, it's perfect for chowder.The grants paid fishermen for their catch and provided seed money for a local manufacturer to process, freeze and deliver the chowder to food banks in family-size servings.\"We worked with the manufacturer to create a nutrient-rich recipe and to date, we've received 48,000 pounds. And now we have started to purchase the product,\" D'Amato says. \"It's very tasty and popular.\"Studies have shown eating just one or two servings of seafood a week can reduce the risk of coronary death by up to 36%. And preliminary research into the omega-3 fatty acids found in many types of fish can help treat or protect against age-related cognitive decline such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Eating more of certain kinds of fish has also been shown to reduce asthma symptoms in city kids exposed to pollution.But many people are not sure how to cook fresh seafood, and it can be expensive if you're on a budget. That may be why many feeding programs haven't handled a lot of fresh fish.\"We have handled, you know, your typical fish sticks or fish made with a breading on it,\" D'Amato says \u2014 which she says is not necessarily the healthiest option.But the new chowder is chock-full of vegetables, and it's easy \u2014 just heat and serve.\"Consumers are used to red meat, poultry in every shape and form. Pork is sort of further down the list. We do offer items like tofu. ... But fish has been a missing component,\" she says.The chowder, branded as \"Small Boats, Big Taste,\" is helping to feed families and keep fishermen fishing in Massachusetts. The fishermen hope to sell it in retail stores in the next year, and D'Amato hopes to purchase more chowder and expand into new seafood products for her clients this winter.In other parts of the country, local fishermen hurt by COVID-19 are getting to work supplying food banks, too.Paul Parker is the founder of Catch Together, a nonprofit organization that works with small-scale fishermen to connect the local fishing industry with the local community. Catch Together provided some of the grants for the chowder project and others around the country.When the pandemic hit, \"Our first round of funding was to just make sure that small-scale fishing organizations and their leadership were able to continue their typical programming in 2020,\" he says. That means things like fisheries management and keeping consumer markets open.\"The second phase of our work was to begin doing outreach to commercial fishing organizations and to food banks around the country and try to learn about places where we could help provide fishermen fair wages to go fishing while simultaneously providing great, healthy food for people that needed it,\" Parker says.Catch Together set out to support up to 10,000 fishermen to provide food for 1 million Americans in need this year. It's led to innovative programs that are putting local shrimp in Mississippi food banks and getting sockeye salmon to the needy in Alaska.Catch Together also gave a $53,000 grant to the Commercial Fisherman of Santa Barbara. The fishermen worked with community partners this summer to get 7,000 pounds of flash-frozen Pacific rockfish, yellowtail, grenadier, white sea bass and black cod fillets into their local food bank.It was a hit, and they plan to expand the offerings this winter to include bringing fresh fish to soup kitchens as the pandemic continues, says Mike Nelson, the Commercial Fisherman of Santa Barbara's program officer.While COVID-19 has caused a lot of hardships, it's also created new opportunities for fishermen. The food bank partnership is one part of it.For fisherman Paul Teall, when his usual restaurant buyers in Los Angeles stopped buying this fall because the county restricted restaurant business to takeout only, selling directly to consumers at a small seafood market on the dock in Santa Barbara suddenly became a lot more important.Teall is a longtime Santa Barbara fisherman who sells a variety of seafood native to West Coast waters, including rock crabs and a large sea snail called Kellet's whelk.The seafood market has been open to the public for about 30 years. Once the pandemic started, people who had never come to the market before started showing up, saying they didn't want to risk shopping in grocery stores, Teall says.\"We've seen the sales spike \u2014 maybe double. So I think a lot more people are feeling comfortable buying in the open air,\" Teall says.Joseph and Melissa Garrigan of Garrigan Seafood Co. say business has been better at the market lately, too. They sell giant spider crabs and California spiny lobsters among other things.The pandemic has \"actually been good for us. ... [A] lot of people are coming out and going, 'Wow, I didn't know this [market] was here.' And we feel like the community knows we're here now,\" Joseph Garrigan says.The fishermen recently put up plastic film barriers between themselves and customers, and there's a cleaning and filleting station. Everyone at the market has to wear a face covering.\"We're doing everything we can to keep the customers safe and provide them with fresh food,\" Teall says.  Copyright 2020 NPR.

      "body": "Massachusetts\u2019 biggest story of 2020 involved something so tiny it required an electron microscope to view.The coronavirus pandemic hit the Bay State hard, killing nearly 12,000 \u2014 the nation's ninth-highest death toll \u2014 and ravaging communities of color and long-term care facilities. Nearly 80 veterans died of COVID-19 at the Holyoke Soldiers' Home, where investigators said \u201cutterly baffling\u201d decisions allowed the virus to spread unchecked.But Massachusetts also played a pivotal role in the global race for a vaccine. Studies showed a vaccine developed by Cambridge-based Moderna Inc. offered strong protection against the virus, and the company began shipping it out after gaining emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration.Here are the other top stories that grabbed headlines and attention in 2020:1. College Admissions ScandalFederal prosecutions of parents who paid bribes to get their children into competitive U.S. colleges and universities were a top story in 2019, and this past year, two of the most prominent defendants were brought to justice. \u201cFull House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, both were sentenced to prison time \u2014 appearing before a federal judge in Boston via video link because of the pandemic.2. Kennedy Out; Warren Falls ShortU.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren's failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, after considerable momentum early in the campaign cycle, dominated politics in Massachusetts. So did U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, who gambled \u2014 and lost \u2014 big by betting he could win the Democratic primary. Sen. Edward Markey, a progressive, prevailed, and Kennedy became the first in his storied political dynasty to lose a race for Congress in Massachusetts.3. Harvard Cleared Of BiasA federal appeals court ruled that Harvard doesn't discriminate against Asian American applicants. The decision offered relief to other colleges that consider race in admissions, but also set the stage for a potential review by an increasingly conservative U.S. Supreme Court. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston rejected claims from an anti-affirmative action group that accused the Ivy League University of imposing a \u201cracial penalty\u201d on Asian Americans.4. Tsarnaev's Death Sentence TossedA federal appeals court threw out Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\u2019s death sentence, saying the judge who oversaw the case did not adequately screen jurors for potential biases. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered a new penalty-phase trial on whether the 27-year-old Tsarnaev should be executed for the 2013 attack that killed three people and wounded more than 260 others. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.5. High Court HistoryJustice Kimberly Budd made history as she was sworn in as the chief justice of Massachusetts\u2019 highest court. Budd, 54, is the first Black woman to serve as chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, which traces its history to the late 17th century. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker nominated her to succeed Chief Justice Ralph Gants, an acclaimed jurist who died in September.6. Bye Bye BradyNobody knew it at the time, but on Jan. 4, Tom Brady played his last game as a Patriot at Gillette Stadium. The six-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback's storied run in New England ended with a thud and a 20-13 loss to the Tennessee Titans. Two and a half months later, Brady embarked on what he called a \u201cnew football journey\u201d and signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, where he was joined by former Patriots star Rob Gronkowski.7. The Mayflower's 400thThe state marked the 400th anniversary of the 1620 Pilgrim landing, but unconventionally, and not just because of coronavirus restrictions. Yearlong events emphasized the history and experience of the Indigenous people who, at their own peril, helped the white European settlers survive. Members of the Wampanoag tribe and the descendants of those who sailed from England on the Mayflower \u2014 mindful of 2020's nationwide reckoning with entrenched racism \u2014 were determined to openly and truthfully revisit the Pilgrims' complicated legacy.8. Ex-Nissan CEO's EscapeA father and son from Massachusetts allegedly helped spirit former Nissan Motor Co. CEO Carlos Ghosn out of Japan while he was awaiting trial. The U.S. State Department agreed to turn over Michael Taylor, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, and his son, Peter Taylor. A federal judge intervened to block the men's immediate removal while she reviewed an emergency petition filed by their lawyers. The Taylors are charged with helping Ghosn flee the country in 2019 with the former Nissan boss tucked away in a box on a private jet.9. eBay HarassmentFive former employees of eBay Inc. pleaded guilty to charges stemming from their alleged involvement in a cyberstalking campaign. Federal prosecutors said the scheme included having live spiders and other disturbing deliveries sent to a Massachusetts couple who had published an online newsletter critical of the online auction site. Two other employees also were charged. Investigators said the victims were targeted after their newsletter published an article about a lawsuit filed by eBay that accused Amazon of poaching its sellers. San Jose, California-based eBay fired the employees.",

      "body": "For some, 2020 meant the loss of a loved one, a job or the ability to go to school. For many healthcare workers, it meant long, exhausting hours spent battling a virus in extremely sick patients. For other people, it meant staying home, avoiding gatherings and missing loved ones. And many had to go out in the world \u2014 to work as first responders, in supermarkets or at other jobs we all rely on. But this year, everybody in Massachusetts was somehow impacted by COVID-19. GBH News reporters, producers and hosts spent 2020 documenting those pandemic stories. Here\u2019s just some of what happened in a very busy year.A pair of surgesThe first COVID-19 case in Massachusetts was confirmed on Feb. 1, and the first death in the state was the following month. Since then, more than 311,000 people in Massachusetts have been infected, and about 11,500 have died.Case numbers began spiking in the spring. By May, the state was seeing between 2,000 and 3,000 newly confirmed cases a day. That went down in June and stayed lower through the summer. But by the fall, things started getting worse. By late September, the percentage of COVID-19 tests that were positive had risen to roughly 3.5%, from about 2% earlier in the month. The number of Massachusetts cities and towns considered in the high risk \u201cred zone\u201d had also nearly doubled in a week.As the year comes to a close, the state is seeing between 5,000 and 6,000 newly confirmed cases a day \u2014 twice what it saw during the May surge. That's likely in large part because we're doing far more testing now than we were in the spring. The hospitalization and death rates are still lower than they were in the first surge. But the number of patients in the hospitals has been steadily increasing since October, and the death rate is on the rise, too. Public health officials worry holiday gatherings could lead to a spike in the already-high case numbers.Vulnerable populationsPeople of color have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, both in the number of infections and in the severity of outcomes. In April, Dr. Joseph Betancourt of Massachusetts General Hospital told GBH News that 35 to 40 percent of COVID patients admitted to the hospital were Latino. And the disparities are clear in data from the COVID Racial Data Tracker.Early on, it also became clear that people living in various kinds of congregate care settings were among the most vulnerable. Nursing homes took early steps to prevent infections, but those proved unsuccessful, with more than 6,000 residents of the state\u2019s elder care facilities dying in the pandemic. Among the worst outbreaks was at the Holyoke Soldiers Home, where more than 75 residents died, prompting a federal investigation and state legislation. Homes for people with intellectual disabilities also saw outbreaks of the virus. Prisons and immigration detention centers were vulnerable, too.Homeless shelters were hit hard early on in the state\u2019s spring surge. In early April, the city reported one in three homeless people tested were positive for COVID-19. At the same time, the pandemic made it harder for homeless families to to access state aid.Shutting down & reopening MassachusettsOn a statewide level, things seemed to get real on March 15, when Gov. Charlie Baker announced he was closing all public schools for three weeks, banning visitors from nursing homes and assisted living facilities and prohibiting more than 25 people getting together in any single room \u2014 including in gyms and theaters. Indoor dining was banned in all restaurants. By March 18, all early education and child care centers were ordered closed, too.The shutdown was especially devastating to small businesses like beauty parlors, barbers, small hotels and independent movie theaters like the Brattle and the West Newton Cinema.Performing arts organizations and local theaters suddenly found the curtains closed, leaving them in financial peril. A relief fund was set up to help artists who couldn\u2019t work because of the pandemic.Among the industries hardest hit were restaurants.\u201cWe are all hoping and praying that the government's going to come in and bail [restaurants] out,\u201d chef Ming Tsai told GBH News back in March. \u201cWe're very good for bailing out big businesses, [but] we have to bail out the small businesses this time.\u201dThat hasn\u2019t happened.The state has made a number of investments over the year to try to slow the economic damage, including a $10 million small business loan fund early on in the pandemic, a $13 million relief fund for local foundations and community organizations in April, a $275 million relief package for cities and towns in June, a $1.1 billion COVID-19 spending bill in July and another $773 million relief package in October. Boston set up its own resiliency fund. After the new federal stimulus compromise was sealed, Baker announced a new $668 million grant program for business relief last week.The governor\u2019s decisions this year about what businesses must shut down and which could stay open have received mixed reviews. In May, a poll showed 84% of Massachusetts residents approved of Baker's response to the pandemic. But some critics said the state acted too slowly.Two months after the shutdown, Baker released a phased plan for reopening the state\u2019s economy. As businesses began reopening in June with new safety precautions, the world looked like a very different place. A lawsuit alleging Baker had overstepped his authority in issuing the shutdown order was heard by the state\u2019s highest court. The court ruled in the governor\u2019s favor in December.After case numbers began rapidly increasing again in the fall, calls started getting louder for Baker to roll back the state\u2019s reopening plan. In early December, Baker did just that \u2014 cutting indoor capacity in most public indoor areas to 40% and limiting indoor dining to six people at a table. That move was met with an understated \u201cgolf clap\u201d by some health experts, who felt the governor should have been much more restrictive.The following week, Boston, Somerville, Newton and Brockton announced they were imposing restrictions beyond what the state was requiring.In late December, fearing another holiday spike like one seen after Thanksgiving, Baker went further, lowering capacity limits for most businesses and places of worship to a maximum of 25%, limiting outdoor events to 25 people and limiting indoor gatherings to 10 people.An epidemic of unemploymentWith the shutdown came major disruptions to the labor market \u2014 and to people\u2019s lives.Businesses scrambled to figure out how to survive in a whole new environment. Many institutions shut down factories or closed their doors for good. Even if they did manage to stay open, many places cut their workforce. All of this meant that the number of people filing for unemployment shot up. In a typical week before the pandemic, somewhere around 7,000 people in Massachusetts applied for unemployment benefits. In the four weeks after the lockdown in March, more than half a million people in the state filled jobless claims. In April, unemployment in the commonwealth hit a high of 16.8%, and the state's unemployment system was swamped. As high as the numbers were, they didn\u2019t count everyone. Initially, some people \u2014 like barbers \u2014 didn't easily qualify for unemployment insurance. Eventually, the state rolled out a new system that included benefits for the self-employed, contractors and workers in the \u201cgig economy.\u201dThe dire situation was also reflected in state\u2019s public assistance programs \u2014 such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Transitional Aid to Families with Dependent Children program \u2014 which saw huge increases in the number of applicants. Nonprofit food banks saw an unprecedented rise in need while, simultaneously, working to adapt to new guidelines about safety and contagion in a pandemic. There were also efforts to make sure the newly unemployed had access to health insurance and secure housing, neither of which was a guarantee. The federal government tried to help with stimulus checks and a weekly boost of $600 on top of state unemployment. This helped many stave off poverty. For others, it created a surprising dilemma: They could make more receiving unemployment benefits than they could working. But those $600 checks didn\u2019t last. For many, the stress of unemployment was compounded by the anxiety and whiplash of watching as Washington, D.C., debated new stimulus plans, including help for the unemployed.Teaching and learning in a new eraAt all educational levels, the pandemic has caused a major learning disruption and required entirely new approaches to teaching.After the initial shutdown left K-12 classrooms off-limits toward the end of last academic year, some districts brought students back while others have remained fully remote.Still others are using a hybrid approach, with some students in the classroom and others learning remotely. While allowing for greater social distancing, that model has presented challenges. In remote classrooms, schools have seen absentee rates as high as 12%, and many are trying to track students down. Remote learning has presented significant challenges, especially in districts like Revere and Lynn, which have fewer resources. It also hasn't been easy for parents working from home. There\u2019s been a lively debate over the last year about whether the value of in-person learning outweighs concerns over the possible spread, with teachers, in particular raising questions about whether classroom ventilation and filtration is sufficient. The Baker administration has pushed for remote learning to be a \u201clast resort.\u201dWith everything changed, the stakes for high school seniors are especially high. In our \u201cCOVID and the Classroom\u201d series, GBH News has been following students to find out how COVID-19 is impacting them, shaping their futures and playing out in their communities.Massachusetts\u2019 colleges and universities have also had to frantically adapt to this new reality, adopting remote learning technologies and setting up robust testing systems for students on campus. It\u2019s also been a financial stress. Read a complete wrap-up of GBH News\u2019 coverage of higher education during the pandemic here.The virus\u2019 tollThe first death in Massachusetts officially attributed to COVID-19 was reported on March 20. By the close of 2020, more than 10,000 people have died of the virus in the state. Behind that enormous number are real people, and their communities are still processing the loss. There was the couple that was married for 67 year and died three days apart, both from COVID. There was the gregarious father who was about to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary. More stories of some of those lives lost this year can be found here. Even when patients have recovered from the virus, they\u2019re often still carrying its effects with them. So-called \u201clong haulers\u201d continue to deal with a range of persistent symptoms. From muscle pain to brain fog to exhaustion, the long-term consequences can be debilitating. Experts are still trying to figure out the science behind these long-lasting symptoms. And even coronavirus patients who are fully recovered have struggled with mental and emotional challenges. The pandemic has also placed a particular burden on on the elderly, who are especially vulnerable to the virus, and their caretakers. For example, for those who already faced the daily challenges of caring for loved ones with dementia, the pandemic has only made things harder. In an effort to stave off isolation and depression, one independent living facility created a socially-distanced hugging booth. For many feeling stranded at home during this pandemic, the toll on mental health can't be calculated. For some, that means coping with mounting anxiety and stress. One nationwide survey found anxiety and depression was on the rise among younger adults because of the pandemic. Many felt overloaded as the lockdown wore on and limits on socializing stretched from weeks into months. For those already in hard situations, the pandemic often made things worse. Indeed, experts worried that the coronavirus meant even more isolation for those experiencing domestic violence. It made it even harder to get away from an abusive partner and reduced the safeguards in place. Others have suggested the pandemic could cause an uptick in divorces. From lives lost to lives irrevocably altered, the coronavirus and its consequences have touched everyone in Massachusetts. Testing & tracing Knowing who\u2019s infected with COVID-19 has always been a key to preventing its spread. But from the beginning, widespread testing has been a challenge in the state. Hospitals started setting up drive-through testing sites in March, but Massachusetts didn\u2019t have enough tests to meet the need, especially for first responders. By May, Baker said the state had the capacity to conduct 30,000 tests a day, but regularly fell far short of that because of supply chain issues related to necessary materials and transportation. Hospitals across the state were having to postpone surgeries because they couldn\u2019t get the reagents necessary to conduct tests, so they didn\u2019t know if their patients were infected.Later in May, Baker pledged to dramatically expand testing, with a target of 75,000 tests per day by the end of the year. That\u2019s a goal that was met. In the final weeks of 2020, the state was averaging more than 85,000 tests a day. However, there have been persistent concerns about how long it can take to get test results. In July, free testing sites were set up in some of the communities hardest hit by the pandemic. And in August, Massachusetts joined with six other states to buy millions of rapid antigen tests.Many sites wouldn\u2019t test people who weren\u2019t showing symptoms of the virus. But as case numbers began to increase again in the fall, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced several testing sites in the city specifically intended for asymptomatic people. In April, Baker received national press and praise for launching the \u201cCOVID-19 Community Tracing Collaborative\u201d (CTC). Partnering with the global health care nonprofit Partners In Health and local boards of health, the CTC grew to several thousand contact tracers. Following a common public health strategy, the contact tracers reach out to every person who tested positive for COVID-19 or might have been exposed and help them isolate themselves. For many of the contact tracers, this was hard, emotional work that left them worrying about those they\u2019d spoken with on the weekends and afterhours. Contact tracing is extremely labor intensive. In the first six months of the CTC, the state spent $66 million on the effort. It also relies on widespread and rapid testing. As COVID-19 cases surged in the fall and winter, some experts began to question whether this effort was the best use of limited resources. However, the state has continued to invest in contact tracing.An unprecedented healthcare challenge The pandemic has put a significant stress on Massachusetts\u2019 healthcare system and on the doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers who care for patients. At the peak of the spring surge, nearly 4,000 people were hospitalized at one time. Nurses saw it coming. \u201cWe are bracing ourselves for what we're calling a tidal wave of patients,\u201d Tufts Medical Center operating room nurse Mary Havlicek Cornacchia said in March.In April, the state took steps to double the number of intensive and emergency care beds to deal with that tidal wave. That included setting up field hospitals in Worcester and at the Boston Convention Center. Those field hospitals were closed after hospitalizations fell, but they started opening again in the fall as the state saw another spike.The pandemic put a significant financial strain on hospitals and community health centers.For many healthcare professionals, the surge was a scary and lonely time. Some chose not to work because of the risk. For the thousands who did see COVID-19 patients day after day, it was an intense and exhausting challenge. Some found themselves drawing parallels to, and lessons from, their own experiences responding to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.Like the rest of the nation, hospital workers in Massachusetts didn\u2019t have enough masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment to keep them safe. A system was set up to decontaminate N-95 masks so they could be reworn more safely.Over the year, we\u2019ve been hearing directly from many healthcare workers about their experiences. A nurse in the Berkshires described wearing the same N-95 mask every day until it fell apart. An ICU nurse at Tufts Medical Center described caring for \u201cthe sickest group of patients\u201d she\u2019d ever seen in her 30 years on the job. A nurse in Cambridge, who had the virus herself, described feeling anxious as case numbers increase again in the fall. A speech pathologist quarantined in an RV in her driveway because of exposure to infected patients. And chaplains at MGH and at the Hebrew SeniorLife nursing home spoke about finding ways to provide spiritual care for patients and staff. Every healthcare worker in the state has their own story, as the pandemic has challenged them both professionally and personally.Staying safeAvoiding infection has meant that ordinary people have had to change their routines and really focus on things most never imagined could be so important. Among the most obvious changes is the need to wear a mask. In July, GBH News reporters took an informal tally of how many people were wearing masks at various spots around the state and found that most were taking masks seriously. While masks have been shown to reduce the spread of the virus, they present a significant barrier to communication for those who are deaf and hard of hearing.We\u2019ve also learned what it means to \u201csocially distance\u201d from one another, even on holidays, and had to consider carefully everything from the safety of public bathrooms to who we include in our inner circle. We\u2019ve started paying attention to things we never thought of before, like the quality of air filters in our workplaces and schools. We sta",

      "body": "Retired teacher Shirley Nolan raised her arms aloft after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine, exclaiming, \"Hallelujah.\"Nolan was the first resident of Boston's Edgar P. Benjamin Healthcare Center to get the shot, a moment captured on video and publicized by state health officials as efforts began Monday to vaccinate long-term care residents in Massachusetts.The coronavirus has exacted a tragic toll on long-term care centers both in the state and nationally and the risks faced by their residents and workforce have placed the facilities near the front vaccine rollout line.In Massachusetts, where long-term care fatalities account for 60 percent of the 12,110 COVID-19 deaths logged so far, the Baker administration's vaccine distribution timeline puts long-term care, rest homes and assisted living facilities in the first phase, as the second demographic eligible for the shots after health care workers involved in pandemic response.Through a partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CVS and Walgreens are administering vaccines to nursing home and assisted living residents, with the pharmacies handling scheduling and coordination of on-site clinics, supply ordering, data reporting and cold chain management of the vaccines.Officials at the state's COVID-19 command center said this month that they expected between 40,000 and 60,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be shipped to CVS and Walgreens for skilled nursing facilities in Massachusetts.Separately, the VA Bedford Healthcare System began vaccinating its long-term care residents on Dec. 14, when 96-year-old World War II veteran Margaret Klessens became the first VA patient in the country to receive the vaccine.Monday marked \"a day of hope\" at The Ellis Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Norwood, where a team from CVS arrived at 11 a.m. and started vaccinating staff, with plans to begin working with residents after lunch, administrator Anthony Franchi said.Another vaccine clinic at The Ellis is planned for Tuesday, and Franchi told the News Service Monday afternoon that \"things are going very well\" so far.\"I think there was some trepidation before today, but there's definitely excitement,\" he said. \"There's hope, I think that's the best way to describe it. More people are signing up today than we had figured.\"Franchi said managing through the pandemic has required a day-at-a-time approach, and he's been unable \"to look into the future too much,\" crediting staff with working together to do their best for the residents.\"I think there's hope in the air with 2021 right around the corner,\" Franchi said, describing the mood in the facility as \"encouraged.\"As of last Tuesday, before the long-term care vaccination campaign began, 35,618 people in Massachusetts had received their first of the two vaccine doses, according to the Department of Public Health.In a recent MassINC Polling Group survey of 1,180 Massachusetts residents, 36 percent said they would like to take a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it's possible for them to do so, with 47 percent saying they wanted to wait until either a few people they know or many other people get the shot first. When the results are broken down by age, 45 percent of people age 60 and over said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible.The Massachusetts Senior Care Association, which represents more than 350 nursing and long-term care facilities, earlier this month launched a vaccine-promotion campaign aimed at providing residents and workers with information on safety and efficacy of the vaccines so that they will feel comfortable taking them.Association President Tara Gregorio said Monday that many nursing homes are reporting that more than 90 percent of their residents have consented to COVID-19 vaccination and that \"a growing number of staff are planning to be vaccinated.\" The organization plans to monitor vaccine rollout \"to ensure that the safety and well-being of our residents and their caregivers are appropriately prioritized,\" she said.\"Today marks a critical and hopeful milestone in our fight against COVID-19 with the first wave of vaccines being distributed today in nursing facilities across the Commonwealth,\" Gregorio said in a statement to the News Service.As of Sunday, 414 long-term care facilities in Massachusetts had reported at least one probable or confirmed case of COVID-19 since the pandemic first took hold here, with a total of 7,247 COVID-19 deaths reported in long-term care facilities, according to DPH data. More than 30,000 long-term care residents and workers have been diagnosed with probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19.State public health officials identified 131 new clusters of two or more COVID-19 cases in long-term care facilities between Nov. 22 and Dec. 19, and another 195 previously identified clusters were still considered ongoing, the DPH reported last Thursday.",

      "body": "Police have been under a lot of scrutiny this year, with many calling for reforms following the killings of George Floyd and others by officers. A new article by three Massachusetts General Hospital neurologists makes the case that there is no medical justification for the use of neck restraints like chokeholds by police officers. One of the article's authors, Dr. Altaf Saadi, spoke with GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: Back in May, we saw George Floyd die when Minneapolis police officer Derrick Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than eight minute. I know everybody remembers the best-known case of an officer killing a person with a chokehold, in 2014, when Eric Garner died at the hands of a New York City police officer. He'd been selling loose cigarettes. How did you and your colleagues come to be interested in looking at this specifically?Dr. Altaf Saadi: As neurologists, we start very early on in our training hearing this adage that time is brain. What that implies to us is that even milliseconds of having interruption of blood flow to the brain can have really devastating consequences. So as neurologists, stories like Eric Garner's death and George Floyd's death, which involved having his carotid essentially compressed for eight minutes and forty-six seconds, was just really shocking to us, because we know that such a technique can be so dangerous to someone's health \u2014 and even fatal. So that really motivated us to write this piece. Rath: Can you explain, when we're talking about chokeholds as examined in your article, specifically what kind of physical action is being taken by an officer on the subject? Talking about these two cases, George Floyd and Eric Garner, there were different physical actions taken prior to the deaths. What kind of range are we talking about? Saadi: So the police departments distinguish between two different types of neck restraints. They refer to one as chokeholds, which involves applying pressure to restrict the airway, and then they also refer to strangle-holds, which is applying pressure to restrict the blood flow of the brain. And they differentiate this, but really we're talking about a really narrow space right in someone's neck that separates the trachea versus the carotid area. Here are these actions involved pressing or laying on a person's back to keep their face down, using an arm to restrain someone's neck, or \u2014 as was the case with George Floyd\u2014 knee-to-neck holds.Rath: Tell us a bit more about what a chokehold physically does to an individual \u2014 the disruption of vital bodily processes, the physical trauma. What happens?Saadi: There are a lot of negative health consequences to the brain not receiving blood and oxygen. That can include brain damage. It can include stroke, it can include seizure. It can include arrhythmia, so even potentially really fatal heart, irregular heart rhythms. And it can include tearing of the neck vessels, which can lead to stroke weeks later. So there are complications not just in the short term, but there can also be complications several weeks afterwards that would be difficult to trace as being a consequence. We know that there are both short and long-term consequences, and obviously the most devastating consequences is death. We know that these consequences are even higher if someone has conditions like coronary artery disease, for example. We know that police officers are not doing a complete assessment of someone's past medical history before applying this technique, so it really is this wide range of potential complications from this technique. The other thing I want to mention, and that we mentioned in our article, is that interrupting the blood supply to the brain for as little as four seconds can lead to a loss of consciousness. We cite a study in our article that used cadavers to see what's the minimum amount of weight that would be required to interrupt the blood going through the carotid artery, and that was six kilograms, which is the weight of a household cat. That's (much less than) the average of an adult male, and certainly not for eight minutes and forty six seconds. Rath: Tell us a bit about the perspective, the scientific perspective, that you're taking here. It would seem intuitive to most people that there's not a medical justification for chokeholds and neck restraints, but how are you looking at the data and employing this to come to this conclusion? Saadi: A lot of these studies that have been published, like the one I just mentioned, weren't done in the context of studying carotid restraints used by police officers. The article that I just mentioned where they were trying to see what the minimum weight required to compress the carotid artery was just trying to advance our understanding of carotid pathophysiology. They just were using a cadaver and they were trying to understand how this works medically for us to apply to other contexts other than law enforcement. Essentially what we did is look at what had been written out there about carotid compression and made inferences from that to the context of these techniques being used in a law enforcement context. I think it's really important to point out that I'm a researcher, and so I'm always looking for data. One of the things that's really striking here is that although a lot of police departments talk about this being supposedly a safe technique to use, there's really no data transparency about police custody deaths or situations requiring use of techniques like neck restraints. So that's one of the things we called for at the very minimum \u2014 to try to have more transparency around this data. Rath: Even though it may be obvious on a gut level to many of us, if people are making the argument that this is totally safe, you sort of need the the data there to to back it up. Saadi: Yeah. You know, I think that for us as neurologists, it's intuitive, but I have seen quotes from police departments where they say things like, well, we're not choking anyone, we are using a carotid restraint. I think for some people, that language is very medicalized, and the use of medical lingo gives it some air of legitimacy on the surface, so a lot of people don't actually question it. I think that's what we were hoping to try to do here, because as a neurologist, I hear that and I think, why would you ever want to use a carotid restraint? That's not safe. I wouldn't trust a doctor or a nurse to perform this technique, much less a cop who's not trained as a medical professional. Rath: For obvious reasons, we're focusing on the deaths from this. But shy of people being killed, for this kind of brain trauma, there's potentially a horrendous range of consequences for survivors, right?Saadi: Exactly. People can have cognitive consequences years later. And as I mentioned earlier, sometimes the complications can happen several weeks later. Sometimes people can have tears or what we call dissections in the arteries just from the mechanical force that's applied, and sometimes from that people don't have strokes until weeks later. So it really is much more than the immediate consequences of what we see. Obviously what captures media attention is deaths like the tragic deaths of George Floyd and Eric Garner, but we know from the medical standpoint that there are much longer-term consequences that are probably not being captured at all because of the lack of data and transparency about the technique.Rath: We're talking about this in the context of the police reform bill agreed to by Gov. Charlie Baker. In terms of that bill, which it looks like Baker is going to sign, are you happy with the language in it, in terms of how it addresses this? Do you think it's satisfactory? Saadi: I think it's important to point out that the death of Eric Garner, for example, occurred in the New York Police Deparment, which had prohibited the use of chokeholds. So my emphasis here would be that it's not just a matter of prohibition, of having the language about prohibiting some of these techniques, but really following that through with enforcement and accountability. That would be my hope here in Massachusetts as well \u2014 that yes, the first step is the bill, the first step is having language around this. But from there, we need the follow-through in terms of enforcement and accountability. Again, in the context of Eric Garner, that happened in a police department that had prohibited chokeholds.",

That's why in March, Superintendent of Schools Daniel Warwick \u2014 in partnership with the city of Springfield \u2014 set up 18 sites throughout the city to continue to provide meals three times a week, despite the pandemic.Warwick says typically the Springfield School District distributes roughly 30,000 meals on a weekly basis to students at public, private and charter schools in the area. Since March, the district has made and given out more than 5 million meals to families, including more than 95,000 just this past holiday weekend.\"We're a community with a high poverty rate.\" Warwick said. \"There's a great deal of food insecurity already, during normal circumstances. And you add in this pandemic, and we wanted to really do everything we could to help families get through this crisis.\"We also checked back in with Catherine D'Amato, president and CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank, about how the last nine months have been. Before the pandemic, one in 13 people were considered food insecure in the state, D'Amato said. Since March, that's increased to one in eight, with one in five being children.Click on the audio player above to listen to the full episode.Segments:Catherine D'Amato - 1:42Daniel Warwick - 15:54Correction: An earlier version of this post misidentified the name of the Springfield Superintendent of Schools.

      "body": "Data from Johns Hopkins University show that more than 63,000 people have died from COVID-19 in December alone, making it it the deadliest month of the pandemic so far. Meanwhile, frontline workers have been working day in and day out in an attempt to stay ahead of the virus, all while trying to keep themselves healthy. GBH News host Henry Santoro spoke with Brigham and Women's Hospital emergency room doctor Dr. Jeremy Faust about his experience working on the frontlines of the pandemic, and getting his first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Henry Santoro: Let's begin with the vaccine. Your Twitter followers all saw a photo of you getting your first shot last week. What do folks need to know about these vaccines? Dr. Jeremy Faust: The first thing that I think everyone should know and just be proud of is that in a year where science and public health really did not go well \u2014 we had a lot of disappointments and a lot of setbacks \u2014 that the vaccine story has been the bright star, the shining moment for us. In one year, [we] went from barely knowing anything about this virus to having a safe and effective vaccine that reduces the chances of getting symptoms and severely ill by an extraordinary amount. So that's the thing they need to know is that compared to the virus itself, the vaccine is extremely safe. And just in general, it's a wonderful achievement that this has been able to happen in such a short period of time. Santoro: It really is a scientific advancement of crazy proportions. But how did the vaccine affect you? Dr. Faust: I'll tell you, I could not wait to get my vaccine. I talked to a lot of people and everyone really reported to me very mild symptoms of anything \u2014 arm pain, a couple of body aches here and there. I had read all the trials that had said 15 percent or 20 percent of patients might have much worse symptoms, like it would knock them out for a day in terms of being at home not feeling well, you might have a flu-like illness. None of my colleagues had that, so then that had to be me; I had to be the one to have that. So I had 36 hours that was not the most pleasant and bounced back pretty quickly after that. And when I think about it, I think about the fact that what I experienced, which was body aches, a little bit of a fever and just feeling run down, that would have been the very beginning of what I would be feeling if I had actually gotten coronavirus. It went away in 36 hours after a little Tylenol. But if it had been the actual coronavirus, then it could have been days, weeks and months that I was laid out as opposed to just a few hours. So knowing what I know, I can't wait to get my second dose. Yeah, I'm going to clear my schedule for the next day anticipating that I could have a similar reaction, but I'm glad to know that I won't have to be on oxygen or be on a ventilator or worse. Santoro: I mentioned in my introduction to you, Dr. Faust, that December has been the deadliest month yet, with 63,000 people dying coast to coast from this virus. Are these deaths happening because people simply are not listening to what health officials are saying, they're not washing their hands [and] they're not wearing masks? That's a huge number for people dying in one month. Dr. Faust: It's a combination of people [not] listening entirely to the public health guidance [and] it's a little bit of [people] not necessarily ignoring it, but there's some degree of pandemic fatigue. They mean well, but it's just hard to keep this up for so long. That's one thing. Another thing I will say is that this virus really is difficult, and this new variant that you mentioned is a good example of that. It's more contagious, we believe. We don't know if it causes worse disease. I suspect it doesn't in a very meaningful way, but certainly more cases is always bad. So it's just a very difficult disease to control, largely because it can spread [and] it does spread among people who don't have symptoms, which is highly unusual for a respiratory virus. It's almost considered an adaptation. The idea that when you and I get sick, we have a fever or cough, we're not just having an immune response to fight off whatever invader is in our body, it's also a message to the people in our communities, \"hey, stay away from me. I'm a sick puppy right now.\" This virus kind of exploits that assumption and can spread despite the fact that we don't show those outward symptoms. So people who feel well are going about their business and because we don't have universal testing all the time, we can't pick up these cases. So I think this virus is just really difficult to control. Even when we try our best it's really hard, but there are countries around the world that have shown that if you really try, you can suppress it. Santoro: You have been at the forefront of this thing since it launched in March. It's got to be both physically and mentally draining. What do you do to keep yourself sane? Dr. Faust: Thanks for asking. I do feel that a lot of my colleagues are running a super marathon here. And what I would say is that at work, as long as we have PPE and as long as we have the medical equipment we need, we're pretty mission focused. We did sign up, literally, to do this work, so the opportunity to save lives or to help people is the same privileged opportunity that it was before COVID. Unfortunately, we just get more of a chance to do what we want to do, which is to help people. The part that I think is fatiguing is that we don't need to have been in such a bad situation. The number of deaths that you mentioned was not necessarily slated to happen; we could have held this back. And so the hard part is that you go to work, you do the best you can clinically and I think we're all proud of that work, and then many of us come home and we do other work, research or outreach to the public. The soul crushing part is when you see that despite all those efforts, people still are getting sick [and] some of our leaders undermine the messages. and that actually has really measurable consequences on the safety and the lives of our communities. So that's the part that I think is really hardest, to do all the work and feel like sometimes you have an uphill battle to get the right thing done. Santoro: And the message still is wash your hands [and] wear a mask, right? Dr. Faust: Absolutely. I think that the other one that I think sometimes gets lost in the shuffle is if you do decide to spend time with other people, it's not all or none. So if you did go somewhere for the Christmas break and you saw family, you shouldn't let the entire guard down. So wear masks as much as you can, even with the people that you're cavorting with, [and] keep the windows open. Instead of a five day week with the family, [do] two or three days. These things can make a huge difference because we are still learning about this virus. And I suspect that there are windows of time when infected people aren't that contagious and it may or may not correlate to symptoms that we're learning still. So the message really is that you can do many, many things that can decrease the chance of getting this virus or spreading it, especially with regard to travel. Just minimizing everything makes a huge difference. It's not all or none. ",

      "body": "Lawmakers are on the verge of expanding access to abortion in Massachusetts over objections from Gov. Charlie Baker about sections of their proposal involving minors seeking the procedure and abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy.With most House Democrats banding together, the House voted 107-46 on Monday to override the Republican governor's Christmas Eve veto of legislation (H 5179) reforming reproductive rights.The Senate adjourned Monday afternoon without tackling the matter, but plans to take up the bill on Tuesday, when it is expected to complete the override after voting several times in recent weeks to advance the bill.If the Senate follows suit as expected, state law would codify abortion rights, make abortions more accessible to 16- and 17-year-olds, and allow the procedure after 24 weeks of pregnancy in some cases.ModuleThe bill is based on measures that had strong support throughout the 2019-2020 session from members in both branches, but only gained traction after this year's elections and during lame duck sessions on Beacon Hill.For most of the two-year session, legislation referred to as the ROE Act sat before the Judiciary Committee untouched after a lengthy and heated hearing.Bill supporters raised the pressure to act on reproductive rights at the state level after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September and the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court, widely viewed as a step that could jeopardize the precedent set in Roe v. Wade.The legislation will enshrine abortion rights in state law, which backers argue is a crucial protection if the court changes any protections granted under Roe v. Wade, and will allow abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy in cases with a fatal fetal anomaly.It will also lower the age, from 18 to 16, at which individuals can seek an abortion without first receiving the consent of a parent or a judge.Supporters have said the existing threshold of 18 forces some teenagers -- who can legally consent to sex once they reach 16 -- either to face a potentially unsupportive family or the stigmatizing experience of going to court in order to get permission for an abortion.Baker said he supported several sections of the bill, including reforms to the judicial bypass system and eliminating the 24-hour waiting period for an abortion, but he bristled at reducing the age of consent by two years and sought more restrictive language around abortions after 24 weeks.\"I cannot support the sections of this proposal that expand the availability of late-term abortions and permit minors age 16 and 17 to get an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian,\" he wrote.His amendment would have scrapped lowering the age limit and would have changed the qualifying condition for an abortion after 24 weeks to when it is \"necessary, in the best medical judgment of the physician, to preserve the patient's physical or mental health,\" rather than to \"preserve the patient's physical or mental health\" as lawmakers proposed.Both branches rejected those suggested alterations, 107-50 in the House and 32-8 in the Senate. Baker in response vetoed the entire bill on Christmas Eve.After voting to approve the language as an amendment to the fiscal 2021 budget, to reject Baker's amendment and to re-enact the original bill, representatives had little left to say about the proposal: with no introduction or debate, they voted 107-46 on Monday -- surpassing the needed two-thirds majority to override.Only one Republican, Rep. James Kelcourse of Amesbury, supported the proposal.Sixteen Democrats cast votes against the override: Reps. Paul Donato, Brian Ashe, Linda Dean Campbell, Michael Finn, Colleen Garry, Russell Holmes, Christopher Markey, Joseph McGonagle, Paul McMurtry, Angelo Puppolo, David Robertson, John Rogers, Paul Schmid, Alan Silvia, RoseLee Vincent and Bud Williams.Democrat Rep. Marcos Devers voted present, while Reps. Carole Fiola, David Nangle, Thomas Petrolati and Angelo Scaccia did not vote.Baker's veto drew criticism from Democrats and reproductive rights activists.\"Charlie Baker's cowardice doesn't take a break for the holidays. Hoping that we would all be too busy to notice, Charlie Baker once again caved in to the extreme right-wing of his Republican Party by vetoing critical abortion access provisions that would put our laws in line with neighboring states like Maine, New York and Connecticut,\" Massachusetts Democratic Party Chair Gus Bickford said in response. \"Charlie Baker is choosing to stand with right-wing extremists, instead of doctors, women, and the vast majority of voters in Massachusetts.\"Within Baker's own party, the timing of the veto was also noted.\"Gov. Baker correctly recognized that this legislation simply goes too far, and he should be applauded for standing up and saying 'no' to the abortion lobby,\" said Massachusetts Republican Party Chair Jim Lyons, with whom Baker has clashed in the past. \"Gov. Baker's decision, made the day before millions celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, should send a message to the lawmakers that this legislation has no place in a humane society.\"Massachusetts Citizens for Life said it mobilized thousands of people since Thanksgiving to pressure Baker.\"Kill the bill, not the baby!\" said Fernando Limbo, a member of the group based in Revere. \"Even our pro-choice governor can see the harm in this bill, and thank God for this Christmas Eve gift protecting life.\"",

      "body": "With a thumbs up and a round of applause from staff, Air Force veteran Robert Aucoin on Tuesday became the first resident of the Holyoke Soldiers' Home in Massachusetts to get vaccinated against the coronavirus.\u201cGreat, great, leading the way,\" Aucoin, 78, said through his Snoopy mask after getting the first shot of the Pfizer vaccine.Aucoin, who has lived at the state-run home since 2018, served from 1961 to 1965 and worked as the control tower operator at Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina during his service, according to the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services.The state has made it a priority to get the residents of both the Holyoke facility and the Chelsea Soldier's Home vaccinated after the coronavirus tore through both state-run facilities for veterans who require long-term care in the spring.The Holyoke home had one of the country\u2019s deadliest virus outbreaks at a long-term care facility. Seventy-six residents died after contracting the virus in the spring and a 77th died earlier this month.More than 30 residents of the Chelsea home died after contracting the disease.An investigation into the Holyoke outbreak by a formal federal prosecutor hired by Gov. Charlie Baker found that management at the home made several \u201cutterly baffling\u201d decisions that helped the disease run rampant.Two former top administrators have pleaded not guilty to criminal negligence charges connected to the deaths.In Chelsea, World War II veteran Dominic Pitella, 94, was the first resident to be vaccinated.Pitella, a former corporal and cook with the 559th Air Service Group, served in the Pacific Theater during World War II starting in 1945. He has lived at the home since 2018, according to state officials.",

      "body": "As the sun set on his time in the Massachusetts House, Speaker Robert DeLeo took to the House floor one last time Tuesday to reflect on a three-decade Beacon Hill career that he said he tried to center around one overarching philosophy: that \"what this job is all about, very simply, is helping people.\"The Winthrop Democrat resigned from the House effective 6 p.m. Tuesday and hopes to soon begin working for his alma mater, Northeastern University. So with less than three hours left in his career as a representative, DeLeo stood at the lectern in the well of the House Chamber to address the body he has been a part of for 30 years and has led for the last 12 years.\"I stand before you with great humility. Sitting in my office last night for one of the last times, I thought back to the night before I was elected as speaker. I remember it was around dusk time and I was sitting back there ... and feeling immense gratitude that I would be leading this esteemed institution; an institution I had revered my entire career,\" DeLeo said. \"Sometimes it feels like those 12 years went by in an instant.\"In a 30-minute speech peppered with the kind of self-deprecating asides that endeared him to many of his colleagues, DeLeo thanked his family for staying at his side through \"both triumph and, well, less triumphant times,\" recognized staff members past and present, and reminded members of the House what the chamber was able to accomplish during his tenure as speaker.DeLeo pointed to gun safety legislation and health care cost reform laws that have become national models and said they represent \"the power of what we can achieve when we approach policymaking with open minds -- leaving behind entrenched ideas -- and a commitment to being a force for good.\"He thanked members of his leadership team for their work on major legislation, like Rep. Claire Cronin's work leading recent criminal justice reform efforts, Rep. Alice Peisch's role in passing a new education financing law last year, and Rep. Sarah Peake's work to guarantee protections for transgender individuals.\"During my years as speaker, the most impactful meetings I've had have been with young folks and families facing hardships, often in situations I couldn't relate to,\" he said. DeLeo added, \"As I look back, I can see the faces of the young people I've spoken to, their passion and their pain. And I know this, that this House made a difference.\"The speaker became most animated during his speech Tuesday when he talked about the pride he has in the House and each of its members, a section of the speech that was not in his remarks as prepared for delivery and that he appeared to deliver off the cuff.Speaker Robert DeLeo waved as he walked across the Mount Vernon Street archway to his car around 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, half an hour before his resignation took effect. [Sam Doran/SHNS]\"The thing I remember most is that to a person, each and every one of you spoke what you felt would help your district, what was important to the people of your district,\" he said. \"That is something I will never forget about each and every person in this chamber. You're all good people. And you all fought hard for the people in your district to make their life better. And I hope that people realize that.\"DeLeo left his office for the last time at 5:30 p.m. with several senior members of his staff, including chief of staff Seth Gitell and deputy chief of staff Whitney Ferguson. He was led down the Grand Staircase and into the Great Hall where his staff had set up a virtual meeting on a large-screen television with dozens of lawmakers who did not attend his farewell in person because of the pandemic.\"This is unbelievable,\" DeLeo said multiple times, thanking them for their partnership over the years.In a brief interview with the News Service afterward, DeLeo called it \"an emotional day,\" but said he was comfortable with his decision to step down.\"I can't say there was one thing in particular. I was proud of the work that we've done for so many years. I love this place. But on the other hand, now having grandchildren, I think, was one thing, and spending more time with the family was important to me at this point,\" he said.\"I felt that we accomplished quite a bit. I think when you feel it's the right time, you sort of know it's the right time,\" he added.DeLeo wouldn't say what he hoped to do at Northeastern University. \"That we'll let you know, but we're working on it,\" he said.A diehard Boston sports fan, DeLeo made annual trips to catch up with the Red Sox at spring training and was typically surrounded by a large cast of representatives at the Beanpot tournament each February. In his speech, he made frequent mention of his love for baseball, and also called attention to the success of the Patriots, Red Sox, Bruins and Northeastern Huskies during his tenure atop the House.\"Our sports teams have exceeded my wildest expectations. During my time as speaker, which I'll take credit for, we've seen six sports championships -- three Super Bowls, two World Series, and a Stanley Cup, and those trophies have all come to this chamber,\" he said. \"And let me not forget the multiple Beanpots that Northeastern University has won as well.\"He also addressed his presumed successor, Majority Leader Ron Mariano, directly. Mariano has been DeLeo's number two for a decade and has been part of leadership throughout DeLeo's tenure as speaker, often handling some of the most sensitive and complicated negotiations for the House.\"With your commonsense know-how and your understanding of how policies affect people, you have provided inordinate value to the House of Representatives. You are a tremendous friend and a wise counselor,\" DeLeo said to Mariano, who was seated nearby. \"Perhaps most importantly, in our three decades serving together ... I have witnessed you mentor many members. The House is better off because of your openness to the relationships that make the House what it is at its best. I want to thank you for that.\"Though DeLeo would sometimes give an agenda-setting speech to the House early in a new legislative session, it is unusual for the speaker to address the membership in full as he did Tuesday. Representatives who resign, retire or are otherwise leaving the House are typically given an opportunity to offer farewell remarks.DeLeo made his so-called maiden speech on the House floor 10,613 days earlier, on Dec. 9, 1991, while the House was debating a bill that dealt with full funding of public pension systems, according to News Service coverage of the session.The freshman representative from Winthrop spoke about the local aid his district had lost and the impacts as municipalities had to lay off employees. He mentioned a fire in Revere that damaged a home just 100 yards from where there was a firehouse before the city had to close it for lack of funding.\"When local aid is cut, it is the cities and towns that bleed,\" the News Service wrote in its summary of DeLeo's remarks.DeLeo alluded to his earliest days on Beacon Hill in his speech Tuesday, recalling how he arrived with \"a strong desire to represent my district\" and how an older member of the House once told him, \"Bob, you're not a selectman any more.\"Over the years, through conversations with representatives of different stripes -- like former Rep. Ellen Story of Amherst, whom DeLeo mentioned by name -- DeLeo said he learned the importance of listening to other members, learning about the issues in their districts and finding solutions that work across the state. He said he came to learn that \"central to the role of speaker is recognizing that each and every member, regardless of their political persuasion, is sent to Beacon Hill with the exact same mandate: To ably represent their 40,000 constituents.\"\"Throughout my tenure, I strove to listen deeply to my colleagues, keep an open mind, and identify solutions that work for the commonwealth -- from the Berkshires to Boston,\" DeLeo said. He added, \"And while our solutions may not receive accolades with those who want us to move faster or win the blessing of political pundits, our legislation fulfills the exact mandate I spoke of earlier. Our deliberative process results in laws that are representative of the diverse perspectives and needs of this great commonwealth's constituents.\"Though the Democrats who control the Massachusetts House will choose the next speaker, the constituents of the 19th Suffolk District, which includes Winthrop and part of Revere, will select their next representative during a yet-to-be-scheduled special election since DeLeo ran and won re-election last month but will not take office when the new Legislature is sworn in next Wednesday.Four Democrats have already filed papers with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance to run for the seat DeLeo is vacating: Juan Pablo Jaramillo, former legislative director for Sen. Joe Boncore; Tino Capobianco, chief of staff to Sen. Paul Feeney; Revere Beach Partnership President Jeffrey Turco; and Marc Silvestri, the director of veterans services in Revere.After concluding his remarks Tuesday, DeLeo shook the hand of Mariano, seated behind him, and fist-bumped Rep. Paul Donato, who listened to the speech from the rostrum.He then made his way over to Minority Leader Brad Jones, and the two men embraced. DeLeo then walked up the aisle to his office, bumping fists with some of the roughly two dozen members who attended the remote session in-person to witness his farewell speech, and hugged Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz.His made his exit from the chamber after choking up as he concluded his remarks.\"Finally, as I close I want to say thank you,\" DeLeo said. \"It's so hard to say goodbye to this place, and to the people with whom I've worked so closely and love, and to emphasize the word love because that's the way I feel today.\"",

      "body": "COVID-19 cases among incarcerated people at a state prison in Worcester County have spiked and one person has died, the state Department of Correction has confirmed. Twelve people in state prisons have died of COVID-19 related illness since the start of the pandemic, the spokesperson said. Cases of the virus at North Central Correctional Institution, more commonly known as Gardner, have more than tripled in the past week and are more than double any other state prison, according to DOC figures. There are now 142 active cases among incarcerated people at Gardner and 53 cases at Old Colony Correctional Center, the prison with the second highest number of infected imprisoned people. An attorney with a client at Gardner believes the Department of Correction is being deceptive about the number of COVID-19 positive cases within the facility. Attorney Margo Nash said one of her clients approached a nurse at the facility to report losing his taste and smell four days before he was tested. That result was positive for COVID-19 on Dec. 18, but it was weeks before the case was publicly reported by the DOC, Nash said. A spokesperson for the DOC said rapid test positivity is not publicly reported. Instead, the department relies on the more extensive PCR test, and reports those numbers. Nash finds fault with that practice. \u201cI think that's disingenuous because you can't consider someone negative who was initially tested positive with a rapid test which are being used everywhere,\u201d Nash said. Capacity at Gardner has had prison advocates fearful for months that COVID-19 cases there would spread quickly once inside, they told GBH News. Gardner\u2019s \u201cdesign capacity,\u201d defined as the number of incarcerated people planners intended for an institution, is the highest of any DOC facility, according to American Civil Liberties Union attorney Jessie Rossman. Garder was at 162 percent design capacity, according to a DOC report released in the second quarter of 2020. \"It's a unique, vulnerable setting because there are so many people in dormitory settings there and there isn't a lot of room to change that,\u201d said Elizabeth Matos, executive director of Prisoners' Legal Services. Saying it would allow for more social distancing inside prisons, advocates have been pushing for the state to release incarcerated peoples from the prison population. \u201cThe issue here is that people are dying as a result of failure to act,\u201d Matos said. \u201cAnd masks and hand sanitizer, just like what we're seeing in our own communities, is not enough to keep people safe.\u201d A spokesperson for the DOC declined to confirm the name of the incarcerated person held at Gardner who died but said the man was in his late 60s and died Monday at an \u201coutside hospital,\u201d after being admitted there Dec. 25. This story has been updated to include a comment from attorney Margo Nash.",

But for the 85-year-old Soillis, the shoe shop has also been a lifeline.Soillis estimates that he has lost 95% of his business since the coronavirus pandemic began in March. Still, he shows up every day, checks his inventory and waits for customers. To pass the time, he sits behind the counter in the front of the store and reads to practice his English. He\u2019s kept company by family photos, the shop\u2019s antique sewing machine and the organized clutter of leather pieces needed for repairs.\u201cLong story short, after I lost my wife I was really in a deep depression,\u201d said Soillis, whose wife died 15 years ago. \u201cAnd two, three times I was ready to [commit] suicide, so my kids pushed me to open the business [during the pandemic].\u201dSoillis grew up homeless in Greece. Until he met his American-born wife in Greece, he never expected to immigrate to the United States. He arrived in the 1960s. At first, Soillis and his wife lived in an attic without air conditioning. His father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law all lived in the same house. \u201c It was bad for everybody, but [not] for me,\u201d Soillis said. \u201cBecause my dream was, how can I do what my father told me? \u2018The United States if you a good person and you work hard and you\u2019re not a thief, you're honest, you [have] respect, you can make your life better here.\u2019\u201dThat background made Soillis determined to stay in business. Even before the pandemic, shoe repair shops were disappearing. Today, people often choose to replace old shoes, not repair them. In Harvard Square, there used to be several shoe shops. Now, Felix Shoe Repair is the last one that remains. \u201cIt's gonna\u2019 be a different life [for my kids],\u201d said Soillis. \u201cDifferent generations, different education. Yes, we have to live [with] what we have. That's the bottom line. The shop gave me life. That's all I can say. This shop. Harvard Square. The businesspeople. The people that trust me. I'm blessed. That's all I can say.\u201dDenise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, has known Soillis for 15 years and explained that he pays a lower rent since he is a long-time member of the business community.\u201cThe property owner knows the value that Christos brings to the square,\u201d Jillson said, \u201c[Soillis is] a very proud and dignified gentleman who wants to take care of himself, because he's always done that.\u201dSoillis explained how he and his wife never went out to dinner. He doesn't like to spend money at restaurants. Instead, his daughter and son bring him meals every week. It\u2019s a simple life, but Soillis said working at the shoe shop during the week and visiting his family on weekends has kept him going.\u201cAh, it doesn't matter how rich, how poor you grew up in countries like Greece, especially the old days,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a tough life.

      "body": "Massachusetts House Speaker Robert DeLeo's nearly 12 year tenure leading the chamber has come to an end. GBH State House reporter Mike Deehan discussed DeLeo's departure and his anticipated successor, House Majority Leader Ron Mariano, with GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: DeLeo is resigning to take an unspecified job at Northeastern University. That's where he went to college. Why is he leaving right now? Mike Deehan: For a number of reasons. Anybody who's been inside the State House bubble, so to speak, knows that it's long been rumored that DeLeo was going to depart at some point. It feels like for at least the latter half of his 12 years as speaker, those rumors have been going around, and different jobs have been stated. Northeastern was always one of them. He has a great fondness for his alma mater, Northeastern, and we're still not sure what kind of a job he's going to have there \u2014 whether it's going to be teaching or leading something. But he does love the Huskies, so we know that that's why he's going for that. Why now is because it really is towards the end of the legislature's work for the year. The big thing that they got done was the budget \u2014 and override votes to override the governor's vetoes from the budget, I should say. So that was really the window of opportunity that gave DeLeo the sign that now it is OK, we've done enough this session that he can depart. There's really not much else going on. There are some major bills that are still being worked out. But because the succession from DeLeo to House Majority Leader Ron Mariano seems to be going so smoothly, there'll be very little lack of continuity. So whatever work is needed to be done between now and Jan. 6, when the new legislature comes in, they will have the ability to get it done without getting bogged down. Rath: It sounds like he might have left sooner had these things not dragged on through the fall and into the winter. Deehan: Yeah, it really was the COVID-19 pandemic that kept him in office. These rumors came up in March. And then, when the pandemic hit, they kind of went away again. Now that that budget situation is done and things really are kind of taken care of, at least legislatively right now, it was a window of opportunity, and DeLeo took it.Rath: DeLeo is 70, and he's likely to be replaced by fellow Democrat and House Majority Leader Ron Mariano, who's 74. Like DeLeo, he's a white man. It doesn't feel like a generational shift. Is it strange that in the context of these times that there's not some younger, more diverse challenger? Deehan: Right. I know a lot of progressives and advocates in Massachusetts really did want to see the House go in a different direction. But right now, during this pandemic, because of this rather dire budget situation, I think that the House members definitely wanted to go with stability. Mariano represents, for them at least, stability and continuity right now. The 160 members of the House are the only voices that matter right now when selecting a speaker. Yes, there are some people that wanted to go for more diversity, or younger, or really anything other than an older white man, which is what all the speakers have been generally. I spoke to Marianao today, and he did say that he has diversity in mind. He says that that is a necessary thing for his leadership team, so he's going to try to put together the most diverse team he can. But this is where the House members are. They are comfortable with Mariano. He is very popular. Everyone tells me he has an open door policy that really appeals to everyone. Conservatives and progressives and moderates and everything in between all do kind of like this guy, even though there has been some criticism that he's DeLeo's number two and he's been kind of handed off the power here. So that's where Mariano's support comes from. Again, he's 74, so there's speculation that he might only be in the job for a term or two, though he's not putting any kind of a cap on how long he serves. I'm sure there'll be plenty of talk about what direction the speakership will go after that, but we're getting ahead of ourselves. Rath: It's interesting, hearing almost echoes of national politics, considering the criticism of Joe Biden's cabinet choices as not being progressive enough.Deehan: Right, exactly. Again, this is 160 members who have relationships with this guy, and they want to keep him around as their leader. There's plenty of time for someone of a different background or different stance politically to maybe make a move and become popular, but you don't get the fairly moderate Massachusetts House of Representatives to make you the speaker unless you're a fairly moderate representative yourself. So it would be kind of a longshot for a true progressive liberal to become the speaker. You really have to work a long time and play the game, so to speak, before you can get that kind of support. Rath: I remember reading your reporting that Rep. Russell Holmes of Mattapan was going to put up a challenge for the speakership. What happened with that? Deehan: He pulled back. He dropped out of the speaker's race. He did announce earlier that he was going to formally challenge Mariano, but even he admitted that he was not going to actually win this race. It was a symbolic gesture to do this run. Now he says he's dropping out because he doesn't want to complicate things. He wants the transition of power to be as smooth as possible, and he feels that he made his point by announcing it. He did tell me that he had a few people that were going to vote for him, but he didn't really want to damage them on the way down, so to speak. But he did talk to Mariano. They don't agree on everything, obviously, but Holmes did tell me that he will support Mariano on Wednesday when they meet to vote for the new speaker. So it's really a unified front among the Democrats right now, and that is kind of what the speaker's job is \u2014 to bring people in line like that and be on the same page. Rath: Pulling back and taking a wide view of DeLeo's very long tenure as speaker, tell us a bit about what you think his legacy is going to be.Deehan: When it comes to Speaker DeLeo, over those 12 years, basically everything state government did, DeLeo had a hand in one way or another \u2014 or at least every law that was written. I've been describing it as incremental progressive legislation. That's kind of the DeLeo M.O. He demanded wide support from virtually every Democrat before he would bring something to the floor. So everything was worked out behind the scenes. Everyone knew it was going to pass by a huge margin. The floor votes were never in doubt, and it was pushed through that way. Everybody was satisfied, at least. But if everyone's satisfied, that means that some folks aren't as happy as they would have been. Some people said that this caused weaker legislation, watered down legislation to appeal to progressives or to appeal to moderates or conservatives, to get everyone on that same page in order to keep the system going. He had a very tight grip on the membership. His team of chairmen and leaders really did enforce discipline when it came to these votes and that kind of search for consensus. By the same token, people say that DeLeo was always open behind closed doors. He was open to speaking with everyone and really getting to what the membership wanted. Again, it's a moderate body, and it's going to have moderate results. So those kind of compromises were necessary to get things through. When it comes to specific issues, things like casinos \u2014 gun control was a huge DeLeo priority. Bringing transgender rights, that was something that came incrementally over those 12 years, a bill here and a bill there as members of the House were ready to take on changes like that. There were a few tax hikes over the years, the sales tax and the gas tax. But generally, DeLeo was seen as having pleased the employer base of the economy and employers. That employment rate is really where DeLeo's focus was. Ambitious legislation and reforms could only come after the functioning of the economy, from his point of view.",

      "body": "Updated 5:52 p.m.The rest of the 2020s need to be \"the decade for action\" on climate change and energy policy if Massachusetts is to meet its mid-century greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, and that will require sweeping changes in the ways that people in Massachusetts heat their homes, get to work and around town, and generate electricity, the Baker administration said Wednesday.The Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs released its 2050 Decarbonization Roadmap and draft 2030 Clean Energy and Climate Plan on Wednesday to put some meat on the bones of the decarbonization framework Gov. Charlie Baker laid out in January when he accelerated the state's efforts and threw his support behind a net-zero target for 2050 emissions.Between the two reports, the administration laid out possible pathways towards that 2050 target but also set a new goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent from 1990 levels by 2030. To get there over the next decade, Massachusetts needs to retrofit more than one million homes and more than 350 million square feet of commercial space with better insulation and heat pumps, reduce commuter vehicle miles traveled by 15 percent, begin to phase out gas-powered cars and trucks, and start getting clean power from the hydroelectric and offshore wind projects already in the pipeline.\"After analyzing multiple pathways to net-zero, we're confident that Massachusetts has the ability to achieve our ambitious 2050 climate goals and if we're smart about the approach we take and the strategies that we select, we can do so affordably and equitably while maintaining a thriving economy and ensuring that we bring everyone along, especially our most vulnerable residents,\" Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Kathleen Theoharides said.While the new plan lays out a path to cut emissions, some of the policies to help get there remained bogged down Wednesday in a House-Senate conference committee. That panel was charged over the summer with coming up with a consensus bill, but has only until Tuesday to wrap up, or else lawmakers will need to start over again.Theoharides said her office found that the most cost-effective and low-risk paths to net-zero emissions by 2050 include a balanced portfolio of clean energy generation that is \"anchored by a significant offshore wind resource,\" greater interstate transmission abilities so clean power produced elsewhere can be delivered to Massachusetts, and widespread electrification of transportation and building heating.Massachusetts lost ground in its latest report on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but a Baker administration official said Wednesday that the state remains on track to meet the 2020 requirement of a 25 percent reduction from 1990 emissions levels. The administration in October released an update to the Massachusetts Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory which showed emissions in 2018 were 22.2 percent below emissions in 1990, compared to 2017 emissions that were 22.7 percent below 1990 levels.Peter Rothstein, president of the Northeast Clean Energy Council, welcomed the administration's reports and said his organization looks forward to \"helping to translate these plans into policies and programs\" in the new year.\"These reports detail considerable analysis and thoughtful planning undertaken by the Baker-Polito Administration, and we applaud Governor Baker and Secretary Theoharides for taking these important steps to lay the foundation for how Massachusetts will achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and interim goals by 2030,\" he said. \"With today's announcement of a new target of 45 percent emission reductions by 2030, the Administration is taking an aggressive leadership position for the Commonwealth and the Northeast.\"The Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which has been part of the Global Warming Solutions Act implementation, said it was \"pleased to see the Administration making commitments to decarbonize our homes and businesses, connect our communities to renewable and clean sources of energy, and make carbon-free modes of transportation accessible for all. These transitions across all sectors of the Massachusetts economy are fundamental to ensuring an equitable and resilient net zero emissions future for the state.\"The New England Power Generators Association said the analysis is \"important in laying out a vision for the future, but it does not tell us how to get there.\" The organization that represents fossil fuel plants as well as solar generators said it stands ready to help the state transition but offered two guiding thoughts.\"First, we must internalize the costs of climate change into the economy to support new investments and guide consumer choices. That should be done through putting a meaningful price on carbon emissions in the electricity, transportation, and heating industries,\" Dan Dolan, president of NEPGA, said. \"Second, the New England electricity markets should be improved to better account for the services that will be needed in this changing economy. That will ensure that power plants needed to maintain reliability \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while meeting our climate responsibilities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are kept around.\"The administration's latest plan calls for a requirement that all new cars and passenger trucks sold in Massachusetts be zero-emission vehicles starting in 2035, new long-term declining emissions caps for heating fuels like natural gas and oil, scaling up offshore wind generation by more than 15 times from the 1,600 megawatts already under contract to 25 gigawatts by 2050, the creation of a new net-zero stretch building energy code, and more.Passenger cars are currently responsible for about 27 percent of statewide emissions and that number \"will need to be reduced to nearly zero\" by 2050, the administration said in the 2050 roadmap, but the current pace of electric vehicle adoption lags what is necessary. Meeting the 2030 reduction target \"would require that about 1 million of the 5.5 million [passenger vehicles] projected to be registered in the Commonwealth in 2030 be\" zero-emission vehicles.Currently, the administration said, there are about 30,000 zero-emission and hybrid vehicles registered in Massachusetts but officials said their plan is not reliant on a sudden and dramatic breakthrough in electric vehicle technology, but rather the regular technological progress that the automotive industry has already displayed around electric vehicles.Getting to 1 million electric vehicles by 2030 and then shifting to exclusively electric vehicle sales by 2035 will also require Massachusetts to build out a charging infrastructure that will give people the confidence to use a battery-powered car.\"Helping to ensure that consumers have access to charging, personal charging, is critical and this is particularly challenging for folks in apartment buildings who may not have garage space or designated parking. And so that's a challenge we'll continue to be working on,\" Theoharides said. \"The other piece of this is the public charging and ensuring that there is build-out of fast chargers along highways, of charging stations in rural locations and throughout the state, and that's something we'll also be continuing to work on over the next decade.\"Though the administration wants more people driving electric vehicles, simply moving away from internal combustion engines won't be enough to wring the necessary reductions out of the transportation sector, which as a whole accounts for 42 percent of the state's emissions. To get to the 2030 target, Massachusetts needs to reduce the average number of miles a worker commutes by car by 15 percent, which officials said would be roughly equal to reducing statewide vehicle miles traveled by about four percent.When the COVID-19 pandemic first hit and many workers stopped making daily trips to and from the office, Massachusetts saw a 50 percent drop in statewide vehicle miles traveled and that has since climbed back to about 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels, officials said.\"We really believe that that teleworking is something that is going to stay with us, even after the pandemic,\" the secretary said, adding that the state was looking into offering tax credits or subsidies to promote teleworking before the pandemic. \"I think the question we'll be looking at now is whether that tax subsidy is needed or whether everyone now recognizes how much telework is a viable, often very productive, way to work and so we actually think that teleworking may be here to stay without any additional incentives.\"Offshore wind is poised to play a major role in Massachusetts' net-zero efforts. Already, Massachusetts utilities have contracted for about 1,600 MW through the Vineyard Wind and Mayflower Wind projects and the Legislature has authorized the Baker administration to seek 1,600 MW more -- Theoharides said the administration could issue another request for proposals for more offshore wind power \"in the near future.\"Those two projects, which remains years away, must be generating electricity for Massachusetts to meet the 2030 target, but the secretary said that the 2050 goal of net-zero emissions will require a lot more wind energy.\"Offshore wind is an absolutely critical part of a low-cost strategy to achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we're looking at something on the order of 25 [gigawatts] of offshore permitted and operating off of our coasts,\" she said. She added, \"We look forward to efforts to work with the incoming administration to ensure the two projects -- the Vineyard Wind project and the Mayflower Wind project -- that we have in the pipeline get permitted and built expeditiously, and that we can work with the administration on the siting of new lease areas that balance environmental impacts with this great energy resource we have off our coasts.\"Theoharides also pitched the indirect benefits of the state's decarbonization efforts Wednesday and said there is something in the plan for everyone.\"The roadmap finds that achieving net-zero emissions will deliver significant benefits to residents across the commonwealth,\" the secretary said. \"This includes a precipitous drop in air pollution, particularly in environmental justice communities currently overburdened with poor air quality ... We also see savings in health costs of up to $100 million per year by 2030 and the creation of thousands of high-quality local jobs.\"",

      "body": "Ahead of New Years Eve, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh warned would-be revelers that Boston police will be onhand to respond to calls for unruly parties. Walsh, who was joined by Police Commissioner William Gross during a press conference at City Hall on Wednesday, said police responding to calls for loud noise or large gatherings will likely begin by asking hosts to \u201cshut down.\u201d \u201cI want to ask people to not have New Year\u2019s Eve parties this year in order not to spread the virus,\u201d Walsh said, pointing to the city\u2019s latest increase of 569 new COVID-19 cases. He added that if the party violates the city\u2019s current 10-person capacity limit, authorities will be notified. \u201cHopefully people cooperate,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIf need be, we will have police knocking on doors and asking people to shut down. But I guarantee you the police will be giving those addresses to Inspectional Services, and we\u2019ll probably be writing violations if there\u2019s more than 10 people in that house.\u201dThe heightened vigilance comes as Boston surpassed 1,000 COVID-19 related deaths since the pandemic gripped the city in the spring. The toll, Walsh said Wednesday, now stands at 1,008 lives lost.Walsh said small gatherings are still a major source of increasing COVID-19 activity as more and more people have traveled to spend time with friends and loved ones for the holidays despite public health officials urging against such visits. More people are hospitalized for COVID-19 now than in June, Walsh said, and to that end, residents have a role to play in protecting one another from further virus spread as the city rings in the new year and awaits public vaccine distribution. \u201cI know that a lot of people, all of us, are tired of living with the virus. It\u2019s tempting to let out guards down during this holiday season, but the virus is still very much with us,\u201d Walsh said, acknowledging the grim figure. \u201cWhen New Years Day comes around, [it] does not mean the virus goes away.\u201dGross said all 11 of the Boston Police Department\u2019s districts will be fully staffed into tomorrow evening with reinforcements in anticipation of the party calls. \u201cWe will be out there,\u201d Gross said, explaining the extra staffing. \u201cYou will lose no coverage in your neighborhoods, and we just ask everyone to listen to what the mayor said.\u201dWalsh, who still has not officially declared a third term re-election campaign, also declined to state his intentions for next year when asked by reporters about speculation that he might leave the city\u2019s executive seat for a spot in the Biden administration. The mayor said he had not spoken to anyone from the Biden teamor the president-elect himself since shortly after the November election.Asked whether his ambition might lead him to take a position within the Biden administration, Walsh flashed a wide smile and said, \"I love being the mayor of Boston.\"",

      "body": "As the year and legislative session come to a close, Gov. Charlie Baker on Thursday signed into law legislation creating a police accountability and oversight system under which officers need to be certified every three years and can lose their certification for violating to-be-developed policing standards.As the country reacted to the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police officers this summer, policing reform was catapulted to the top of Beacon Hill's priority list and lawmakers set out on what would become a complicated, circuitous and, at times, controversial path to address police violence and some of the disproportionate impacts communities of color experience from law enforcement, and to bolster the state's oversight of police officers.Seven months later, after heated debates, public outcry from police unions, back-room negotiations, a veto threat, and more negotiations, Baker made the reforms state law.\"This bill is the product of bipartisan cooperation and thanks to the Black and Latino Caucus' leadership on the hugely important issue of law enforcement accountability, Massachusetts will have one of the best laws in the nation,\" Baker said. \"Police officers have enormously difficult jobs and we are grateful they put their lives on the line every time they go to work. Thanks to final negotiations on this bill, police officers will have a system they can trust and our communities will be safer for it.\"At the heart of the new law is the creation of the Massachusetts Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission as an independent state entity with the power to establish policing standards, certify law enforcement officers, investigate allegations of misconduct, and suspend or revoke the certification of officers who are found by clear and convincing evidence to have violated its standards.The duties of the state's existing municipal police training committee will remain under the administration's Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, the result of a compromise intended to ensure the governor would sign the bill.The so-called POST Commission will be composed mostly of civilians -- the governor will appoint a police chief, a retired Superior Court judge and a social worker chosen from a list of five nominations submitted by the local chapter of the National Association of Social Workers; the attorney general will appoint a law enforcement officer below the rank of sergeant, a law enforcement officer chosen from five nominations by the Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers, and an attorney selected from five nominations from the Civil Rights and Social Justice Section Council of the Massachusetts Bar Association; and the governor and attorney general will jointly appoint three others, one of whom must be chosen from five names recommended by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.\"There's no other supervisory board in the country like this one with the extent of power that it has to monitor, to directly discipline and to hear complaints directly,\" Sen. Will Brownsberger, a Belmont Democrat who negotiated the compromise version, said in late November. \"It's a majority civilian board. Almost all of the rest of the boards in the country are all law enforcement, so this is a very, very strong innovation.\"The Massachusetts Coalition of Police, which represents 4,300 uniformed law enforcement officers in the state, opposed much of the bill and said that Baker signing it would represent him \"changing the police profession in Massachusetts forever.\" MassCOP said, \"a lack of proper examination and study into a number of crucial portions of this bill will result in collateral damage that will have a negative impact on many of our communities.\"The law puts some guardrails around law enforcement's use of force, prohibiting the use of chokeholds, requiring the use of de-escalation tactics before physical force, and establishing limits on the use of rubber bullets, tear gas and dogs. It also requires that an officer intervene in most situations if he or she sees another officer using unnecessary physical force and to report that use of force up the chain of command.It also explicitly bans law enforcement agencies from engaging in racial profiling and restricts the use of no-knock warrants by requiring that they be issued by a judge only if the requesting affidavit includes probable cause that the life of the officer or the life of another person would be endangered if the officer announced themselves and includes an attestation from the requesting officer that there is no reason to believe minor children or adults older than 65 are present in the home.\"This is a landmark decision that begins to address the inequities that we have seen in our police institutions for a long time,\" Rep. Carlos Gonzalez, who chairs the Black and Latino Legislative Caucus and was one of the six conference committee members who negotiated the final product, said. \"Like everybody has said, one bill is not going to address every issue, but we are confident that this bill starts to begin the process of holding police accountable in a transparent way and having an independent body investigate police misconduct when and if it occurs.\"When lawmakers initially sent the bill to Baker, it called for a ban on almost all law enforcement use of facial recognition systems, only allowing police to ask the Registry of Motor Vehicles to perform a search with a warrant or if there is \"an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury.\"The governor threatened a veto over concerns about that prohibition and other aspects of the legislative compromise, and lawmakers soon scaled back the facial recognition prohibition to allow police to perform facial recognition searches to assist with criminal cases or to mitigate \"substantial risk of harm\" after submitting a written request to the RMV, Massachusetts State Police, or the Federal Bureau of Investigation.A legislative commission, including members from both civil rights groups and police agencies, will also study the topic of facial recognition and make recommendations for additional regulations by the end of 2021.The new law also includes provisions Baker outlined about a year ago when he proposed a series of reforms around the State Police, including the authority for a governor to appoint someone from outside the MSP ranks as colonel of the force and the creation of a cadet program as an alternate route to the State Police Academy that the administration believes can diversify the pool of recruits.Though not specific to the State Police, it also establishes a fine of three times the fraudulently-earned wages or imprisonment of up to two years for any law enforcement officer who knowingly submits a fraudulent timesheet. Nearly 50 active or retired troopers who patrolled the Massachusetts Turnpike as part of the since-dissolved Troop E were implicated in an overtime fraud scheme in which they collected pay for shifts they did not work or did not finish roughly from 2015 to 2017.Ahead of the Senate's final vote on the package, Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz said that there were \"a lot of mixed emotions\" about the package and suggested that some matters not resolved could return for more discussion in the 2021-2022 legislative session that begins next week.\"There is a lot of mourning that I and others are doing for the things not included in this bill,\" she said. \"But at the end of the day, when I zoom out and I look at what this bill accomplishes relative to what anyone would have expected twelve months ago or six months ago or even six days ago, there is a ton in this bill that is really going to set a new standard for the national policy landscape on police accountability that could potentially ripple through the other forty-nine states.\"On Thursday, after Baker signed the bill into law, Chang-Diaz said, \"This law represents a mile-marker, not an end.\"",

      "body": "As Gov. Charlie Baker wraps up the year by signing the police reform bill, the new law is receiving mixed reviews by legislators and civil rights advocates who say more needs to be done to protect vulnerable communities.State Sen. Sonia Chang-D\u00edaz, who was one of the bills sponsors, said the law is a \u201cmile-marker,\u201d but not an end to an ongoing fight against racism in policing. While she praised the bill for banning chokeholds, banning racial profiling and limiting no-knock warrants, Chang-Diaz added there is more work to be done to combat systematic racism.\u201cNo one bill will dismantle structural racism \u2014 in policing, or in all the other places it exists,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cAs much as we celebrate these hard-won steps forward today, we must equally resolve to keep walking the road of racial justice in 2021.\" In a subsequent interview, Chang-Diaz said it's shocking that some of the reforms took so long to accomplish.\u201cWhen I say a mile marker, it\u2019s a huge mile marker, a huge step forward in in the push for accountability and for justice in law enforcement,\" she said. \"But it is also a heartache, for the things that that we had to push so hard and fight so hard for that should have been an easy yes that weren't included in the bill. So it really is both a victory and a call to continued organizing.\u201dThe law comes after protesters and activists demanded throughout the summer that legislators and public officers examine the role of policing and the intersection of racism and systemic violence following the deaths of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky last March and George Floyd in Minneapolis last May.The new law creates a mandatory certification process for police officers and \u201cgenerally precludes\u201d officers from using rubber pellets, chemical agents or canine units against a crowd. It will also establish four permanent commissions on the status of African Americans, Latinos and Latinas, people with disabilities, and the social status of Black men and boys.\u201cThis bill is the product of bipartisan cooperation and thanks to the Black and Latino Caucus\u2019 leadership on the hugely important issue of law enforcement accountability, Massachusetts will have one of the best laws in the nation,\u201d said Baker. \u201cPolice officers have enormously difficult jobs and we are grateful they put their lives on the line every time they go to work. Thanks to final negotiations on this bill, police officers will have a system they can trust and our communities will be safer for it.\u201d The bill, known as \u201cAn act relative to justice, equity and accountability in law enforcement in the Commonwealth,\u201d was amended by Baker to strengthen due process protections for law enforcement, include police labor representation on the commission, and bolster controversial facial recognition provisions, which Baker calls \u201clifesaving tools\u201d in his statement. State Rep. Russell Holmes of Mattapan, who also sponsored the legislation, called the law \u201can important step\u201d forward after the deaths of Floyd and Taylor led to massive marches against police brutality in Massachusetts and across the country.\u201cFor too long, Black and Latino communities have been demanding change and accountability when it comes to policing in our communities and across the Commonwealth,\u201d Holmes said in a statement. \u201cWhile we are glad this bill is now signed into law, we must now also reflect on the importance of this fight, and resolve to build on these reforms in the future.\u201dCarol Rose, executive director of the Massachusetts ACLU, echoed that sentiment.\u201cThis is a compromise bill. While it lacks many of the protections advocated by both civil rights and community leaders, it also includes key provisions that will save lives, advance civil rights, and safeguard liberties,\u201d Rose said in a statement. \u201cThe new law lays the groundwork for the legislature to enact additional civil rights and civil liberties protections in the upcoming legislative session, and the public pressure for change will continue.\u201dChief Edward A. Dunne, President of the Massachusetts Chief of Police Association, said his members are \u201ceager to turn the page on what has been an unprecedented and incredibly difficult and enduring year on so many different levels,\u201d in a statement. \u201cWe are extremely confident that this comprehensive legislation signed into law by the Governor today will serve to renew an elevated sense of faith, confidence, and trust that the residents of the Commonwealth will have in their law enforcement agencies across the state.\u201d ",

      "body": "Since Thanksgiving, Dr. Holly Oh has been tackling a trend at her community health center in Dorchester: So many people are booking pre-travel COVID-19 appointments that it has become nearly impossible for patients with symptoms or who have come in contact with a positive case to schedule a test. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite maddening,\u201d Oh, the medical director at the Dimock Community Health Center, told GBH News. \u201cWe've had to sort of juggle around and try to figure out how we're going to book people who actually have symptoms. We look at the schedule, and there\u2019s all these pre-travel and pre-holiday gathering requests.\u201d Oh says she\u2019s had to do \u201call sorts of machinations\u201d to give community members needed access to testing, and in an ideal world, testing would be available to anyone, at any time, for any reason. \u201cI think some of it is also just because we, the big \u2018we,\u2019 the state, haven't been able to ramp up the testing accessibility quick enough, fast enough, broadly enough across different communities,\u201d Oh said. Still, knowing that pre-travel tests are making testing inaccessible for people who are potentially actively spreading the virus is frustrating, Oh says. \u201cThese testing sites are now getting filled up with, you know, hey, I'm going to go visit my grandma, so I'm going to get a test before I go and so forth,\u201d Oh said. \u201cWe certainly don't want to deny people tests, because those still hold important spots in controlling the transmission. But right now, it's actually been to the detriment of the community members who actually have symptoms or who have close contacts.\u201d While some health centers prevent anyone without symptoms or close contact with a positive case from getting a test, Oh says Dimock is one of several community health facilities that wanted to take a more open approach, making testing as available as possible. \u201cWe've made it so easy to access our health center that it sometimes leaves the folks who actually have symptoms living in tight quarters in Roxbury, and it's actually making it more difficult for them,\u201d Oh said. \u201cIt's hard to get them a spot because it's been filled up by folks who are traveling.\u201d Dimock mainly serves the communities of Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan, Jamaica Plain and Hyde Park. The facility also contains a residential shelter and on-site substance use resources. Oh says it\u2019s important to keep the door open to those communities for testing \u2014 but that shouldn\u2019t include travelers from outside the area looking to get a pre-holiday test to meet a state travel order restriction. \u201cWe need that access in other communities within the commonwealth, too, so that, you know, folks from Wellesley, if they\u2019re going to plan a ski trip to Vermont, can get their test in Wellesley \u2014 they don\u2019t have to travel all the way to Roxbury, to my health center, to get it,\u201d Oh said. \u201cEveryone really should be able to access testing easily in their own community.\u201d Massachusetts will receive $452.1 million to expand COVID-19 testing, tracing and mitigation as part of the state\u2019s $9 billion federal stimulus share. Though the Health and Human Services Department has not officially announced how the millions will be specifically allocated, Gov. Charlie Baker has announced new infrastructure for testing across the state. \u201cAs we enter the winter months, testing will be a crucial measure to prevent COVID,\u201d Baker said at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cBut folks need to keep in mind that testing only represents a moment in time, and there are several other prevention measures that we must all practice every day.\u201d Testing sites will be expanded into New Bedford, Framingham and Lynn, with new sites that will test at least 1,000 individuals per day, according to Baker\u2019s office. The state also plans to use $550,000 in state funds to open testing sites across Western Mass and the Cape and Islands, in addition to expanding free testing with a mobile provider in Franklin County. Massachusetts has so far allocated more than $150 million for free COVID-19 testing, including surveillance testing programs and investments in laboratory capacity to process samples. Approximately 91,400 individuals are tested weekly at 50 Stop the Spread sites across the state. \u201cMassachusetts has some of the best testing in the country,\u201d Oh said. \u201cWe're one of the better ones, but it's still too difficult. If we\u2019re setting up these testing sites so quickly and making the barrier so low for residents of Roxbury and Dorchester and so forth, and now they're getting crowded out, like, what solutions do we have here?\u201d Oh says the answer is to expand testing \u2014 but that process requires so much more than just money. \u201cIt's hard to expand testing on a dime,\u201d Oh said. \u201cIts staffing. Its resources. It's, you know, people sometimes may not realize it's not just the sticking the swab up the nose. While the funds are still needed, there are still so many pieces to do to expand it, and it\u2019s not going to be an overnight thing.\u201d ",

      "body": "2020 was a busy year for infectious disease physicians. And as 2021 begins with hospitals already packed with COVID-19 patients, several doctors from Massachusetts hospitals say they worry infections from holiday gatherings will crowd ICUs even more.\"We're all sort of bracing ourselves,\" said Dr. Erica Shenoy, associate chief of the infection Control Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"What is it going to look like two weeks from now?\"Doctors say they expect a surge of hospitalizations to follow a spike in new infections by about two weeks. \"We are expecting to have a bump,\" said Dr. Cassandra Pierre, acting hospital epidemiologist at Boston Medical Center. \"I don't know if it will be as dramatic as it was after Thanksgiving. Our airport travel tells us that it could certainly be as bad.\"Right now, Pierre said, BMC projects it will have the capacity to meet the added demand. \"I'm hoping that that continues to hold true, and that we are not surprised this time,\" she said.Boston Medical Center, MGH and other hospitals around Massachusetts still aren't seeing anywhere close to the number of COVID-19 patients they cared for during the initial surge in the spring. At MGH, Shenoy said, they had about 125 COVID-19 patients on New Year's Eve, compared to about 400 during the peak in the spring.But as the new year begins, the state is setting records for newly reported infections. The Department of Public Health reported nearly 6,900 confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday, beating the previous all-time high set in early December. The DPH reports 190 communities, including Boston, are in the state's high risk \"red zone.\" And if those numbers continue to climb, a surge of hospitalizations could follow.\"We could be seeing in a few weeks a very significant shortage of resources to take care of not just patients with COVID,\" said Dr. Shira Doron, hospital epidemiogist at Tufts Medical Center. \"We can't forget that this is not about caring for COVID. This is about caring for absolutely anybody who needs medical care of any kind.\"And an influx of patients could hamper the ability of hospitals to provide important care to other patients. At Tufts Medical Center, other medical units have already been converted into areas for adult COVID-19 patients.\"We are not business as usual right now in terms of our patient care operations,\" Doron said. \"We have already expanded into nontraditional areas.\"In early December, hospitals were ordered by Gov. Charlie Baker to scale back elective procedures, but they're still providing more care than they were able to during the initial surge. In the spring, Shenoy said, many patients delayed necessary care.\"And as as much as we obviously are doing everything we can to to manage the COVID volume, the other part is to manage everything else ... and ensure that there's not harm that results from people staying away, and to make sure that we care for those who come to our door,\" Shenoy said. \"I mean, that's the mission here.\"Hospital capacity is particularly tight right now in the northeastern part of the state, where the Massachusetts DPH reported Thursday there were just 9% of ICU beds currently available and only 8% of non-ICU beds free.\"We are concerned about the impact of the holidays \u2014 both Christmas and now New Years \u2014 in contributing to a surge upon the existing surge,\" said Dr. David Longworth, president of Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington.Longworth said he believes the lack of available hospital beds in the northeastern part of the state is the result of greater community spread of the virus in that region.As 2020 drew to a close, infectious disease physicians looked back with a mixture of awe and disbelief. It was a \"momentous year,\" Longworth said. He's been an infectious disease physician since the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s.\"So I've spent a lot of time in health care,\" he said. \"And this is the most consequential year in health care, in my opinion, in the last century. What we have lived through has been truly remarkable.\"Longworth remarked on the scientific community's ability in just one year to identify the virus, genetically sequence it, and develop tests and effective therapies for it, as well as the creation of vaccines.\"That's a remarkable story, and it's a story that would not have happened five years ago or 10 years ago,\" he said.The past year was also an exhausting year for those in healthcare.\"It's been incredibly intense, and I think everyone's very tired,\" Shenoy said. \"But I think we have a lot to be proud of for the last year \u2014 and a lot of lessons learned that we're even applying now to the second surge, to do things better. I am really, really hopeful for 2021 and really grateful for all the hard work that people have put in across all different sectors.\"For Pierre, the new vaccines bring a feeling of optimism.\"It is the first bright spot that we have had on the horizon for quite some time,\" she said. That's been tempered a bit, though, she said, \"given that the rollout has been slower than we have expected nationally, and also in Massachusetts.\"And, she pointed out, it will take as much as 72% of the population to be vaccinated before we can reach herd immunity.\"I think that there will be some time before we are able to achieve those numbers, unfortunately,\" she said.",

      "body": "Since early December, Daniel P. Matthews, a Needham select board member, has been knocking on doors in a community far from home. After the Nov. 3 election, Mathews packed a suitcase and his favorite music and headed to Georgia to take part in a nationwide effort to help two Democratic candidates for Senate win run-off elections.On Tuesday those races \u2014 pitting incumbent Republican U.S. Sens. David Purdue and Kelly Loeffler against Democrats Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, respectively \u2014 finally come to a head. Both President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden are scheduled to be in the state Monday to campaign on behalf of their parties\u2019 favorites.Biden narrowly won the state in November with fewer than 12,000 votes. Polls suggest both Senate races are too close to call, though Republicans have enjoyed an historical advantage in turnout for run-off elections. If Democrats win both races, they will win back control of the U.S. Senate, which is why volunteers and operatives from Massachusetts have joined activists from around the nation to flood into the state.Matthews is not part of the official Massachusetts Democratic Party effort to win the two Senate seats there. He is spending his own time and money on the effort. Speaking to GBH News from his hotel in Gwinnet County, Matthews  \u2014who describes himself as a \u201cmoderate Democrat\u201d \u2014 said he feared that Republicans would sweep the two run-off races if folks like him don't get personally involved. \"I was particularly concerned during the general election that I felt that when the Republicans went to in-person campaigning and COVID denial, they did a lot of damage to public health. But it gave them a big advantage,\" Matthews said. \"When the Democrats began campaigning COVID-safe door-to-door here in Georgia, I thought I should put my money where my mouth is.\" He said that he has been on the ground since the beginning of December. Leonard Lee has also been on the ground in Georgia. On Dec. 14, he joined a 20-car caravan esorted by a squadron of local police cruisers through poor and working-class Black neighborhoods in Savannah, encouraging folks to head to the polls on that first day of early voting.  Lee described the two-hour event as celebratory and joyous. \"People came out waving at us, we were passing out masks, people were saying, \u2018I voted, I voted, I'm going today. I'm going,'\" Lee said. \"I mean, just the enthusiasm. We had people coming down from Chicago, Detroit. It was just amazing.\u201d Lee said the day's event was topped off with a fish fry in 70 degree weather.Lee, a public health specialist and former director of child and youth violence prevention at Massachusetts Department of Public Health, was in Georgia as part of a volunteer effort by the Transformative Justice Coalition to turn out the vote. The groups is a nationwide, non-partisan organization focused on stopping voter suppression. Lee says he agreed to provide masks and other protection for voters heading to the polls. He was joined on the ground in Georgia by former state Sen. Dianne Wilkerson, who was tapped to lead a telephone operation.\u201cAs we say, I was 'volun-told' to serve as the chair of the Phone Banking Committee,\" Wilkerson said. \"We have now over a thousand people making calls into Georgia every day.\u201d The outreach to Georgia by the Transformative Justice Coalition is complimented by similar virtual phone banking initiatives launched by the Massachusetts Democratic party. GET OUT THE VOTE GEORGIA FACEBOOK PHOTO TWO.jpgOn Dec. 17, Massachusetts Democrats sponsored a call-out to Georgia voters with Boston City Council President Kim Janey, Framingham Mayor Yvonne Spicer, Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins and U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. In a Zoom call, Pressley told a panel of Georgia residents that Democrats must regain control of the Senate this year. \u201cThe reason why the American people have only received 450 pennies a day for the last nine months is because of Mitch McConnell and this GOP-led Senate,\u201d Pressley said in reference to the various stimulus proposals swatted down by the Senate majority leader. Veronica Martinez, executive director of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, said it has made thousands of calls to Georgia from virtual phone banks in Massachusetts and has assigned staff to work on other initiatives as well. \u201cWe've also helped stand up an effort to make sure that every ballot is counted,\" she said. \"It's called curing the ballots. If there are any issues with signatures or anything like that, we're helping follow up and make sure that every vote that's cast is counted.\u201dMartinez added that some of the states\u2019 400 Democratic committee members were in Georgia \u201cknocking [on] doors as we speak.\u201d Massachusetts unions are also playing a major role in the get-out-the-vote effort in Georgia. Roxanna Rivera, vice-president of SEIU Local 32 BJ, which represents service workers, said the pandemic has made it even more critical for her union to help Democrats win the Senate. Among other issues, she said, \u201cThe Republican Party has been unwilling to act on legislation around COVID relief.\u201d Rivera said union members are making a special effort to contact Spanish-speaking voters. That relatively small but influential group in the Peach State is considered key to victory by both Democrats and Republicans. \u201cWe reached out to Latino voters, a demographic in Georgia that has become more active in voting just in this past general election. Many of our members are immigrants, and the issue of immigration reform \u2014 we know that we can't do that without a Democratic Senate,\u201d Rivera said. The Massachusetts GOP has raised tens of thousands of dollars for Loeffler and Purdue in Georgia for what it describes as \u201cthe last line of defense to block Democrats\u2019 socialist agenda.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line is that we need to help our conservative allies in the Peach State,\" Mass GOP chairman Jim Lyons wrote in one email appeal. \"Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are proven conservative leaders who will consistently vote to block the left\u2019s radical legislation.\u201dThe Massachusetts Republican Party did not respond to GBH News' request for comment by press time. Democrats in Massachusetts have raised millions for a race that already has driven more than 2.5 million people to cast ballots in Georgia in early voting. Between them, Ossoff and Warnock have raised more than $150 million from out-of-state donors.Neither side is completely confident they will come out on top. In a last-minute drive to get voters to the polls, Wilkerson said she recruited actors Rob Reiner, Alyssa Milano and Debra Messing to make calls to Georgia. She said the outcome will have a major impact way beyond the major Georgia cities of Atlanta, Savannah and Macon. \u201cWhat happens in Georgia is going to affect every single American, no question whatsoever,\" Wilkerson told GBH News. \"It is about the simple protection of this thing we call a democracy.\"Georgia officials believe Tuesday\u2019s balloting, combined with votes already cast, will be the biggest turnout for a run-off election in state history. And Massachusetts activists will have contributed to that history from a thousand miles away.",

      "body": "Just one week after Massachusetts closed schools and daycares in March, Boston Children's Hospital saw a drastic change in asthma-related visits to the emergency room: They were down 80% from the prior two months.For two more months, during the state's stay-at-home order, they stayed that way. When the order began lifting in late May, the ER was seeing 82% and 87% fewer asthma emergency visits compared to 2018 and 2019, according to a recent study published in the journal Annals of the American Thoracic Society.Dr. Tregony Simoneau, a pediatric pulmonologist and lead author of the study, says she expected a drop-off similar to those seen during summer breaks, but \"the sustained nature of it and the dramatic drop were surprising.\"The study's authors suggest emergency-room avoidance wasn't solely responsible for the decline, but that pandemic-driven changes in individual, community and environmental circumstances are likely at play.While the overall number of ER visits went down for patients between the ages of 2 and 22 after the shutdown, the decline was much steeper for the proportion of asthma-related visits in contrast to other types of pediatric emergencies. This held true when compared to the two months before the shutdown and the same time periods in 2018 and 2019, and across ethnicities.What about the children who did require care for asthma emergencies? There was no increase in the share who required hospitalization, suggesting most cases that made it to the ER weren't any worse than usual.Dr. Alan Schroeder, a pediatric critical care doctor at Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, says he's seen a similar trend with pediatric asthma during California's stay-at-home orders early in the pandemic, and in the months since.Like the Boston researchers, he believes the results likely reflect environmental and behavioral changes \u2014 ones that might be sustainable in a post-pandemic world.Here are some of the factors identified by the researchers:Better medication adherence The Centers for Disease Control estimates only 54% of children who take asthma medications use them as prescribed, which can lead to more frequent, and severe, asthma attacks. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, Simoneau says she's noticed patients and families refilling controller inhalers and rescue inhalers earlier and more often, and reporting better adherence to daily medications.Though it can't be determined if the change is due to fear of hospitals in the pandemic, health talk in the media or other factors (like spending more time at home), the study authors suggest medication adherence could be a big contributor to how long the ER visits were able to stay so low, as medications are able to maintain better control of symptoms over time.Schroeder, too, has witnessed \"a prevailing sense of trying to do everything you can at home to avoid being hospitalized,\" adding, \"If that meant more parents encouraging their kids to [use] their inhaler, it wouldn't be surprising as one of the mechanisms at play here.\"Access to telemedicineTelemedicine, also believed to help with medication adherence for adolescents, has had a much bigger role in the delivery of health care while people in the U.S. have sheltered in place.The convenience and availability of virtual visits means patients and parents can reach doctors earlier in the course of symptoms, and more often. By providing a platform for better at-home management of asthma symptoms, telemedicine could help fend off emergencies.Preventative hygienePublic health measures such as hand-washing, social distancing, disinfecting surfaces and staying home when sick are far more common in pandemic life, Schroeder points out. And doctors have seen fewer infections with common viruses in the past 10 months \u2014 infections that can be lethal for children who have asthma.\"These [measures] work. We've not seen the type of transmissible infections that we would normally be seeing \u2014 RSV, rhinovirus, influenza, metapneumovirus. In trying to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, we've also prevented the transmission of these other seasonal viruses that cause asthma exacerbations,\" Schroeder says.Simoneau credits these hygiene habits with keeping asthma emergency rates at Boston Children's lower going into winter in comparison to previous years, noting only a \"slight increase\" in the fall.Environmental and other factorsThe study authors also cited environmental reasons: improved air quality as more Americans worked from home, and had less contact with outdoor allergens such as pollen and dust on playgrounds, many of which have been off-limits during the COVID-19 crisis.The researchers additionally suspected the lack of participation in school sports, which are known to trigger exercise-induced asthma, both indoors and outdoors.Whether or not these factors are sustainable, pandemic-driven lifestyle changes have brought the pediatric community closer to solving a problem that has long plagued them: How to better protect children with asthma, and save lives.\"It's really an opportunity to do a deeper dive into understanding more about which element has had the greatest contribution to the drop in emergency room visits,\" Simoneau says. \"This is something we, as both clinicians and researchers, have been struggling with for quite some time, and yet this pandemic was quite effective in showing us what works. We just have to tease apart the things that could be really useful for the future.\"And while the value of mask-wearing in non-pandemic times is another question for the future, it's not stopping Simoneau's young patients from stepping up to do the right thing now \u2014 nevermind the contentious debate over mask-wearing among grown-ups\"Over time, and with some practice, they're able to wear them,\" she says of the kids she treats. \"Most of our patients are doing quite well with it.\"Kristen Kendrick is a board-certified family physician in Washington, D.C., and a health and media fellow at NPR and Georgetown University School of Medicine.

      "body": "Jake Harrison has always been a little skeptical about high school sports this year.The Boston Latin School senior, like any high school basketball player, had been looking forward to his senior season for years. But the coronavirus doesn\u2019t care about plans and dreams. So Harrison was prepared to finish his last year of high school without basketball.\u201cThroughout the summer as we started to get a bigger picture and actually know what was going on, I fully didn\u2019t expect us to have a season,\" he said.In the fall and early winter, even as COVID-19 numbers fluctuated, the BLS cross-country and golf teams continued to play. Both their seasons ended early. Athletes were hopeful, though, that winter sports would start on schedule in the district on Jan. 4. But then \u2014 the week before the season was scheduled to begin \u2014 BPS pushed the season back to an unspecified date. Before that postponement, Harrison had been running on a treadmill at home, trying to stay in shape for the truncated season. \u201cRunning every day or working out, that\u2019s something that our coaches won\u2019t be able to give us because we only have that hour, hour and a half to practice, memorize plays and stuff,\" he said. Mason Lawson, a point guard at Boston Latin Academy, had been playing outside in the cold before the snow came. Even with COVID cases higher than when school started in the fall, he was geared up and ready to go. \u201cHonestly, everyone I\u2019ve talked to about playing basketball, I haven\u2019t heard anything negative,\" he said. \"It\u2019s just been like, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to play, I can\u2019t wait to play. Like, when are we playing?\u2019\u201dBesides the significance and thrill of playing in his senior season, Lawson was looking forward to getting more film of him playing for college scouts to look at. \u201cThis year I was looking forward to getting offers and more looks and stuff,\" he said. \"But corona slowed all that down. So now I think I\u2019m going to do a post-grad year after BLA.\u201dAll of that came before the district\u2019s decision to put off the start of winter sports. While it still leaves some room for a start to the season, every delay at this point makes that prospect more complicated. Paige Lemieux, the athletic director at Charlestown High School, points out that part of what makes the situation difficult for students in Boston is seeing other communities getting a chance to play. \u201cSo when you have students calling you and saying, \u2018Hey, I just saw my friend doing tryouts in XYZ. Why can\u2019t we play in the city?\u2019\" she said, \"I think that\u2019s the delicate dance and the balance we\u2019re trying to find is being safe, but providing our students with equal opportunity that some of their suburban friends have.\u201dIt's been especially hard dealing with the ups and downs. And the waiting.  \u201cEverything\u2019s crazy. Two days ago, it was on the 4th. Yesterday, it\u2019s not on the 4th. Today, it\u2019s only Boston City League,'\" he said.  \"So I mean, every single day it\u2019s changing.\u201dIf there\u2019s a new start date, it will bring with it the challenge of fitting everything in before the winter season is scheduled to end in late February. Harrison said it\u2019s frustrating, but he had expected there would be a delay \u2014 or a cancellation. He\u2019s looking forward to playing in college, but If there\u2019s no season this year, he knows there\u2019s a bigger picture besides just basketball. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be sad,\" he said. \"But if you look at it in an overall view, we\u2019re keeping people safe.

      "body": "Updated at 1:52 p.m.Boston Mayor Marty Walsh signed an ordinance Monday creating a new Office of Police Accountability and Transparency, implementing a key recommendation of the police reform task force he convened last year after a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed George Floyd.\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing today is adding accountability,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in training, whether it\u2019s in hiring, whether it\u2019s in diversity, whether it\u2019s in police misconduct, we want to make sure we do everything we can [so] that people have the full faith and trust in the Boston Police Department.\u201dThe new office, which is frequently referred to as OPAT, includes a civilian review board that will investigate complaints from the public, an investigatory arm that will examine internal affairs cases and an administrative arm that will facilitate their efforts.While the new office has subpoena power \u2014 a longstanding goal of many advocates \u2014 it's not quite as powerful as some had hoped. In July, Boston City Councilors Ricardo Arroyo, Andrea Campbell and Julia Mejia filed a proposal that would have required Boston\u2019s police commissioner to comply with the civilian review board\u2019s findings.In December, the council backed a compromise between its proposal and the one made by the police reform task force in November. That compromise version, which Walsh signed Monday, requires that the police commissioner provide an explanation if he rejects the civilian review board\u2019s findings. Walsh, who has still not committed to seeking a third term this year, in 2020 repeatedly stressed his commitment to racial equity and invoked his efforts in that area Monday.\u201cHow do we deal with systemic racism, and change the systems that systemic racism [exacerbates]?\" Walsh said. \u201cWe declared racism a public-health crisis. \u2026 We also, prior to that, had put together a task force to look at health inequities due to COVID-19.\u201d In his remarks, which he made from a desk in his City Hall office, Walsh cast OPAT not as a way to address concerns about the behavior of some Boston police officers, but as a way to make an excellent police department better.\u201cWe have the best police department in the country, and there\u2019s no reason why anyone should be fearful of what we\u2019re doing today,\u201d Walsh said.In a statement, Campbell, who is running for mayor, called OPAT \"a win for our City and a major step towards eliminating racial disparities in our policing system,\" adding: \"Ultimately, credit goes to the advocates, including many on the Police Reform Task Force, who kept this conversation going for decades.\"Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu, who is also running for mayor, released a statement as well. In it, she called the signing of the ordinance \"an important step,\" and said she \"look[s] forward to continuing to push for urgent action to transform our systems of public safety and public health for racial justice and equity.\"",

It happened to coincide with a Boston Globe report on sexual assault claims made against Boston police Sgt. Clifton McHale in 2005. The Globe's report details a troubling allegation made against the officer, which led to a year-long suspension but didn\u2019t prevent him from later being promoted to sergeant. McHale is also the officer who was filmed joking about driving his squad car into Black Lives Matter protesters back in May. \"This is no progress, it\u2019s no justice, and, ironically, it\u2019s no peace,\u201d Price said of the reporting, while chiding the number of leaders who \"got on their milk crate,\" \"gave platitudes\" and \"pontificated about diversity statements\u201d in the aftermath of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd.\"The issue,\u201d Monroe added, is that \u201cwhite supremacy is so steeped in the culture,\u201d both in the commonwealth and across the country. \"I don\u2019t care if you live in a multicultural environment,\u201d she said, addressing Boston Public Radio listeners. \"You still see [people of color] as 'other.\u2019\"The Rev.

      "body": "Administrator Becky Annis hopes the 43 staff members at Pond Home elderly residential care facility, in Wrentham, will join its 38 residents in getting vaccinated for COVID-19 on Tuesday. But she's afraid that some may balk at the vaccine. \u201cWe've had a little bit of resistance from both residents and staff, and it\u2019s not unreasonable to have concerns, because initially it did all seem to be going so quickly,\u201d Annis told GBH News. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to strong-arm people into getting the vaccine, but we want it done.\u201d Tuesday will be the culmination of a long effort to reassure facility residents and staff about the vaccine. In addition to hosting the first \u201cVaccination Day\u201d for staff and patients Tuesday, Annis says she has been sending out emails, placing pamphlets and information packets around the facility and speaking to members of the community about the vaccine.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on getting people facts and helping them get information from places other than Facebook,\u201d Annis said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also emphasized that this is a way to be protected \u2014 not just for our residents and the community here, but for everyone they\u2019re involved with. This vaccine would allow us to get back to quasi-normal life again.\u201d Annis says she and her department heads have been working to emphasize a \u201cpositive outlook\u201d about the vaccine while actively fighting against the spread of rumors and unverified information. \u201cSomebody said they heard from a friend that Europe had stopped the vaccines, and we\u2019re like, what secret news source do you have? That\u2019s just not true,\u201d Annis said. \u201cI think so many people are getting misinformation.\u201d Pond Home is the first of eight properties operated by the nonprofit Rogerson Communities to host a vaccination event this month, working with Walgreens staff to provide federally-funded doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with follow-up events a few weeks later for the second dose. The 21 other properties owned by the group will host similar events throughout the following months, which Rogerson CEO Walter Ramos says will hopefully result in a fully-vaccinated community come spring. \u201cThere's apprehension, and some of the apprehension that people have is very legitimate,\" Ramos told GBH News. \"You know, there's a history here for some, and that history is not a pleasant one. I think, you know, we've got to get past that hurdle if we're to protect our community of elders, and that's what we're trying to do here. I know that for every person, this decision is personal. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m not mandating it, but I am encouraging it.\u201d Ramos operates a network of residential housing which includes nursing homes, long-term care facilities and independent living homes, with a population of residents ranging from 55 years old to 90 and older. \u201cI think the fact that the state is concentrating on [long-term care] facilities is important, I think it's the right priority,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cBut I do think that the next priority for seniors has got to be independent living.\u201d Annis says a vaccinated population, even if that just means residents, could dramatically impact day-to-day life at Pond Home. \u201cRight now, the residents have to eat six feet apart from each other and wear a mask if they leave their room,\u201d Annis said. \u201cThe rest of us can go home at night, and unless someone in our house is quarantined, we can take our mask off when we get home.\u201d Pond Home is providing additional paid time off for both full-time and part-time employees as both a way to ensure that nobody goes to work with COVID-19 symptoms and to encourage vaccinations, even if side effects could keep people out of work. \u201cIt's the right thing to do,\u201d Annis said. \u201cIt's a huge expense to a small organization, but it's important because we don't want people to come to work despite having symptoms just because they need to get paid.\u201d Though Pond Home hasn\u2019t had any serious illness due to COVID-19, Annis says this vaccination effort will play a huge role in keeping that record.\u201cWe are so very lucky in that respect,\u201d Annis said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had anyone pass away, and so many places have. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d",

      "body": "While President-elect Joe Biden is in the process of assembling his leadership team in Washington, there's a lot of chatter within the local legal community about who he will tap to serve as the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. One rumored candidate to replace Andrew Lelling is Suffolk County D.A. Rachael Rollins. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University law professor and GBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed to reflect on Lelling's legacy in the state and share his thoughts on what comes next. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: First of all, could Joe Biden simply decide to keep Lelling as our U.S. Attorney? I assume there's no requirement you have to fire everybody when a new president takes over. Daniel Medwed: Well, that's absolutely right. There's no law or regulation mandating turnover in these positions. It's more of a norm, or really a matter of pragmatism, that the new commander in chief wants his own people in these positions in order to execute his law enforcement priorities. For what it's worth, I think Lelling is particularly unlikely to stay in the job because he's quite conservative, especially for Massachusetts, and he's stirred up a lot of controversy in his three plus years in that position. Mathieu: Well, let's get into a little bit of that. There have been a bunch of high profile cases in Lelling's tenure. What's your overall assessment? Medwed: Well, it's very much a mixed bag. As you note, he seems very fond of high profile, somewhat splashy prosecutions. And on the one hand, he deserves a lot of credit for some of them. He's gone after the Massachusetts state police. It's one thing to investigate an agency like that \u2014 a very powerful agency \u2014 but it's something else to bring a few indictments and even secure some convictions, which he has done. He's gone a long way to rooting out corruption in the state police with its huge overtime billing scandal and other misdeeds. He also should be applauded for those Varsity Blues cases. That's when he prosecuted wealthy families for interfering with the admissions process at elite schools across the country, often by using a local intermediary named Rick Singer. Those cases were a shot across the bow to parents across the country that they should be on the up and up and not try to manipulate the process. But on the other hand, I think he's sometimes gone too far. The prime example of that is the case against Newton State Court Judge Shelley Joseph, who was charged with obstruction of justice for basically allowing an undocumented immigrant to evade apprehension by ICE in her Newton courtroom. I think it's a really bad signal for federal prosecutors to go after state court judges who don't directly violate federal criminal law, but simply don't actively assist in a very controversial federal policy. Mathieu: Rachael Rollins, as I mentioned, is a name that keeps coming up here, Daniel. I know you're a fan. What's your take on that? Medwed: I think it would be a great choice, and here's why. First, she has the experience. She's a former assistant U.S. attorney. She spent, I believe, four years in that office as a federal prosecutor. She also has a lot of administrative experience, not just in her current position, but in her previous stints in state agencies. Second, she's a brilliant, principled leader who is absolutely fearless, as we all know, when talking truth to power, [and] when going after powerful figures and saying things that need to be said. That's exactly what we need in a U.S. attorney \u2014 someone who is going to go after people like the Massachusetts State Police. The only downside, I think, is I'd hate to see her leave her current job because she's doing great work in Suffolk County, and in many respects, being the chief district attorney for a major county is a more important job, I think, than being the U.S. attorney. Mathieu: Really? So Suffolk is more important than the state? Medwed: The Boston-centric view of the world, right? Mathieu: Is that where you're going with this, though? Medwed: Well, here's what I'm trying to say, which is the bread and butter of law enforcement relates to state level crimes. Assault, rape, robbery [and] murder, those are prosecuted at the state level. The really attention-grabbing, headline-grabbing cases that involve interstate activity like sophisticated white collar criminal activity or things like official corruption or mass bombings, those are federal crimes. But they're few and far between. For the average citizen, if you really care about your community, the local district attorney has more clout [and] more influence than the U.S. attorney. ",

Charlie Baker plans a vaccination update at 10 a.m. and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh will hold a 1 p.m. COVID-19 update press conference at Faneuil Hall, but attention is also focused on the Legislature on the last day of its two-year session.House and Senate Democrats have had more than six months to reconcile transportation spending and economic development bills that cleared both branches by big margins but in differing forms, and now have only a few hours to reach agreements.Rep. William Straus and Sen. Joseph Boncore are the chief transportation bill (H 4547 and S 2836) negotiators. Rep. Aaron Michlewitz and Sen. Eric Lesser are the lead conferees on the economic development bills (S 2874 and H 4887).The economic development bills include small business aid, sports betting and housing production initiatives. and Baker said this week that the transportation bill includes outlays the state needs in order to attract federal reimbursements.Conferences on policing reform, climate change, health care and the overdue fiscal 2021 budget led to agreements this month. The climate bill was sent to Baker on Monday and with the session ending today, his options for dealing with bills that reach his desk this late in the session are limited to two: sign it or veto it.Any agreement on either bill by six-member conference committees would require the House and Senate to suspend their rules designed to give members time to review bills prior to voting on them, a vote that lawmakers have bee willing to take in the past to ensure that proposals reach the governor's desk and do not die with the ending of the session.The branches gavel back into session at noon and the Legislature must end its session by midnight and when it does so it is referred to as adjourning sine die. The new two-year session begins on Wednesday.Baker holds his 10 a.m. vaccination update from Baystate Medical Center in Springfield and plans an 11:30 a.m. event at the Springfield Innovation Center where he plans to discuss internet connectivity and make an economic recovery announcement.

      "body": "Today is the last day of the legislature's 191st session, and there are a few last-minute agenda items coming down to the wire, including bills on economic development and the environment. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with GBH News State House reporter Mike Deehan about what lawmakers need to finish before the end of the day. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: We've been talking about the clock ticking here for months, Mike. It's about to finally stop. With less than 24 hours to go, what do lawmakers need to finish work on? Mike Deehan: Well, there's an awful lot. Beacon Hill loves a deadline, and this is kind of the system they've set up. They push everything until the last minute, there's a big rush to get everything done and then excuses are made about the things that didn't get done because they \"ran out of time.\" Things get caught up in horse trading, issues bleed into one another [and] lawmakers get a lot on their plate. So the biggest outstanding issue that lawmakers really have to do right now, or should by what they're telling us, is this economic development bill. They've been negotiating this between the House and Senate since July 30th when they extended their deadline until today. It was going to end at the end of July. So unless they get it done today, it's going to be another victim of that Democratic Party infighting where the majority party can't settle on things between those two chambers. Watch: What do we mean by economic development?Raw HtmlMathieu: Could portions pass then? Could this pass in some unrecognizable form? Deehan: Not at this point. No. It's all or nothing because of this big, omnibus bill. It's such a chunker right now that you can't really separate things. If it dies and it goes into next session, then yeah, they might have new life as separate vehicles that could be easier to agree with, but it's not really Beacon Hill's style. They want to cram everything into one big vote and let it fly or die, as it might be in this case. Mathieu: They're close to finishing up a climate change bill as well today, Mike. What's inside that? Deehan: Yeah, that actually got to Governor Baker's desk late yesterday. They reached an agreement on Sunday and actually passed it through the chambers, like they're supposed to. The big headline here is that it would call for [net-zero] carbon emissions by 2050. That's only 29 years away, Joe. So it's a big deal. It has a lot to do with getting electric vehicles on the road, decreasing the reliance on combustion vehicles. So by 2050, essentially, gas guzzlers out, electric vehicles will be the mainstream. That's probably going to happen faster than that. But there's also an awful lot of smaller what they're calling \"roadmaps\" for specific sectors \u2014 like the transportation sector, the housing sector, medical sector, things like that \u2014 to get away from fossil fuels [and] on to clean energy and those no emissions. It does greatly increase the amount of wind energy that utilities are required to buy, which might increase some electricity costs in the short run, but it'll spur growth in that industry and create jobs in this big wind sector that we've been trying to to build here. It also has stuff about natural gas safety [and] pipelines, if you remember what happened in the Merrimack Valley not too long ago. And there's lots of new standards for municipalities on appliances [and] things like that. It's really a grab bag of climate change legislation. Mathieu: We've got a couple of other things here that I could touch on, including telehealth, but in our remaining seconds here, Mike, with this being the final day, what happens if they don't get some of these bills to the governor on time? Deehan: Well, the governor can kill them now because it's within the 10-day window. They should have gotten the stuff done 10 days ago, essentially, if they didn't want Baker to kill them. So he has all the power and he has for over a week. But the new session starts tomorrow. Bills will have to be refiled, they'll have to do all the work again and start over. Probably nothing major then would pass until the late spring, early summer. ",

      "body": "Boston will keep its hightened COVID-19 precautions in place for three more weeks of the new year, Mayor Marty Walsh announced Tuesday.Last month, Walsh reverted back to phase II of the state\u2019s four-phased reopening plan in an effort to curb the rising COVID-19 caseload \u2014 fueled in large part by people disregarding the pleas of public health officials in order to celebrate the holidays with loved ones and extended family. Many other parts of the commonwealth are in Phase III.The continued restrictions in Boston mean that many cultural and entertainment spaces like gyms, health clubs, movie theaters, museums and bowling alleys will remain closed. Office space, indoor dining, churches, retail businesses, outdoor theaters and performance spaces and hair and other personal service venues can operate at 25% capacity.Speaking from Faneuil Hall, Walsh cast the step as unfortunate but necessary.\u201cGiven the high numbers that we\u2019re seeing today and in the last several weeks, we\u2019re extending this pause for at least another three weeks until Jan. 27,\u201d he said, pointing to the city\u2019s 431 new cases and its 1,020 death toll as of Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be standing here as mayor at the beginning of the new year talking about shutting businesses down,\u201d he said, expressing a desire to instead open the city back to its bustling normalcy. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t take the precautions now, that will not happen.\u201dWalsh also warned, again, that if key numbers \u2014 positive cases, deaths and hospital capacity among them \u2014 continue to trend dangerously upward, more safety measures will be necessary.\u201cNinety-three percent of adult, non-surgical [intensive care unit] beds are occupied,\" Walsh explained. \"This is the highest that we\u2019ve seen in quite some time here in the city. We just need to continue to remind people to do their part.\u201d Asked about the restrictions\u2019 effectiveness, Walsh responded that he believes the rollback is working to lessen residents\u2019 opportunities to spread the virus further. He attributed the current upward trend to people \u201cunintentionally letting their guard down\u201d and socializing with others they don\u2019t live with.Walsh said the city will reassess its key COVID-19 metrics in another three weeks. If the numbers show a sustained decline, the city could move forward with lifting restrictions. The mayor also declined to address the rumors that President-elect Joe Biden is considering him for a cabinet post. Asked, again, whether he\u2019d been contacted by Biden\u2019s vetting team, Walsh replied that he\u2019s been focused on COVID-19.\u201cI\u2019m going to stay focused on that,\" he said. \"I\u2019m going to stay focused on my State Of The City [Address], which is coming up next Tuesday. Whatever the speculation is, or whatever the talk is, I\u2019m going to let that go.\"",

      "body": "With Mayor Pete Buttigieg poised to become the next US Secretary of Transportation, GBH news reached out to four well-known local transit advocates to get their take on what to expect. Former Massachusetts Secretary of Transportation Jim Aloisi supported Buttigieg during his presidential run and says Mayor Pete is a good choice to be the Transportation secretary. Aloisi says although Buttigieg may not have the broad experience that some think is required for the cabinet position, that could actually be a positive.\u201cSomeone who actually doesn't have a lifetime of deep roots in transportation policy is likely to be more open to learning and into thinking about new ways of doing business,\" he said. \"I think it's an exciting choice and a really good opportunity for advocates like me to have a Transportation secretary who will be open to new ideas and not come with preconceptions and not come freighted with the old status quo, which has not been serving us well.\u201d Aloisi is looking forward to Buttigieg spending less on highway expansion and more on mass transit, especially rail, and reducing the use of diesel powered buses and trains to make all transportation less polluting. Chris Dempsey, director of Transportation 4 Massachusetts, is also optimistic about the new Transportation secretary, though he said that Buttigieg's experience to date does not match the role in terms of its breadth, focus on transportation, and size.\"But he's picked up some lessons from his time as mayor of South Bend that are instructive for communities across the entire country,\" Dempsey said. \"He's done things like change the way streets in South Bend are allocated between pedestrians, cyclists and drivers. We know we need to do more of that in communities across Massachusetts and again across the country.\" Stacy Thompson, executive director of Livable Streets, said although she is optimistic, some of Buttigieg\u2019s policies while Mayor of South Bend were controversial.\u201cHe does not have credibility with the Black and Brown community,\" Thompson said. \"We think about housing and transportation together. And he had a beautification policy that ended up tearing down homes in Black and Brown communities. You can't build bike lanes and tear down homes at the same time.\u201d Jarred Johnson, executive director of Transit Matters, credits Buttigieg with improving South Bend\u2019s streets by limiting car use and providing more access for cyclists and pedestrians but acknowledges there were civil rights concerns regarding some of his policies. \u201cI think those concerns are valid,\" Johnson said. \"And even though I'm cautiously optimistic, I think myself and other transit advocates are going to be watching closely and making sure that he tries to remedy those concerns.\u201d All agree that there is hope that the new Biden administration with Buttigieg at the helm of the Transportation Department will provide the federal funding needed for big projects in Massachusetts, like rebuilding the MBTA, redesigning the Mass Pike in Allston, expanding passenger rail and lessening the air pollution and greenhouse gases produced by the transportation sector.",

      "body": "Amid mounting cases of COVID-19 in the state\u2019s prisons and jails, a group of community organizations are calling on Gov. Charlie Baker and top lawmakers to push the Parole Board to expedite releases of eligible parolees.More than 70 organizations on Tuesday sent a 10-page letter alerting state officials to what they call \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the parole system, including what they allege are low release rates, long delays for decisions and unnecessary re-incarceration of parolees who haven\u2019t committed new crimes.Elizabeth Matos, executive director of the Boston-based Prisoners\u2019 Legal Services, says organizations have long been concerned about the efficacy of the seven-member Parole Board \u2014 but continued health risks related to the pandemic make reform more urgent.At least 17 people incarcerated in the state\u2019s prisons and jails have died of COVID-19 since the pandemic began, four since late December, data shows. More than 3,000 prisoners have tested positive for the disease in a prison population now hovering just under 13,000, according to data provided by officials to the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.\u201cThere's no evidence that they are making a concerted effort to use parole to mitigate the impact of COVID,\u201d Matos said. \u201cPeople are literally dying on a weekly basis at this point.\u201dJake Wark, a spokesman for the Parole Board, released a written statement on Tuesday saying the state agency is working to reduce the prison and jail population in accordance with the law. \u201cBy adopting new tools, strategies and partnerships, the Board remains committed to its mission to promote successful re-entry, benefiting both parolees and the communities in which they live,\u201d he said. The Massachusetts parole system is the oldest in the country and has been the focus of calls for reform for years \u2014 but it was largely left out of the state\u2019s criminal justice overhaul in 2018. The length of time between hearings and decisions for inmates with life sentences rose from an average of three months in 2015 to more than nine months in 2018, according to an investigation published last year by the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting and The Boston Globe. Parolees had been returned to prison for violating conditions of their parole like drinking a glass of wine and talking to a former prisoner, the investigation showed. The parole board has also faced criticism for its treatment of mentally ill patients. This week\u2019s letter listed a series of community groups, including the Justice Resource Institute in Needham, the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute of Race & Justice at Harvard Law School and the Prisoners\u2019 Assistance Project at Northeastern University.Attorney Patricia Garin, who co-runs the Northeastern law clinic, said the Parole Board has long been behind in its work but that now the delays are more dangerous. State data shows the population of incarcerated people has dropped from about 15,000 in April to less than 13,000, but advocates say that is not enough. \u201cWith the advent of the COVID crisis, it makes all of these delays so much more critical and so much more problematic and so much more deadly,\u2019\u2019 she said. In the letter, advocates listed a series of issues and recommendations, and they ask state officials to meet to find ways to move forward. Garin said she has hope but is also skeptical. \u201cWe have not seen any progress in a long time,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cWe're hoping to get some support from the executive branch and the Legislature to get the parole board to do its work more effectively and expeditiously.\u201d",

But we can still turn that around, according to Dr. Nicholas Reich,  a professor of biostatistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.Reich, who has been modeling the pandemic in collaboration with the CDC since the spring, said the United State could log as many as 25,000 deaths a week this month.But in the midst of these bleak numbers, Reich sees a silver lining.\"We know the cases that have occurred in the last few weeks, we know how many people are hospitalized, and that really does a lot to inform us about what the next four weeks will look like in terms of mortality,\" he said. \"But what we've seen is that predicting the next four weeks of numbers of incident cases is quite a bit harder. And I think that is due to the fact that the die is not cast. You know, the sudden changes that we make on an individual level or a societal level can really have a dramatic impact on the trajectory.\"Action is exactly what Dr. Michael Collins, chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, is calling for.

      "body": "Updated Jan. 7, 2020, at 8:21 p.m.Immigrants across Massachusetts have resisted getting the COVID-19 vaccine out of fear of deportation or others legal consequences, according to lawyers, activists and community leaders.\u201cWe have been fielding phone calls from individuals who are concerned that they will be deported if they get a vaccine,\u201d Iv\u00e1n Espinoza-Madrigal, of Lawyers for Civil Rights, told GBH News. \u201cWe have been advising individuals and families that they absolutely must make themselves available for testing and vaccination and that these activities will not trigger immigration consequences, but the harm has already been done. The misconceptions exist.\u201d It would be illegal for medical officials to share information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But such concerns are still likely to hurt a public vaccination campaign, Espinoza-Madrigal says, which could compromise the wider population\u2019s ability to reach herd immunity.\u201c(It's) not because immigrants are trying to be difficult but because the Trump administration has created such tremendous fear and insecurity in immigrant communities that the trust has been broken,\u201d Espinoza-Madrigal said. \u201cIt's going to take a significant effort from public health officials and local governments to fill that trust gap so that immigrants can come forth for vaccination.\u201d In January of last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could enact a \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule against documented immigrants who use federal resources, allowing the government to block their applications for permanent residency, also known as a green card. That's caused many immigrants to resist accepting CARES Act benefits or signing up for federally-funded COVID-19 tests or vaccines, according to Amy Grunder, director of legislative affairs at the MIRA Coalition. \u201cPeople are afraid,\u201d Grunder told GBH News. \u201cThey think that if there's some possibility of securing a path to citizenship, they don't want this to get in the way.\u201dLast February, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services excluded COVID-19 testing and treatment from the public charge rule, encouraging \"all those, including aliens, with symptoms that resemble coronavirus ... to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services.\"\"Such treatment or preventive services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future public charge analysis,\" the update reads.Immigrants served by the MIRA coalition have also expressed fears that information shared at a vaccination site may be leaked to ICE and may lead to a deportation, even though medical privacy laws would prevent such information sharing, Grunder said. \u201cOver the last four years, immigrants have had a justifiable fear that any interaction with federal officials, particularly ICE, could be a disaster for themselves and their families,\u201d Grunder said. \u201cBecause of that, because of fears of family separation, they become unwilling to seek access to other kinds of institutions as well as well; people are afraid to contact law enforcement, people are afraid to go to court for a restraining order, people are afraid to get care in hospitals and people are afraid to get other kinds of of medical assistance as well.\u201d Ensuring that undocumented immigrants feel safe in getting vaccinated will significantly slow the spread of the virus, according to Helena DaSilva Hughes, the executive director at the Immigrants Assistance Center, which serves a population of roughly 12,000 immigrants per year in New Bedford. \u201cIt has to be free, simple and no questions asked,\u201d DaSilva Hughes told GBH News. \u201cIt also has to be members of their community who they trust. They have to take the vaccine and show that it\u2019s safe.\u201d Dasilva Hughes says many immigrants, particularly those who work in the city\u2019s more than 45 fish \u201chouses,\u201d factories and processing centers, were reluctant to get tested for COVID-19 until Gov. Charlie Baker implemented the Stop the Spread testing sites. \u201cStop the Spread worked quite beautifully in New England because it was free and no questions asked,\u201d DaSilva Hughes said. \u201cWe saw a lot of testing being done, and what I am hoping is that the same system used for Stop the Spread will be utilized when the vaccine gets here for the general population.\u201d Since the beginning of the pandemic, DaSilva Hughes has been on an information-sharing campaign \u2014 hosting a local community-access television show in Portuguese, working with local religious and community leaders to quell misinformation regarding testing and the vaccine and communicating with her own clients the importance of utilizing federal resources. \u201cWe know that there's a lack of trust within the immigrant population. They don't trust too many people,\u201d DaSilva Hughes said. \u201cWe know that they trust the churches and they trust us, because we've been around for 50 years and we provide services to them. We represent them, we look like them and they trust us, which is very important.\u201d DaSilva Hughes said she was skeptical about the vaccine at one point herself \u2014 until she heard a doctor from the community explain what the vaccine was and how it worked.\u201cBy the time he finished explaining in the program about the vaccine, I was ready to take it,\" she said. \"It depends who's giving the message. We, as the leaders of the community, need to show that we trust it and so it\u2019s okay for them to trust it, too.\u201dCorrection: An earlier version of this article stated that the public rule charge could determine that undocumented immigrants are ineligible for citizenship. The public rule charge only affects permanent residency, also known as a green card. The article also stated that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services suspended the public charge rule last February. The federal government did not suspend the entire public charge rule but excluded COVID-19 testing and treatment it. GBH News regrets these errors.",

      "body": "There\u2019s a movement afoot on Beacon Hill that's been more than 200 million years in the making: Massachusetts will soon have an official state dinosaur. Representative Jack Lewis, a Democrat from Framingham, plans to introduce legislation in the state house next week to make it official. He joined Joe Mathieu on GBH's Morning Edition today to discuss the educational effort.Lewis, a Cub Scout den leader, hatched the idea early in the pandemic, when he was trying to think of creative ways to engage with his Cub Scouts as they learned about dinosaurs and fossils. Lewis created an online survey and invited residents of the Commonwealth to choose between two options for the state dinosaur: Holyoke\u2019s Podokesaurus or Springfield\u2019s Anchisaurus. Lewis said that, as of last night, more than 10,000 votes have been cast.TweetThe two candidates \u2014 one a carnivore and one an herbivore \u2014 are the only two dinosaur species that have been discovered in Massachusetts. The Podokesaurus was discovered in Holyoke in 1910 by Mignon Talbot, the first woman to identify a dinosaur by name. Lewis revealed that the \"Swift-footed lizard of Holyoke\" has taken the lead in the online survey.PodokesaurusThe Anchisaurus, discovered in 1855 in Springfield, is believed to be the first dinosaur discovered and documented in North America. It has a long neck like its more famous cousin, the Brachiosaurus, but a more diminutive size: it was only around 6-feet in length. \u201cWhile these aren\u2019t the huge creatures we all know from our childhood or movies, they have historic significance in paleontology,\u201d Lewis said.Dr. Susan Heilman, program manager of community initiatives at the Museum of Science, Boston and longtime fan of dinosaurs, is thrilled about the upcoming legislation and the recognition for New England\u2019s hometown dinosaurs.\u201cThey're both little guys, they're both very cute. They both probably only stood maybe a foot or so off the ground,\u201d Heilman said. \u201cSo Anchisaurus gets a little bit of my vote because it's probably an early version of the more famous, huge longneck dinosaurs that you see later on.\" ModuleHeilman, who has worked on several dinosaur excavations out West, noted that because of Massachusetts\u2019 geography and that it\u2019s covered in forests, roads and cities, we aren\u2019t likely to find many dinosaurs \u2014 but we have something else. \u201cWe have no dinosaurs, but we are one of the world class places to find dinosaur footprints,\u201d she said. In fact, the Massachusetts state fossil is the Eubrontes, a large three-toed dinosaur footprint discovered in the Connecticut River Valley.Once voting concludes, Lewis plans to introduce the bill next week, where it will go through the standard legislative process of committees and voting. Lewis is heartened by the overwhelming public response to the campaign. \u201cIf they [the dinosaurs] can help young folks better understand the democratic process, if they can help young folks connect interests to possible future careers, then I\u2019m happy to engage the thousands and thousands of people across the commonwealth who are interested in this pursuit,\u201d he said.The state already has a state bird, the black-capped chickadee, and a state flower, which is, of course, the mayflower.

On Wendesday\u2019s Boston Public Radio, Dr. Virginia Sinnott-Stutzman, a senior staff veterinarian at Angell Animal Medical Center, joined the show for an inaugural edition of \u201cAsk the Vet.\u201d For 40 minutes, she talked training and care and responded to questions from listeners on issues like separation anxiety, pandemic-era weigh gain, deciphering your cat\u2019s meows and much more. \"I think we\u2019ve all learned the value \u2026 of that companionship of a pet,\u201d she said, reflecting on the takeaways of animal ownership during COVID-19. \"They\u2019re so non-judgmental, and never [at] anytime in my life have I ever wanted to be around a non-judgmental being [more].\u201d",

But the 85-year-old resident of Goddard House in Brookline sat smiling on a recent day, snuggling with a brown and white puppy \u2014 not the live kind, but a cuddly toy.\u201cSometimes, you know, you just feel a little lonely, or just out of place. And that's when it really, really matters,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThere's something soft and fuzzy, and \u2026 a thing we miss most of all is human contact. And animal contact as well.\u201d  PetPals, a program of FriendshipWorks, usually sends volunteers and their dogs to visit seniors in assisted living and nursing homes. During the pandemic, the program is instead sending stuffed animals. It\u2019s part of a growing trend across the country to help fill the void in seniors\u2019 lives. There\u2019s little research on the effect of stuffed animals, but there is plenty of anecdotal evidence they offer comfort.\u201cHuman beings have a strange built-in psychology of what we feel, fall in love with, and what we would defend and what we've become attached to. It's not always things that give us back human emotion in return,\u201d said William Banks, a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Washington and associate chief of research and development at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Seattle. FriendshipWorks Executive Director Janet Seckel-Cerotti said while the stuffed animal gifts can\u2019t replace human \u2014 or even animal \u2014 interaction, the goal is to find anything that helps with socialization in the pandemic. \u201cWe're finding that the reaction is lovely and people are delighted,\u201d she said, \u201cand you just can't argue with that.\u201d For the full story, click the audio or video players above.

      "body": "As thousands of people stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling for the re-election of President Donald Trump and violently clashing with police, Scott Gilbert and Stan Lawrence began to gather up their signs, their megaphones and put out a call to Massachusetts-based activists: Fight back. \u201cWe need millions of people to be in the street to stop this fascist movement,\u201d Gilbert told GBH News, marching from Nubian Square to the Massachusetts State House with a crowd of around 50 protesters Wednesday night. \u201cThe hardened fascists are taking over the capital. Where are the millions of people who hate this sh*t right now? They need to be in the streets.\u201d Gilbert, a 67-year-old Somerville resident, and Lawrence, a 72-year-old from Arlington, are both regional organizers for the Refuse Facism movement, which was created shortly after the election of Trump. ModuleWearing an orange shirt that read, \u201cTRUMP PENCE OUT NOW\u201d Lawrence led the crowd in a chant, \u201cTrump lost! Facists go home!\u201d while marching down Tremont street. \u201cThis has to be the beginning of a movement that brings people into the streets,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIt was wonderful that millions of people voted to remove Trump from power. But people have to realize that you can't put back a fascist movement by voting and then going home. You have to come out in the streets and the numbers have to grow.\u201d The Refuse Facism organizers are planning protests every day in Boston and in cities around the country until President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated and the transition of power is complete, Lawrence said. Congress was set to confirm that Biden had won the 2020 presidential election Wednesday, an outcome that Trump \u2014 who lost both the electoral college and the popular vote \u2014 continues to dispute. \u201cWe will never give up, we will never concede,\u201d Trump told a crowd of his supporters outside the White House, just one hour before the process to count the electoral votes was set to begin. That\u2019s when the demonstration turned violent, with a mob of armed Trump supporters pushing their way into the U.S. Capitol, firing weapons and pushing past police and security. A woman was shot inside the building and later died. At the protest in Boston, activist Antuan Castro Del Rio expressed disbelief that the police \u2014 who tear-gassed protesters outside a church in D.C. so that the president could pose with a bible \u2014 could not stop Wednesday\u2019s mob. \u201cAre you going to tell me that in the most militarized country on the planet, with the most militarized police in the world, they couldn't stop a small group of white men who are armed?\u201d Castro Del Rio, a 32-year-old Watertown resident, told GBH News. \u201cWe have a country that has different judicial systems, one for Black and Brown people, one for police and armed forces and one for the rest of the people. We police Black and Brown people one way, and we police white people another way.\u201d The response from law enforcement to the pro-Trump extremists who breached the Capitol building was symbolic of a larger policing issue, Lawrence said, where those who support and uphold a \u201cfascist regime\u201d of white supremacy are supported by police departments. \u201cIf there had been a demonstration of Black Lives Matter that had come anywhere near that level of intensity, they would have been forcefully, powerfully put down,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that these thugs were able to run rampant in the halls of Congress demonstrates to me that it wasn't being taken seriously.\u201d Ernst Jean-Jacques, a Roxbury-based activist who was recently arrested during a protest in Swampscott, said Wednesday\u2019s events demonstrated a disparity in policing that Black Lives Matter activists like him have been fighting against all summer. \u201cLaw enforcement protects one side and assassinates and harasses the other side,\" Jean-Jacques said. \"Something has got to give.\u201d ",

(AP) \u2014 Authorities in Massachusetts have identified a man fatally shot by police above a local candy store this week.Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said Tuesday that Michael Conlon, 28, of Newton, was killed after refusing to comply with orders to drop his knife Monday afternoon.State and local police had been responding to a 911 call from the owner of \u201cIndulge!\u201d in Newton. Ryan said officers located Conlon, who lived above the shop, in a second floor hallway.The officers followed him to the third floor and called for backup, including a mental health clinician, she said.Newton police discharged a beanbag gun at Conlon at about 2 p.m., which was followed by a state trooper\u2019s attempt to subdue him with a stun gun, Ryan said.Conlon, however, continued to advance on the officers while still holding the knife, prompting two Newton officers to fire at him, Ryan said. He was transported to Newton Wellesley Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.Ryan said the Newton officers, who have not been named, were placed on temporary paid administrative leave, as is standard during police-involved shooting investigations.The state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is determining the cause and manner of death, she said.",

      "body": "The secret is in the details with this hummus recipe from Milk Street.\u00a0For starters, processing the chickpeas while warm ensures the smoothest, lightest product. You'll want to process it for a full three minutes, and then top it off with paprika, cumin, chopped fresh parsley, and extra-virgin olive oil drizzle. Perfection!Ingredients:Cold water 8 ounces (227 grams) dried chickpeas 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 cup-toasted sesame tahini, room temperature 3 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 to 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon paprikaDirections:In a large bowl, combine 8 cups of cold water, the chickpeas and 2 tablespoons of the salt. Let soak at least 12 hours, or overnight. In a large saucepan or stockpot over high heat, bring another 10 cups of water and the baking soda to a boil. Drain the soaked chickpeas, discarding soaking water, and add to the pot. Return to a simmer, then reduce to medium and cook until the skins are falling off and the chickpeas are very tender, 45 to 50 minutes. Set a mesh strainer over a large bowl and drain the chickpeas into it; reserve 3/4 cup of the chickpea cooking water. Let sit for 1 minute to let all liquid drain. Set aside about 2 tablespoons of chickpeas, then transfer the rest to the food processor. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt, then process for 3 minutes. Stop the processor and add the tahini. Continue to process until the mixture has lightened and is very smooth, about 1 minute. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the processor bow. With the machine running, add the 3/4 cup of cooking liquid and the lemon juice. Process until combined. Taste and season with salt. Transfer the hummus to a shallow serving bowl and use a large spoon to make a swirled well in the center. Drizzle with olive oil, then top with the reserved 2 tablespoons chickpeas, parsley, cumin and paprika. Don\u2019t forget stir the tahini very well. Some brands separate and can become quite thick at the bottom of the container. If your tahini is particularly thick, you may need to add a tablespoon or two of tap water for the hummus to reach the right consistency. If you reserve some of the hummus to serve later, you won\u2019t need the full amounts of olive oil, cumin and paprika to garnish.",

      "body": "This one-pot recipe from Milk Street is quick, healthy, and a great alternative to traditional pasta dinners. Assembling and preparing all of the ingredients before cooking is the trick to the timing - take a few minutes and get your mise en place in order before you start.Ingredients:1 pound medium asparagus, tough ends trimmed 5 tablespoons white miso 4 tablespoons salted butter, softened 1 1/2 tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger 12 ounces soba noodles 3 scallions, minced, plus thinly sliced scallions to garnish 4 fried eggs Shichimi to garnish rice seasoning, to serve (optional) Lemon wedges, to serveDirections:Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, snap or cut off the tender tips of the asparagus. Set aside. Slice the stalks on the bias into 1/2-inch pieces. Set aside separately. In a large bowl, combine the miso, butter and ginger, stirring and mashing. Add the noodles to the boiling water. Cook for about 1 minute. Add the asparagus stalks and cook for another minute. Add the tips, then cook for 2 minutes. Drain the noodles and asparagus, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water. The noodles should be just tender. Add the noodles, asparagus and minced scallions to the miso butter. Add enough reserved cooking water to reach a creamy consistency, using tongs to toss until the butter melts and coats the noodles. Divide the noodles between 4 serving bowls and top each with a fried egg. Sprinkle with sliced scallions and shichimi to garnish, if using. Serve with lemon wedges. Don't add salt to the soba cooking water. While we usually salt our pasta water, miso can be quite salty and sodium levels vary widely by brand. Skipping the salt gave us better control over seasoning.",

      "body": "Updated 5:43 p.m.President-elect Joe Biden will tap Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to lead the U.S. Department of Labor, according to published reports.The news, first reported by Politico, triggered a flurry of congratulatory statements, though the Walsh\u2019s press office declined comment.As recently as Wednesday, several people close to Walsh insisted that there was no way the mayor was leaving Boston.Walsh's first declared challenger, City Councilor Michelle Wu, however, is bidding him a fond farewell.\u201cHe will be the first union member to serve in this role in nearly 50 years, and his leadership will come at a critical time for the labor movement,\u201d Wu's statement said. \u201cThere is much work to do to clean up the backwards, anti-worker policies of the Trump administration that have hurt so many here in our city, and Boston needs a partner to fight for working families at the federal level.\u201dCity Councilor Andrea Campbell, who is thus far the only other candidate running for mayor, expressed similar sentiments, calling the position a \u201cfitting role\u201d for Walsh.\u201cThe realities of division in our country and city have never been more clear than they have this year - amidst a pandemic and yesterday\u2019s domestic attack on our democracy. For Boston, there\u2019s so much at stake in 2021 as we look to recover from this pandemic and reimagine what our city can be without persistent inequities. I know Mayor Walsh will be a partner in that work in this new role.\u201dMassachusetts Democrat Rep. Richard Neal of Springfield, who chairs the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement that he was \"thrilled to hear that Mayor Marty Walsh has been chosen for our new Labor Secretary.\"\"Throughout his career he has been a champion for worker\u2019s rights and I am confident that he will succeed in this new position in the Biden Administration,\" Neal said.\u201cMarty is a strong champion of American workers,\u201d tweeted former Clinton-era Labor Secretary Robert Reich.The news came just hours after Walsh called for President Donald Trump\u2019s removal from office and condemned the violent siege of the U.S. Capitol the day before.Prior to becoming mayor, Walsh helmed the Building and Construction Trades Council of Massachusetts and simultaneously served as a state representative.Walsh personifies Biden's close ties to organized labor. The president-elect has reportedly told business leaders that unions will enjoy more power in his administration.If Biden does appoint Walsh, Boston City Council President Kim Janey will become acting mayor until a new municipal chief is elected in November.It's not unusual for creditable reports of a Biden cabinet appointment to surface about 24 hours before the official announcement.",

      "body": "More than 100 protesters gathered outside the Massachusetts State House on Thursday to oppose Wednesday's violence in Washington, D.C., and call for community action against what many described as a rising tide of \"fascism\" in the United States.\u201cIf they want a civil war, we are the party for socialism and liberation \u2014 and we say we don't need a civil war, we need a class war,\u201d Dorchester-based activist Nino Brown told the crowd. \u201cWe need to get rid of not just Trump but the followers of fascism, because America was always a far right country.\u201dMassachusetts activists from local organizations including Refuse Fascism and Boston Socialist Alternative have vowed to continue protesting every day until President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated. Toya Chester, an organizer with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103, a labor union, urged the crowd to continue organizing long after Biden is in office. \u201cTrump is just a symptom and a symbol of what goes on in your society every day,\u201d Chester told the crowd. \u201cIt's clear that these far-right-wing forces are more organized than ever, and that's why they need to be stopped.\u201d Following remarks from Trump that the 2020 presidential election was \u201cstolen from us\u201d on Wednesday, thousands of pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol as part of a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d demonstration, falsely claiming that Trump, who lost both the Electoral College and the popular vote, was the true winner. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody in the crowd has illusions in Biden, but I sure don\u2019t like that the Democrats aren\u2019t equipped to handle Trump or the far right,\u201d Chester said, \u201cThey've had plenty of opportunities, and they have completely failed. We cannot wait and see if they're going to stand up for us. We have to do it ourselves.\u201dDSC_2881.jpgBefore meeting at the state house, a separate protest led by local organizers from Refuse Fascism, a movement formed in response to Trump\u2019s election, held a moment of silence at the Holocaust memorial in the North End. \u201cPeople have to understand there's a certain development of history, and people need to understand that history,\u201d Stan Lawrence, an organizer for Refuse Fascism, told GBH News. \u201cThey need to look at things like the Holocaust \u2014 which was, for younger people, a while back \u2014 and realize that it was real. Millions and millions of people died because the German people did not act in a way that could have prevented that from happening. We have those lessons to learn from, and we need to act on them.\u201d For activist Scott Gilbert, those lessons are personal. Gilbert carries a photo in his wallet of a young Anne Frank sitting beside Gabrielle Dorothy Kahn \u2014 Gilbert's mother. \u201cI carry it with me because it kind of brings it home and makes it real,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cThat's what happened in the Capitol, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now, if we don\u2019t stop it.\u201d Gilbert, a 67-year-old Somerville resident, wants to see a national movement to \u201cmove the goalposts\u201d of the political spectrum left after four years of a Trump presidency. \u201cIt's going to take a lot of work, and people have to sacrifice. But part of that is taking responsibility and acting,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cAnd as people act, we can change this. It's not a foregone conclusion. I remember living in 1965, during the war in Vietnam, and I grew up with that. I have the advantage of seeing that kind of change can actually happen. Change is very real and very possible. But people have to act to make it happen.\u201d The crowd marched from the State House to the steps of Boston City Hall, ending with speakers like Blythe Serrano, an 18-year-old UMass student and activist who called on the crowd with a similar message. \u201cWhat is the solution to all of this violence, racism and xenophobia?\u201d Serrano asked the crowd. \u201cA grassroots, multiracial, multiethnic movement of students and working people. We need to be organizing in our schools and workplaces. We need to be out in the streets. We need to be on strike every day.\u201d",

      "body": "Thursday's news that President-elect Joe Biden will tap Boston Mayor Marty Walsh for labor secretary took many pundits by surprise, as Walsh has been fundraising for another mayoral run and Biden faces calls to diversify his cabinet. But WBZ-TV Political Analyst Jon Keller said he thinks the news makes sense.\u201cThey\u2019re old pals, they have similar backgrounds \u2014 difficult childhoods marked by challenges, Biden [had] a severe stutter, Walsh [and] his battle with childhood cancer,\" Keller told GBH Morning Edition Host Joe Mathieu Friday. \"They went on to become successful adults with similar styles: schmoozers, dealmakers. Walsh is taking on a big job, and I think Biden wanted somebody in there that he really was simpatico with and knew he could trust.\u201dIf Walsh is confirmed, his departure for Washington would clear the way for a potentially large and diverse field of mayoral candidates this November. In accordance with city rules, Kim Janey \u2014 currently Boston City Council president \u2014 would assume the role of acting mayor, becoming the first woman and person of color to lead the city. According to Keller, this could well position her for a potential election victory in November, should she decide to run. Janey has not announced that she is entering the 2021 mayoral race. It's happened before. Keller recalled 1993, when President Bill Clinton appointed Boston Mayor Ray Flynn ambassador to the Vatican. Tom Menino, a little-known councilor from Hyde Park, became acting mayor. He went on to win the election in the fall and became the city's longest-serving mayor.\u201cYou wonder about history repeating itself,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI don't think very many Bostonians outside of her district know very much about Kim Janey. I think once they get to know her, they're going to like her.\u201dWatch: Keller on Janey being his early frontrunner for mayorRaw HtmlTwo candidates \u2014 city councilors Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell \u2014 have already officially jumped into the mayoral race. But, Keller said, the field could grow significantly in the coming months. He said he's keeping an eye on city councilors Annissa Essaibi-George, Michael Flaherty, and Matt O\u2019Malley, state senators Mike Rush, Nick Collins and Sonia Chang-D\u00edaz, Sheriff Steve Tompkins, and State Representative Nika Elugardo.As for Walsh, Keller said he expects his confirmation as labor secretary to be a breeze, especially after the upset in Georgia that gave Democrats control of the Senate. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be hard-pressed to find traction against Marty Walsh,\u201d Keller said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a slam dunk.\u201d",

      "body": "In the U.K., public health officials are now trying to get a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine into as many people as possible. To do that, they're changing the timeline for administering the vaccine. Some leading public health officials are suggesting we try the same strategy here in Massachusetts. GBH News Reporter Craig LeMoult discussed the proposal with GBH All Things Considered Host Arun Rath. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: So what is the proposal, exactly?Craig LeMoult: Well, there's been a few different ideas, actually, that public health experts have been floating recently, and they're generating some real debate. One was cutting the vaccine dose in half, so there's twice as much to go around. And there's some data suggesting that might have the same efficacy, but it's unproven at this point. The vaccines are designed so that people get a second shot after a few weeks. It's 28 days for Moderna, 21 days for the Pfizer vaccine. The idea that seems to be getting the most traction right now is the idea of lengthening the time between the doses. So this is actually what they're trying in Britain. They're giving the first shot out to as many people as possible. And then, once it's widely distributed and more vaccine is made, they're going to start giving the second doses, and that could take months. And that hasn't been studied in the clinical trials. Dr. Mark Lipsitch supports this idea. He's at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and he's on Gov. Baker's vaccine advisory committee.Clip from Dr. Mark Lipsitch: My understanding is that the choice of the three to four weeks in the trials was made because they wanted to do the trials quicker and get an answer quicker, which was a very good reason to pick that interval. But there's nothing magical about those dates.And he said there's no evidence the efficacy of the first shot would drop off sharply after a few weeks without that second shot. Rath: Do we know what federal health officials have to say about this proposal? LeMoult: On Monday, the FDA put out a statement saying they do not support any of the proposed changes to the vaccine dosing. The statement says the 28-day interval is what's been studied for the Moderna trial and there's just not adequate scientific evidence to support changing that. They said we just can't say from the existing data that this provides as much protection. I talked about this with Dr. Lindsey Baden of Brigham and Women's Hospital. He's one of the lead investigators of the Moderna trial. The Brigham has enrolled more than 600 people in the trial. He agrees with the FDA. He says there's just not enough data right now to move forward with this other proposal, and he says this actually wouldn't address the real challenge we're having getting vaccinations right now, which is a distribution issue. Clip from Dr. Lindsey Baden: The problem is, how do we give the doses that we already have? And after we give the doses that we have, then we can say, what do we need to do to extend it? But to say that let's give a unproven regimen when we can't even deliver the proven regimen that's available, I'm not sure we're thinking it through or solving the right problem.On Thursday, Gov. Baker said there have been 329,000 vaccine doses shipped into the state. So far, less than half of those doses have been administered.Rath: Thinking along the same lines, because vaccine distribution is on the states, it will be Massachusetts' decision on whether or not to do this. Do we have a sense of whether this different vaccine distribution regimen could happen in Massachusetts? LeMoult: I talked to several hospitals this week that are currently giving vaccines to frontline health care workers, and they are all planning on giving the second dose. And Gov. Baker addressed this question earlier this week, whether the state could possibly change its strategy. He said a lot of people have already been really nervous about this whole vaccine development process, but it's now clear that the current protocol for the vaccine is about 95% effective. So he said before the state changes anything, you'd have to hear a detailed explanation from the federal government about how and why they'd mix things up. Right now, it doesn't look like that's coming. But one epidemiologist I spoke with this week who's actually against the idea acknowledged that in Britain, where they're already doing this, they're seeing a spike in cases of this new, more highly contagious variant of the coronavirus. He said we could be seeing that in a couple of weeks, and that could change the whole calculus about whether to try something different. ",

      "body": "President-elect Joe Biden formally announced on Friday that Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is his pick for labor secretary. In his announcement, Biden referred to Walsh as a \"good friend and a stand-up guy\" who is \"tough as nails.\" Biden cited Walsh's experience as a union president and said the Boston mayor has \"always put working people first \u2014 fighting for $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, providing frontline workers with emergency child care and protective equipment they need,\" Biden said. \"Marty understands, like I do, the middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class.\" Biden said he seriously considered nominating Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to head the Labor Department, but with a tied Senate they couldn't take the chance of losing a special election.\"He agreed we couldn't take that chance,\" Biden said of Sanders. \"We also discussed how we'd work together, travel the country together, helping Marty, meeting with working men and women who feel forgotten left behind in this economy.\"In accepting the nomination, Walsh spoke of his parents' emigration from Ireland and credited his father's membership in the laborers' union with allowing him to be raised in Dorchester with \"dignity and security.\"\"I followed my father into that union,\" Walsh said. \"I learned what it took to turn an honest day's work into an honest day's pay. I saw what fighting for good jobs, good benefits, a safe workplace does for the lives of hard-working men and women and their families. And I fought for working people every single day of my life since then.\"Walsh said first responders, grocery store workers, sanitation workers and other working people have been \"holding the country together\" under impossible conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. But he said their challenges aren't new.\"Working people have been struggling for a long time under the erosion of their rights, and the deep inequalities of race, gender and class,\" Walsh said. \"For the last four years, they've been under assault \u2014 attacks on their rights, their livelihoods and the unions that built the middle class. We are facing hard times, but nobody's tougher than the American worker. And now we have the opportunity to put power back in the hands of working people all across this country.\"Walsh also outlined some of his priorities in his new job.\"We can defend workers' rights, we can strengthen collective bargaining, we can grow union membership, we can create millions of good paying jobs with investments in infrastructure, clean energy and in high-tech manufacturing, along with the workforce training to help get those people into those good jobs.\"Walsh's nomination was celebrated by some labor organizations in Massachusetts, including the state AFL-CIO, the Greater Boston Building Trades Unions and the Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health.\"When he arrives at the Department of Labor, Secretary Walsh will fight hard to reverse the destructive, anti-worker policies enacted over the past four years, providing further evidence of Joe Biden\u2019s promise of being the 'strongest labor president' in American history,\" Massachusetts AFL-CIO President Steven A. Tolman said in a statement. \"We know that Marty Walsh will bring his unique experience and skillset to the Dept. of Labor and will lead the charge for a brighter tomorrow for all Americans across the United States.\"",

      "body": "It\u2019s still not clear who will run or when the elections will be held now that Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is officially heading to Washington to become President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s labor secretary. But a pair of new endorsements from Boston City Council Michelle Wu, the first candidate to officially enter the 2021 Boston mayor\u2019s race, could strengthen her standing as voters start turning their focus from national to local politics.On Saturday, Wu announced she\u2019d received the backing of Elizabeth Warren, the U.S. senator and former presidential candidate. In a press release, Warren called the councilor \u201ca tireless advocate for families and communities who feel unseen and unheard\u201d and \u201ca woman who gets out and does the work that needs to be done.\u201dWarren\u2019s endorsement wasn\u2019t a surprise, exactly. In 2009, Warren was Wu\u2019s contracts-law professor at Harvard Law School. And in 2012, when Warren challenged then-Sen. Scott Brown, Wu served as her statewide constituency director, charged with building support in underrepresented communities. Still, it\u2019s by far the highest-profile endorsement to date in a race that currently includes Wu and Boston City Councilor Andrea Campbell.On Monday, Wu will be endorsed by Sunrise Movement Boston, the local arm of the Sunrise Movement, the youth-focused climate activism group.Kendall Damon, a Sunrise Boston spokesperson, said the endorsement was driven by Wu\u2019s attentiveness to housing, food security, public transit and climate change, as well as her conviction that these policy areas are intimately related.Module\u201cMichelle Wu is absolutely zeroing in on these issues,\u201d Damon said. \u201cShe has put forth a bunch of really bold policy proposals that really suggest structural change to the city of Boston, with the recognition that Boston is one of the richest cities in America but that is not equitably distributed whatsoever.\u201dCompared to Warren\u2019s endorsement, the value of Sunrise Boston\u2019s backing might not be immediately obvious. According to Damon, the group has about 600 members, many of whom don\u2019t live in Boston proper. But Damon says that, in Sunrise Boston, Wu is getting a ready-made cadre of motivated, experienced activists ready to flex their organizational muscle for her campaign.\u201cCity elections, whether we like it or not, [come] down to turnout, just because of the really low turnout rates for local elections, and that\u2019s kind of what the Sunrise organizing machine is all about,\u201d Damon said. \u201cWe campaign early, call folks, we knock on doors, and we would be mobilizing our entire hub \u2014 and potentially Sunrisers from all over America \u2014 to really help Michelle spread the word.\u201cSunrise basically adds an army to Michelle\u2019s campaign,\u201d she added.Wu welcomed Sunrise Boston's endorsement in an interview with GBH News.\"We need bold, urgent leadership that is grounded in community,\" Wu said. \u201cSunrise has been, locally and nationally, leading the way towards the vision that we are holding up, of racial and economic justice, and centering our communities and the people most impacted in these crises,\u201d Wu said.Last year, Sunrise Boston backed Sen. Ed Markey, who co-authored the Green New Deal climate plan with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in his Democratic primary contest with then-Rep. Joe Kennedy.Damon, who became active in Sunrise Boston during that campaign, cites her own experience as a case study in the group\u2019s effectiveness.\u201cI heard about Sunrise and the Ed Markey campaign early in the summer because of their complete blast on social media \u2014 Instagram, TikTok, Twitter,\u201d she said.  \u201cThen I signed up for a phone bank. I joined the phone bank. And the passion is so palpable with Sunrise, when we have candidates like Ed Markey and Michelle Wu who we know can be our allies \u2026 and as a result, It really just loops you in.\u201d Wu was previously endorsed by Jay Gonzalez, the former Democratic candidate for governor. Campbell has been endorsed by former Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral.It\u2019s still not clear when Walsh plans to officially step down as mayor. If he leaves before March 5, Boston\u2019s city charter would require a special election to fill Walsh\u2019s post, preceded by a preliminary election if more than two candidates seek the job. The preliminary and final special elections would likely occur in May and June, respectively.The winner would then face another election cycle this fall, with a final election in November and \u2014 if the field has three or more candidates \u2014 a preliminary election in September. However, Boston City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo has suggested waiving the requirement for a special election, a move that would require the approval of the state legislature. Now that Walsh has announced he\u2019s heading to Washington, several other politicians may enter the mayoral fray, including Boston City Council President Kim Janey; state Sen. Nick Collins; at-large Boston City Councilor Annissa Essabi George and state Rep. Jon Santiago.Janey, who's in line to become acting mayor when Walsh exits, would be the first woman and first person of color to run the city.",

      "body": "A new more highly contagious strain of the coronavirus, first identified in the United Kingdom, is spreading in the United States Last week Texas, Pennsylvania and Connecticut announced they had detected the new strain, joining California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, and New York.And while the Massachusetts Department of Public Health said on Monday that no labs in the state had detected evidence of variant strains yet, Gov. Charlie Baker has said that his administration is assuming the more contagious mutation is already here.Dr. William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees with Baker.\u201cThere are increasing numbers coming in from all over the country,\u201d Hanage said. \u201cSo we can be pretty sure that it's here. But the great thing is that right now it's rare. And what that means is that we can do stuff to keep it rare.\u201dHanage said that while the new U.K. coronavirus strain, officially known as B.1.1.7, is around 50 percent more transmissible, it doesn\u2019t appear to cause more severe disease. And he said that, the more transmissible something is, the more of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to control it. It apears that the newly-approved vaccines will be effective against the new strain, too, Hanage added. So what can we do to contain new strain?Several Massachusetts epidemiologists agree that current safety measures can keep the new strain from running rampant and causing hospitalizations and deaths to rise even higher.\u201cAll the tools we have now will work and will continue to work,\u201d said epidemiologist Andrew Lover of the UMass Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences. \u201cIt's just the level of adherence and attention to detail has to be that much higher.\u201d\u201cSo if you've been going to the grocery twice a week or three times a week, you know, really think carefully about doing a single trip,\" Lover said, reiterating that masks remain an important tool to fight transmission of the virus. \"So I think it's going to be taking a more cautious approach, and really thinking carefully about all of your activities in detail, and then trying to minimize any mixing with people outside of your bubble.\u201dThe new B.1.1.7 strain is one of several new strains detected recently, including one in South Africa, but they all share common features. Lover said the new strain's increased contagiousness seems to come from a change to the virus\u2019 spike protein that makes it easier for the virus to get a foothold inside a person\u2019s body when it\u2019s inhaled. He also said data from the U.K. show that people have ten to 100 times more virus in their nose and mouth with the new strain. But none of that means the virus can get through a mask any easier or last longer in the air, says Dr. Joshua Barocas, an assistant professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine and an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center. \u201cWe have to remember that we all are tired,\u201d Barocas said, \u201cThis has been an exhausting experience and a traumatic experience for nearly everyone. And so myself and other public health professionals and government officials need to say, \u2018Listen, we understand that you're tired. Here are the things that you can do to keep yourself safer.\u2019 Safer means trying your best to wear that mask when you're at the grocery store, knowing that maybe you are going to end up standing four feet away instead of six feet away.\u201dBarocas said in the face of the new more contagious coronavirus strain, it\u2019s important to get people to reduce their risk, not necessarily to roll back to more stringent shutdowns.The new strain was identified in the U.K. with the help of a robust virus surveillance program, and Barocas says a national surveillance program here, to track genomic variants of viruses and bacteria, would be \u201cincredibly useful.\u201d\u201c[It] would help us with not just this pandemic, but pandemic preparedness in general,\u201d Barocas said. \u201cI think that should be a priority for the Biden administration. Improving our infectious disease surveillance infrastructure is vital to getting through this pandemic. But most certainly it is vital to preventing the next one, and being prepared in the event that we're unable to prevent the next.\u201dHanage said 2021 should end in a better place, but he urged caution.\u201cThe numbers of deaths per capita in Massachusetts are getting close to the point where one in 500 residents of the state has died from the pandemic already,\u201d Hanage said. \u201cAnd you know that the cases are continuing to accumulate and climb. ... We have time to go until the vaccine is rolled out. ... Even though we have reason to be hopeful in due course, that's no reason to let our guard down now.\u201d",

      "body": "UMass Memorial Health Care employee Therese Duke lost her job this week after a viral video appeared to show her assaulting a police officer during last Wednesday\u2019s riot at the U.S. Capitol.Experts say Duke's case is more clear-cut, since she was an employee at a private company and was caught on camera seemingly engaged in violence. But even public employees who are protected by their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble could be at risk of losing their jobs for so much as taking part in such violent demonstrations, according to labor attorneys who spoke to GBH News. \u201cAny level of involvement is going to put someone at risk at this point \u2014 particularly because of what happened last week \u2014 if there are more activities planned and someone with full knowledge has any active involvement,\u201d Oren Sellstrom, an attorney with Lawyers for Civil Rights, told GBH News on Monday. \u201cI think a public employer would be within rights to terminate that person for any kind of active involvement.\u201d Private employers like UMass Memorial have much more leeway when it comes to terminating employment, Sellstrom said, because employment-at-will states, including Massachusetts, allow employers to fire employees at any time for any reason, or for no reason at all. \u201cThere are slightly different legal rules that apply to the two categories, but private employers can terminate employees for many different reasons, and the First Amendment doesn't apply,\u201d Sellstrom said. \u201cThe First Amendment is about government regulation, so in general, employees are not covered in that way if it's a private employer.\u201d Public and federal employees are protected by the First Amendment and might have unions that could make a case for an employee taking part in such a demonstration. But if the action became violent and criminal acts were conducted, that case doesn\u2019t hold much water, Sellstrom says. \u201cI think that's where it would have to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, but certainly I think the argument can be made that what started as a protest and pure speech ended up very quickly involving violent behavior,\u201d Sellstrom said. \u201cThat link is going to be relatively easy for public employers to draw if they want to.\u201d A violent mob of pro-Trump extremists attacked the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday, firing weapons, destroying property and pushing past police and security. Five people died during the insurrection, and several police officers were injured. In response, Andrew Lelling, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, said any state residents who took part in storming the Capitol will be prosecuted. \u201cThe Constitution protects the right to freedom of speech and assembly. What [it] does not protect is a violent assault on government institutions. Americans on the right and left must re-learn the difference,\u201d Lelling said in a statement Thursday. \u201cAnyone who traveled from Massachusetts with the intent to commit such crimes will be prosecuted in the District of Massachusetts.\u201dBoston-based labor and employment attorney Joshua Robbins, who mainly works on private employment cases, says participation in Wednesday\u2019s riot and any possible future actions could result in job termination \u2014 even for those who didn\u2019t actively engage in violence. \u201cThey're focused on the big fish right now, but it is going to trickle down,\u201d Robbins told GBH News on Monday. \u201cWith social media, with cameras, frankly, it could be three, six months, and then all of a sudden this is at a protester's doorstop, and they thought they were in the clear.\u201d Monica Shah, an employment attorney with Zalkind Duncan & Bernstein LLP, says there\u2019s a \u201cfine line\u201d between violence committed at the Capitol and the protesters who nonviolently participated in what became a violent action. \u201cIndividuals have a lawful right to protest peacefully, and that should be something that is supported by employers,\u201d Shah told GBH News on Monday. \u201cOn the other hand, if it turns into violence, if it turns into something that results in unlawful conduct, then employers may have the right to take actions based on that.\u201d The Massachusetts Civil Rights Act prevents private entities from interfering with an individual\u2019s right to demonstrate, Shah says, but evaluating grounds for termination becomes murky when an employee took part in an event that became rife with criminal activity. \u201cI don't think it's as clear whether there's physical acts or whether someone's crossed the physical steps of the Capitol, because there is the inciting piece of things that is criminal in nature,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThis kind of conduct could result in conspiracy charges, where somebody could think they were engaged in peaceful activity because of their involvement, but they could be swept into charges like that.\u201d Shah said employers, particularly public ones, should issue guidelines to their employees detailing what conduct is permissible. \u201cIf [employees] are speaking out on a matter of public concern and protesting and not engaged in an attempt at insurrection or anything else criminal, they should be protected,\u201d Shah said. \u201cI think what employers and public employers may be trying to figure out is, is there a distinction between people who were there and present and those who ran into the Capitol and potentially wanted to overthrow the government? Is there a distinction between those two?\u201d If a public employee is terminated based on their involvement at a riot, employers \u201cwill have to go through a process of potentially establishing that the employee was not engaged in lawful First Amendment protected activity but was in fact engaged in criminal activity that warrants termination,\u201d Shah said. \u201cSo it's a process, I think, for public employees and employers to have to go through.\u201dFollowing Wednesday\u2019s action, some pro-Trump extremists have threatened an \u201carmed march\u201d on Capitol Hill and in every state capital a few days before the inauguration. \"Many of Us will return on January 19, 2021, carrying Our weapons, in support of Our nation's resolve, towhich [sic] the world will never forget!!!\" one person wrote on Parler, a site friendly to right-wing extremists. \"We will come in numbers that no standing army or police agency can match.\"Robbins said the safest bet to avoid negative employment consequences would be to skip any upcoming protests that could devolve into a riot, but \u201cif you're adamant about going down, I think I would spend time thinking about how this all has escalated in the past four years,\u201d he said. When all the risks are accounted for, including safety, employment and possible criminal issues, Robbins offered this advice: \u201cStay away, if possible. Find something else to do.\u201d ",

      "body": "There are several dozen bills sitting on Governor Charlie Baker's desk following the Massachusetts legislature's mad dash to pass legislation before the end of their two-year session last week. One of those bills would aim for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but Baker has still not indicated whether or not he will sign it into law. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with GBH News State House reporter Mike Deehan about where Baker stands on the climate change bill as well as some of the other bills now on the governor's desk. The transcript below has been edited for clarity.Joe Mathieu: Does the governor have reservations about this [climate change] bill, or is it just taking a while? Mike Deehan: He does on the particulars of it. It's a very Baker kind of way \u2014 he has his plan and the Democrats have theirs, and he would prefer his, essentially, is what it boils down to. Whether that boils over into rejecting the bill, vetoing it, or in this case, just letting it die, it remains to be seen whether or not Baker wants to do that. He doesn't oppose this goal of a net-zero Massachusetts. He wants essentially the same thing the Democrats want here, and that is to get to no net emissions by 2050. That's the big long term plan. But he rolled out his own plan last month that has 45 percent of the 1990 levels of emissions by 2030. That's kind of the big first step over the next nine years. That's opposed to the legislature's 50 percent in their legislative plan. So it's five percent off, and that's the margin that we're dealing with here. Baker is really focusing on affordability; he doesn't want to see spikes in electricity prices from bringing on more expensive or cleaner sources of power. And he wants a freer hand in getting to that net-zero plan. He wants to keep the authority in the executive instead of having the legislature dictate. It should also be noted that Baker's spearheading this new regional alliance of states to cap emissions, and that will essentially raise the price of gas. So it's more about competing plans and it is competing goals. Watch: Is 2021 the year for sports betting in Massachusetts? Raw HtmlMathieu: Mike, I don't know if we should talk about this, but it's an open contest, it looks like, if Mayor Walsh goes to Washington, as he's planning to do. But as far as Beacon Hill is concerned, how about this proposal to eliminate a special mayoral election? Is that making waves? Is that of any controversy? Deehan: It's starting some chatter up on Beacon Hill. It's one of these home rule petitions where first it has to pass the Boston City Council, then it will go to the legislature and the governor. So that means that every lawmaker across the state \u2014 in the Senate, in the House and Governor Baker \u2014 needs to approve this thing or they need to vote on it. So that's not exactly just Boston's business anymore. Councilor Arroyo will file this petition that will make its way to Beacon Hill. Some folks are talking about getting that through the legislature. It would have to be something of a rush job. There's really no telling how fast they'd have to do that before March, [and] Beacon Hill doesn't work that fast. I reached out to Chairman Aaron Michlewitz from the North End who's actually the top member of the Boston delegation and he didn't even respond to the question. So he's keeping his cards quite close to him. These home rule petitions don't get very far in the State House very often. Even a lot of Walsh's priorities die noble deaths on the other floors of the State House. So you're really going to have to look towards people like Michlewitz [and] like Sonia Chang-D\u00edaz in the Senate, to push this forward. Not necessarily because they want to run for mayor, but because they want to make this as smooth as possible for the city of Boston. ",

      "body": "When COVID first arrived in the U.S., Jodee Pineau-Chaisson was working as the director of social services for a nursing home near where she lives in Chicopee, in western Massachusetts. By April and May, residents at her nursing home were getting sick. \u201cI was asked to go on to the COVID units to do FaceTime calls, so they could say goodbye to their family members,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was very scared.\u201dBut she felt like she owed it to the residents. So, at 55 years old and with no pre-existing conditions, Pineau-Chaisson put on a mask and white jumpsuit. Three days later, she had COVID-19. A few days after that, she was in the emergency room and gravely ill. A week or two later, when things started to improve, Pineau-Chaisson remembers thinking to herself, \u201cWithin a couple of weeks I'll be back to work.\u201d That didn\u2019t happen. Pineau-Chaisson is a so-called \u201clong-hauler.\u201d These are people who got COVID and, months later, still have symptoms despite testing negative for the virus. Experts are still figuring out exactly what\u2019s causing the long-term symptoms and how many people now fall into this category. However, one thing is certain: Even after the worst of the pandemic has subsided, society will have a new group of people dealing with long-term medical challenges and, experts say, the scale of the impact in areas like disability insurance is hard to predict.\u201cIf we end up with a million people with ongoing symptoms that are debilitating, that is a tremendous burden for each of those individuals, but also for our health care system and our society,\u201d said Dr. Steven Martin, a professor of family medicine and community health at UMass Medical School. The Medical QuestionsEight months after being released from the hospital, Pineau-Chaisson still has a long list of symptoms: brain fog and memory issues; body pain and heart palpitations; depression and chronic fatigue.\u201cSometimes it can even be hard to walk up the stairs to my bedroom,\u201d she said.\u201cWhy do we have long haulers? This is the very big question. We do not know,\u201d said Dr. Zeina Chemali, director of the neuropsychiatry clinics at Mass General Hospital. Recently, she\u2019s been running a clinic focused specifically on long-haulers. She said it\u2019s hard to know exactly how many COVID long-haulers there are since research is still being done. While some believe as many as 10 percent of COVID survivors will have persistent symptoms, Chemali said early studies from Europe suggest it may be between three and five percent. \u201cThis is not the first time in history that we see those neuropsychiatric, neurocognitive complications,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we put it under this bigger rubric of a post-viral syndrome.\u201dShe said it\u2019s akin to the long-lasting consequences that can come from lyme disease or encephalitis. Chemali\u2019s clinic is looking into whether COVID puts your brain at risk over the long-term for things like strokes and neuro-degenerative disease. She says they don\u2019t yet know the answer.Despite such major possible consequences, Martin predicted much of the care for long-haulers will fall to primary care physicians. \u201cIt really will make zero sense to refer someone to 17 different specialists to address their concerns,\u201d he said. He argued that primary care providers will need new training and tools to help this growing group of people facing an array of challenges.At Chemali\u2019s clinic they are trying treatments such as cognitive rehabilitation and medications \u2014 like stimulants \u2014 and, she said, that seems to help. But for some, it\u2019s not enough for them to be able to work.The Disability Questions\u201cWe are really pushing to get the system to help us by placing accommodations for people when they want to go back to work,\u201d Chemali said. \u201c[Long-haulers] might need to have less hours, better shifts, have more assistance at work.\u201dWhen needed, Chemali\u2019s team also helps their patients get the documentation needed to apply for disability benefits through the Social Security Administration. But experts aren\u2019t certain what the process will be like to actually get those benefits.\u201cIt's still an open question. It's still a little iffy whether people will be able to qualify,\u201d said Linda Landry, an attorney at the Disability Law Center in Massachusetts. Whether or not long haulers can access disability benefits is a hot topic in the advocacy community. It seems clear that long-haulers qualify for protections under the Americans with Disability Act, Landry and her colleague Rick Glassman said. This would afford them accommodations for things like housing and accessing government services. What is less clear is if they can access benefits through Social Security Disability Insurance. Landry said there are three big things you need to qualify: First, a medical diagnosis. Second, evidence that the condition affects your ability to work. And third, the disability has to last for a while. The requirement is that \u201cyou have to have had \u2014 or are likely to have \u2014 a condition that affects your ability to work for 12 consecutive months,\u201d Landry said. Since COVID hasn\u2019t been in the U.S. that long, she said, this may be hard to prove. She\u2019d like to see the Social Security Administration (SSA) put out some guidance on how to think about COVID-19 long-haulers \u2014 similar to what the SSA has done for headaches and fibromyalgia. \u201cIt's really important that the Social Security Administration get ahead of this and start studying it now,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \u201cAs far as I know, there's been no public word from the Social Security Administration.\u201dThe SSA didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Romig is hoping SSA experts are conferring with medical experts at the National Academy of Sciences to understand the latest research and treatment options. But, she said, with no word from the SSA and scientists still learning about long-haulers, it is impossible to predict what this will mean for how many long-haulers will qualify for benefits and what it means for finances of the program.\u201cWe really don't know, and we just can't know right now,\u201d said Romig.But Pineau-Chaisson in Chicopee isn\u2019t waiting for the official word. After running through her short-term disability insurance, the nursing home where she worked and contracted COVID-19 fired her, she said, for having debilitating long-term symptoms. So, Pineau-Chaisson got a neuro evaluation and sent in her application for disability benefits. \u201cThey said it could take two weeks to 10 months and many times they'll deny you the first time,\u201d she said.But she said if denied, she\u2019ll just keep appealing the decision and hope for the best. She said she knows she\u2019s not alone. She said the person who did her neuro evaluation had just done evaluations for four other COVID-19 long-haulers.",

      "body": "A nine-year dean of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's business school who now holds the flagship campus' top development role will take over next week as the interim chancellor of UMass Dartmouth.UMass President Marty Meehan announced Tuesday that Mark Fuller, the vice chancellor for advancement at UMass Amherst and former dean of UMass Amherst's Isenberg School of Management, will step into the Dartmouth job on Jan. 19.Fuller will take the reins from Mark Preble, who has been leading the 8,500-student campus since last summer. Former chancellor Robert Johnson resigned after three years in the job to become president of Western New England University.The UMass Board of Trustees does not need to sign off on Meehan's interim chancellor selection, and a UMass spokesman said a search for a permanent Dartmouth chancellor is not currently scheduled, which leaves the length of Fuller's run open-ended for now.Describing himself as \"inspired by UMass Dartmouth's mission, energy, and momentum,\" Fuller said in a statement that he looks forward to getting to know the school community and learning from students, faculty and South Coast neighbors.\"As a first-generation, working class student and a young man who was unsure of what he wanted to do with his life, it took the guidance of mentors and hands-on work experience to chart my academic and career pathway,\" he said. \"I was fortunate to find both at the University of Arizona, and those experiences very much informed my choice to pursue a career in public higher education.\"Fuller has been at UMass since 2009, leading the Isenberg School until he moved on to the vice chancellor role in 2018. Before coming to Massachusetts, he was a professor and information systems department chair at Washington State University and had previously taught at Baylor University.He holds bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees from the University of Arizona and, according to UMass, is a first-generation college graduate who, with support from his widowed mother, dealt with the cost of his education by working as a cardiac technician and taking out loans.\"UMass Dartmouth is a university to watch, and at this time of an unprecedented public health challenge, proven, passionate leadership is needed to continue this exciting trajectory and provide a world class education to our students,\" Meehan said. \"UMass Dartmouth is also the heart of the South Coast region, and Mark Fuller understands the university's economic impact on the community.\"UMass Dartmouth is home to the only public law school in Massachusetts and offers more than 90 undergraduate programs. Half of its undergrads are first-generation students, and 41 percent demonstrate the degree of financial need that makes them eligible for federal Pell grants.UMass Trustee Stephen Karam, a principal of the Karam Financial Group in Fall River, said the school serves as a major regional employer, a talent pipeline for local businesses and \"a key partner in the economic development of the South Coast.\"He said Fuller \"has a proven record of working closely with business leaders to build a university community that values the input of industry and ensures that students graduate with the skills they need for the high-wage, high-growth jobs of the future.\"",

      "body": "The Boston Bruins announced Tuesday that they will retire the number of Willie O'Ree, who made history when he suited up for the team on Jan. 18, 1958, as the first Black player in the NHL. O'Ree will be only the twelfth player to have his sweater retired by the club. Speaking to reporters, O'Ree said he was at a loss for words when Bruins president Cam Neely called and told him the news. \"And I said, 'I'm overwhelmed, and I'm thrilled about having my Bruins jersey hung up in the rafters,\" he said. The team plans to retire the number O'Ree primarily played with during his time in Boston, #22, before their game against the New Jersey Devils on Feb. 18. Although O'Ree broke barriers in the NHL only a little over a decade after Jackie Robinson first played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, hockey has been slow in recognizing him for his achievements. A story he shared about the NHL inviting him to the All Star Game in 1991 highlights the patience O'Ree's had to have over the years. \"And when I picked up the phone and answered, I said, 'Well, why are you inviting me?' I said 'I haven't played in 30 years,'\" O'Ree said. \"And he says, 'Well, we realize that you broke the color barrier, and we'd like to invite you to the All Star Game.' So, my wife and I went, had a great time. But that was 30 years after I left the league. So, you know, sometimes things take a little longer.\"Speaking to reporters, Bruins general manager Don Sweeney was hopeful that precautions the team has to take because of the COVID-19 pandemic won't diminish O'Ree's moment.\"As an organization, the legacy of the Boston Bruins, I think that we need to pay tribute in the best fashion we possibly can in these times and thank Willie overall for his contributions to our organization, but really to the entire National Hockey League,\" Sweeney said. Cam Neely echoed those sentiments in a statement following the announcement of the jersey retirment.\u201cOn behalf of the Boston Bruins organization, I would like to congratulate Willie O\u2019Ree as well as his wife, Deljeet, and his daughter, Chandra, on having his number retired in the TD Garden rafters,\u201d Neely said. \u201cWillie\u2019s contributions to the game of hockey transcend on-ice accomplishments and have opened countless doors for players who have come after him. He is without question deserving of this honor.\u201dO'Ree's gone on to become an an ambassador for the game, and he had a street hockey rink named in his honor in Allston in 2018. And O'Ree, who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018, isn't done yet. \"What I wanted to try do do was expose as many boys and girls as possible and give them the opportunity to play this sport,\" he said. \"And there are many clinics that I've attended just to let these boys and girls know that there is a sport that they can play. And if they come, if they don't like it, they can just walk away from it ... But I can honestly say, the number of clinics that I've conducted over the years, and once I get these boys and girls on the ice, I've not had one boy or girl come up to me and say, 'Oh, Mr. O'Ree, I don't like this, I'm not coming back.' So I've got a good record going.\"",

      "body": "Boston\u2019s planning agency is rolling out a new set of rules to ensure residents who don\u2019t speak English well or at all can participate in public meetings about proposed developments.Under the new policy, slated to go into effect early this year, the Boston Planning and Development Agency will require that those meetings and relevant materials be interpreted in the popular languages of the city\u2019s various neighborhoods.The BPDA has previously provided language translators on a case-by-case basis when specifically requested or deemed necessary. Brian Golden, the agency\u2019s director, said the policy is a response to demographic shifts.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a city that is increasingly diverse. The city is a radically different place today, demographically, than it was when I was growing up here,\u201d he said, pointing to past decades when Boston was mostly white.ModuleOn top of the more diverse population, Golden said the city is experiencing a building boom that has created more than 60 million square feet of new development in the past seven years. As that trend spreads out from downtown into neighborhoods, residents need to know what\u2019s happening, he said.\u201cIt is absolutely key that people understand the pros and cons of development,\u201d Golden told GBH News. \u201cIf we are not being understood, either because we\u2019re not explaining things well enough \u2026 or [because] we\u2019re not explaining things in a language that, literally, people can understand, that\u2019s a real problem.\u201d Boston has more than 111,000 adult residents who don\u2019t speak English well, according to recent BPDA data. Another 130,000 speak English \u201cvery well\u201d as well as speaking another language at home.Jose Vaz, who moved to Dorchester from Cape Verde in 2003, is one city residents with limited English proficiency. Vaz told GBH News through an interpreter that when he\u2019s not with bilingual friends or family, he mostly avoids people. It\u2019s discouraging, Vaz said, since he values being part of a community. Under the BPDA\u2019s new policy, Dorchester, Boston\u2019s largest and most diverse neighborhood, will require meetings be translated into four languages: Spanish, Vietnamese, Haitian creole and Cape Verdean creole.Through a translator, Vaz, 56, said the new policy and the regular availability of interpreters could be a sign that the city is seeking to hear and include all voices.Fostering equity in the public square through language access services has become a policy priority as Boston\u2019s immigrant population has grown. In the 1950s, foreign-born Bostonians made up about 15% of the city\u2019s population. Today that figure is closer to 30%.The city of Boston has stepped up its outreach to non-English speakers in recent years, forming an Office of Language and Communications Access that provides accessibility training to other city departments and helps finance activities like braille transcription, video captions and audio transcripts.  Dealing with this linguistic diversity has its costs. The BPDA told GBH News that for the current fiscal year, which began in July, it has spent $100,000 on language access services \u2014 and that amount will likely double. The Boston Public Schools, which were required to set up a language access policy in 2012 as part of a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, has budgeted $3 million for such services this year. Those in the language services industry said the city has come a long way since the days when non-English speakers were relegated to the rear corners of meeting rooms, where a non-certified interpreter might have offered loose translations of the proceedings.\u201cIt feels like we started in the stone age,\u201d Linda Barros, a local freelance translator, said with a chuckle. Barros, who moved to Dorchester in the 1980s, said meeting spaces frequently felt \u201cchaotic,\u201d with people straining to hear while two or three languages were spoken simultaneously. \u201cNow [non-English speaking] people will come in, and if they see headsets, they already know it\u2019s for them,\u201d she said, describing the modern audio systems that connect interpreters with their audiences.Barros added that English speakers have also learned to tone down their nativism. \u201cYou would have some rude people who would say, \u2018They need to learn how to speak English,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBack in the day they were not so soft and so politically correct.\u201dDiana Pagano, an operations executive with Interpreters and Translators Inc., said if governments don\u2019t continue to prioritize language access, they\u2019ll have dead communities. The company works with various agencies in the New England area.\u201cThis is a diverse world, and the fact that you have immigrants in our country not understanding the language, I think we\u2019re missing out,\u201d Pagano said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss out on a big, big community that can be contributors\u2026It\u2019s just about empowering them.\u201dGolden recognizes the BPDA\u2019s policy change could invite more public comments and more controversy around development projects, but he said it is ultimately in everyone\u2019s best interest. \u201cSignificant changes to the built environment are not without controversy, and we can only gain people's trust and support if they understand what we're doing,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "Updated 8:31 p.m.In his seventh and final state of the city speech, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh \u2014 who is leaving his job to become President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s secretary of labor \u2014 lamented the human toll taken by COVID-19 and touted his administration\u2019s response to the pandemic. Early in his address, Walsh noted that more than 1,000 Bostonians have died due to the coronavirus pandemic, and he mentioned three of them: Beverly Ann Rock, a Dorchester social worker; Regina Phillips, a Boston EMT assigned to Ambulance 19 in Mattapan; and Jose Fontanez, a Boston police officer who worked in Jamaica Plain. \u201cWe are a city aching with loss,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cNot a day goes by that I\u2019m not speaking with a grieving family member, a worker facing unemployment or a small business owner struggling to hang on.\u201d For Black, Latino and immigrant Bostonians, Walsh noted, the direct and indirect damage from COVID-19 has been especially acute. In response, the mayor said, his administration has taken a multitude of steps aimed at containing the virus\u2019s spread, including closing schools, pausing construction and canceling the Boston Marathon. \u201cThese decisions, and many others, were not easy,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cBut we had to act to save lives. So we worked with the state, with hospitals and universities, with businesses small and large, nonprofits and residents in every neighborhood \u2014 and we moved forward together, one day at a time.\u201d As Boston recovers from the pandemic, Walsh said, keeping the populace safe and getting Boston\u2019s public-school students back in the classroom are top priorities. He urged Bostonians to get vaccinated when possible and said his administration is working to soften the impact of remote learning on the city\u2019s most vulnerable students \u2014 for example, by providing laptops for every student and helping students who face food, clothing or housing insecurity. The city will also continue working to aid small businesses reeling from the pandemic, Walsh said, and has providing $26 million in resources to date. After touting Boston\u2019s ongoing efforts to increase housing stock and fight climate change, Walsh closed by focusing on his administration\u2019s response to George Floyd\u2019s murder by a Minneapolis policeman and the wave of protests demanding racial justice that followed it, in Boston and across the country. \u201cI thank Black Bostonians for the way you made your voices heard,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI thank everyone who joined the movement \u2014 Black, white, Latino, Asian and Indigenous people standing together.\"In response, Walsh said, his administration declared racism a public-health crisis, launched a health equity plan to address health disparities in the city, appointed a new chief of equity and embraced police reform, including the creation of the new Office of Police Accountability and Transparency. \u201cI\u2019m asking all of us to accept this responsibility as our own and commit to fighting racism,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s our deepest moral obligation, and it\u2019s our greatest opportunity for growth.\u201d Walsh, who fought back tears toward the end of his speech, vowed to make the Biden Administration \u201cthe best federal partner Boston and America\u2019s cities ever had.\u201d \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019m not going to Washington alone,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI\u2019m bringing Boston with me. This city is not just my hometown \u2014 it\u2019s my heart.\u201d Walsh addressed the audience remotely from the newly rebuilt Roxbury branch of the Boston Public Library in Nubian Square, immediately following a brief documentary about the last year of his mayoral tenure. According to the City of Boston Archives, Walsh\u2019s address continued a tradition that began in 1822 at Faneuil Hall, when John Phillips, Boston\u2019s first mayor, addressed the City Council. The speech seems to have been given every year since then, even during the Civil War. Walsh is also following in the footsteps of former Boston Mayor Maurice Tobin, who became President Harry Truman\u2019s labor secretary after first serving as governor of Massachusetts. The last Boston mayor to join a presidential administration was Raymond Flynn, who served as President Bill Clinton\u2019s ambassador to the Vatican. When Flynn exited City Hall in 1993, then-Boston City Council President Tom Menino became acting mayor. He was later elected to the job outright and went on to serve for two decades, the longest term of any Boston mayor. In Tuesday\u2019s speech, Walsh said he\u2019s already working on a mayoral transition of power with Boston City Council President Kim Janey, who will become the first woman and person of color to run the city if, as expected, Walsh\u2019s appointment is confirmed by the U.S. Senate. \u201cI am confident that the operations of city government, including our COVID response, will continue smoothly,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cAnd I want you to know, the work we\u2019ve done together for the past seven years has prepared Boston to build back stronger than ever.\u201d ",

      "body": "Milk Street's take on classic potato gnocchi was inspired by a cooking lesson they got in Paris from chef Peter Orr at his Robert restaurant in the 11th arrondissement. The trick to making light and fluffy pasta is in the technique. Use a ricer or food mill to get the smooth texture needed for light, delicate gnocchi. Ingredients:For the gnocchi: 2 3/4 to 3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks Kosher salt 146 grams (1 cup plus 2 tablespoons) all-purpose flour, plus more for shaping 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 1 large egg, lightly beaten For the sauce: 4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) salted butter, cut into 4 pieces, divided1/3 cup chopped fresh sage 1 recipe potato gnocchi 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives 2 tablespoons lemon juice Kosher salt and ground black pepperDirections:In a large pot, combine the potatoes and 4 quarts water. Bring to a boil over high, then stir in 2 tablespoons salt. Reduce to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes break apart when pierced with a knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and line the rack with kitchen parchment. Drain the potatoes in a colander, shaking the colander to remove excess water. Return the potatoes to the pot and cook over low, gently folding with a silicone spatula, until the potatoes look dry and slightly powdery and the bottom of the pot is coated with a thin film of potato starch, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to the prepared cooling rack in an even layer. Cool to room temperature. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Weigh out 1 1/4 pounds (about 4 cups) of the cooked potatoes into a large bowl; save the remainder for another use. Discard the parchment from the baking sheet, then line with fresh parchment and coat with 1 tablespoon of oil; set aside. Add 1 teaspoon salt to the potatoes and pass the potatoes through a ricer or a food mill fitted with the fine disk back into the bowl, or mash them with a potato masher until smooth. Sprinkle the flour mixture evenly over the mashed potatoes. Using your hands, lightly toss the potatoes to distribute the flour mixture. Add the egg and gently mix with your hands until incorporated. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and gently knead just until smooth; do not overknead. Using a bench scraper or knife, divide the dough into 4 pieces.Roll 1 piece of dough into a rope about 16 inches long, then use the dough scraper to cut it into 16 pieces. Place the pieces in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Dip the back of the tines of a fork into flour, then gently press into each piece to create a ridged surface. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Set a wire rack in another rimmed baking sheet and line the rack with kitchen parchment. Coat the parchment evenly with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water to a boil and stir in 3 tablespoons salt. Add half of the gnocchi, return to a boil and cook, stirring gently and occasionally, until the gnocchi float to the surface. Cook for 1 minute, then use a slotted spoon to transfer the gnocchi, letting excess water drain, to the prepared rack. Return the water to a boil and repeat with the remaining gnocchi. Let the gnocchi cool for at least 15 minutes before using. For the Butter, Sage & Chives Sauce: In a nonstick 12-inch skillet over medium, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the sage and cook, stirring, until fragrant and the butter just begins to brown, about 1 minute. Add the gnocchi and . cup water and bring to a simmer over medium-high, gently tossing with a silicone spatula. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and cook, swirling the pan to melt the butter, until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in",

This was likely Walsh's final address as mayor, following president-elect Joe Biden's announcement last week tapping Walsh as his nominee for Secretary of Labor. \u201cThis is the city that welcomed my immigrant parents,\u201d Walsh said in his speech. \u201cThis is the city that picked me up when I needed second chances. We have faced down big challenges together, just as we are doing with COVID. We have always prevailed, and we\u2019re not about to give up now.\u201dPeter Kadzis, GBH News political analyst, joined host Joe Mathieu on GBH's Morning Edition to reflect on Walsh's legacy and discuss his expected move to Washington.Watch: Kadzis on the emotion behind Walsh's state of the city addressRaw HtmlThe announcement from the Biden administration came as a surprise for some in Boston, as ongoing fundraising efforts suggested that Walsh would seek another term as mayor this November. But Kadzis says that he wasn\u2019t surprised, given Walsh\u2019s growth during his time leading the city. \u201cMarty Walsh has learned a lot in seven years and he has become a much more skillful politician than he was when he walked in the door,\u201d Kadzis said. \u201cGrowth is an interesting thing in politics. We all expect it; we rarely see it.\"TweetWalsh kept the rumors that he would take a post in Washington at bay for many months \u2014 which was a smart move, according to Kadzis. \u201cI think Walsh wanted this job so dearly that he used his now clearly political skills to just will away the rumors,\u201d Kadzis said. \u201cHe convinced everyone that he was staying. That was a smart thing to do, because it\u2019s not his choice to go there; it\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s choice.\u201dAmid record unemployment and a historic economic crisis, Walsh would step into the Secretary of Labor job at a critical time, but Kadzis believes he\u2019s up for the challenge. \u201cHe gets to play urban statesman, labor statesman. I think he\u2019ll enjoy that,\" Kadzis said. \"Let\u2019s not forget, he labored for years away from cameras as a labor leader. In some ways, he's returning to his roots here.\"Watch: Is Kadzis surprised Walsh is going to Washington?Raw HtmlIf Walsh is confirmed and departs for Washington, as is expected, City Council president Kim Janey would assume the role of acting mayor, putting her in a powerful position if she decides to run for a permanent post in November's election.\"Janey may have a smaller base in Roxbury [and] may not be as well known, but she will have the power of the incumbency,\u201d Kadzis said. \"Every single day \u2014 or two or three times a week \u2014 she'll be standing in front of the cameras and giving the COVID report. That's a very powerful and convenient platform.\" ",

      "body": "Massachusetts will deploy up to 500 National Guard personnel to Washington, D.C., to protect the capital city during the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, Gov. Charlie Baker announced on Thursday.The Executive Office of Public Safety and Security said in a statement the deployment will begin in the next few days. The governor also activated another 500 guardsmen to protect Massachusetts \"out of an abundance of caution\" and to support local law enforcement over the next week, though \"the Administration is not aware of any specific threats to Massachusetts at this time,\" the statement added.The announcement that Massachusetts troops will be deployed this week came during a wide ranging press conference in which the governor also addressed the climate change bill that recently passed the legislature, discussed a new grant program to help small business weather the economic downturn brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and answered questions about his role in the future of the Republican party.Baker was asked if he intends to take on a larger national role to advocate for more moderation within the GOP as his party rebuilds after President Donald Trump leaves office next week.\"If I can be helpful in a larger conversation about what I think of is the right way to play this so-called game, I'm happy to do that. But I don't want anybody to walk away thinking that I would ever use this position to leverage something else,\" Baker said, reiterating that he intends to serve out his full term ending in 2023.More immediately, Baker is contending with a climate change bill to drastically reduce the state's carbon emissions to \"net zero\" by 2050, meaning the state would switch to enough clean energy sources to cancel out green house gas emissions over the next three decades. The bill sets pathways for several industrial sectors, from housing and transportation to manufacturing and retail, to cut energy use, introduce clean fuels and electrify systems that currently burn natural gas and other carbon-emitting gases.Baker said Thursday he's concerned higher environmental standards in the state building code, as proposed in the bill, would raise the cost of building construction and hobble his effort to combat the housing crisis. Baker said aspects of the bill lawmakers passed at the end of their two-year session \"literally may just stop in its tracks any housing development in the Commonwealth.\"\"While we support many elements of that bill and have worked collaboratively with the folks in the Legislature on numerous climate initiatives, which is part of the reason why we're a national leader on this stuff, we've got to build more housing that's less expensive, not less housing that's more expensive,\" Baker said.The legislation will expire if Baker doesn't take action on it. Senate President Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ron Mariano have vowed to refile the bill, send it back to Baker's desk and override his veto if necessary.\"I think there is a desire and a necessity to continue to move forward the bill that we passed at the end of the session last, last session, last week, \" House Ways and Means Chairman Aaron Michlewitz told GBH News.Baker was visiting Ristorante Saraceno, a restaurant in Michlewitz's North End district, to announce another round of grants for small businesses suffering during the pandemic. The grant program will offer $78.5 million in direct support to retailers, indoor entertainment venues, eateries and other businesses that have lost revenue over the past year. Baker said the grants can be used to pay rent, utility bills, mortgages, staff payroll and to replace supplies businesses can no longer use.\"We know how important it is to get small businesses up and running and to help them work their way through this last turn of the pandemic and to make sure that by the time we get to the spring, they're still with us,\" Baker said.The grant program will offer $78.5 million in direct support to retailers, indoor entertainment venues, eateries and other businesses hit hard by the pandemic. Baker said the grants can be used to pay rent, utility bills, mortgages, staff payroll and to replace supplies businesses can no longer use.To date, the grant program has given out $195 million to over 4,100 small businesses. The grants are part of the $668 million COVID-19 Small Business Grant Program administered by the quasi-public financing agency Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation.\"We will be sending guard personnel to Washington, D.C. as part of the force that they're putting together for the inaugural activities,\" Baker said Thursday.A spokesman for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security wrote in a statement the deployment will begin in the next few days. The statement said Gov. Baker approved the request by the federal government and National Guard Bureau to back up the D.C. National Guard.\"This has been a lot of back and forth over the past 48 hours between between the guard here, the guard in D.C. and in some of our colleagues in local and state law enforcement here,\" Baker said before the deployment was formally announced.Baker also activated another 500 guardsmen to protect Massachusetts \"out of an abundance of caution\" and to support local law enforcement over the next week, according to the spokesman.\"The Administration is not aware of any specific threats to Massachusetts at this time and continues to work with partner agencies to maintain the multi-layered security plans in place to protect residents and centers of government,\" the statement said.On Beacon Hill, House and Senate lawmakers will have to refile a bill to drastically reduce the state's carbon emissions unless Baker has a change of heart over the legislation that will expire without his signature at the end of the day Thursday.Baker said Thursday he's concerned higher environmental standards in the state building code, as proposed in the bill, would raise the cost of building construction and hobble his effort to combat the housing crisis.

However, the world-renowned dancer and choreographer has another practice he\u2019s largely kept private: his painting. At the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, \u201cShen Wei: Painting in Motion\u201d highlights the artist\u2019s massive works on canvas, including two original pieces made during his 2018-2019 tenure as an artist-in-residence at the museum.\u201cThat in-between where images cohere and then dissolve, where they seem material and then dissolve into the ethereal, I think that's where Shen Wei lives,\u201d says museum director Peggy Fogelman. \u201cHis dance is similar in the sense that there's a kind of structure\u2026 but then within that there's all this chance and improvisation.\u201d\u201cDave Cole: New Landscapes,\u201d on view at UMass Dartmouth and virtually through their websiteDave Cole: New LandscapesUMass Dartmouth\u2019s University Art Gallery is now presenting, virtually and in-person, a new site-specific installation by artist Dave Cole. Titled \u201cNew Landscapes,\u201d the exhibition is filled with paintings obscured by fragments of windows from an old Pawtucket mill. The encaustic paintings themselves are created with a range of materials including beeswax, fire, and shoe polish, reflecting the dark, fiery and uncertain nature of our current political and environmental landscapes.\u201cMy generative process is very spontaneous,\u201d says Cole. \u201cThis idea has been percolating for a really long time. It was a sort of a corner-of-the-sketchbook sketch maybe ten years ago that's been following me around. And for whatever reason right now felt like the right time.\u201dWhat virtual programs are you seeing? Tell Jared about it on Facebook or Twitter!",

      "body": "Boston will be able to skip special elections and proceed directly to September's non-partisan primary and November's final contest, officials on Beacon Hill and at City Hall have told GBH News.Gov. Charlie Baker, who has the final word, said Thursday that he would most likely approve that plan.\u201cThey clearly will show deference to the voters of Boston in this case, I believe,\u201d Secretary of State Bill Galvin said earlier this week. Several influential Boston legislators who predict that the special election will be waved still wanted to keep a sage silence lest they be seen as trying to toy with a municipal election which, if history is any guide, will be bruising.According to Boston\u2019s city charter, a special election is required if Walsh leaves office before March 5. If, as expected, more than two candidates run, there would also be a special preliminary election to winnow the field down to two finalists. After those two elections are held, in the spring or early summer, there would then be another mayoral election in November, preceded by a September preliminary if the field includes more than two candidates. However, the special-election requirement can be waived if Boston sends a home-rule petition to Beacon Hill and it\u2019s passed into law. Galvin, the state\u2019s top election official, has already backed the idea, citing cost and potential voter confusion. \u201cI think the best course of action is for the City Council to have a very thorough discussion on this issue, promptly,\u201d Galvin said. While home-rule requests can languish on Beacon Hill, lawmakers recently backed a similar move in Lawrence, where former Mayor Dan Rivera just stepped down to lead the Massachusetts Development Financing Agency. On Jan. 7, the state House and Senate approved a proposal to waive a special election to replace Rivera, and Baker signed the change into law the same day. Spokespeople for Senate President Karen Spilka and House Speaker Ron Mariano have said that the two lawmakers would review any home-rule petition involving Boston\u2019s election calendar, as they do all such petitions. That debate in Boston began in earnest on Wednesday, when City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo introduced a motion for a hearing to discuss waiving the special-election requirement. In his remarks, Arroyo said the potential cost is especially worrisome since the COVID-19 crisis has depleted city coffers \u2014 and that, as the pandemic continues, a special election would also pose public-health risks. \u201cIn-person voting in four elections would require residents to leave their homes to participate in our electoral process, furthering the risk of spread and the danger to health of residents, city workers and our communities,\u201d Arroyo said. Arroyo also argued that a four-election cycle would be unfair to Boston\u2019s communities of color, who have been especially hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, and to other marginalized groups. \u201cLow-income, immigrant, disabled and communities of color continue to face systemic obstacles in trying to participate in our political system,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond one public-health emergency \u2026 four elections for the same office in the same year only increases those barriers and serves to limit their participation.\u201d While there\u2019s a good-government case to be made for nixing a special election, the move would also have clear political implications. Most notably, it could boost Council President Kim Janey \u2014 who\u2019ll become acting mayor when Walsh leaves \u2014 if she seeks the job permanently. Right now, the mayoral field includes two candidates, city councilors Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell. Both announced their bids in September 2020, when Walsh\u2019s plans were still unclear. They\u2019ve had months to campaign, fundraise, seek endorsements and build their organizations. If a special election is held, this would put Wu and Campbell in a position of strength relative to any other candidates, who\u2019d have to act quickly to be viable. That includes Janey, who\u2019s thought to be mulling a run of her own. Conversely, eliminating the special-election requirement would give other candidates more time to catch up to Wu and Campbell. It would also give Janey \u2014 who will be the first woman and the first person of color to lead Boston \u2014 more time to serve in the role before facing voters, which could boost her electoral prospects. In Wednesday\u2019s council hearing, City Councilor Frank Baker suggested that Arroyo\u2019s proposal is intended to help Janey\u2019s mayoral prospects. \u201cEven though we say it\u2019s about finance, and it\u2019s about COVID, and it\u2019s about this, it\u2019s about who is our person in the race and how does it benefit them directly,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think that that is the underlying reason.\u201d In that same hearing, City Councilor Lydia Edwards, who chairs the council\u2019s government-operations committee, said that while she has questions about the value of a possible special election, she\u2019s legally required to initiate the process when Walsh leaves unless the council acts. She also wished luck to Wu, Campbell and any other councilors who might seek the mayor\u2019s job, while wondering aloud why they\u2019d want it. \u201cI do not have a dog in this fight,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not want to be mayor of Boston. And good luck to those who really want to. I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s your dream, it\u2019s your life. YOLO, whatever the hell the kids say.\u201d The council will hold a hearing on eliminating the special-election requirement at a yet-to-be-determined date.",

      "body": "Massachusetts would need more than 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to fully inoculate everybody in the first phase of the Baker administration's three-tiered plan, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday.A Thursday report from the Department of Public Health shows that, as of Tuesday, a total of 347,450 doses had been shipped to Massachusetts, and 239,147 of those doses -- a little more than two-thirds -- have been administered.\"We are not holding on to any vaccine. Nobody's holding on to any vaccine,\" Baker said after signing a new hospital signage and safety law. \"We have 660,000 people in phase one. We've only received roughly 400,000 vaccine shots to begin with. Those 660,000 all need to get vaccinated twice, they need to get dosed twice to be vaccinated. You do the math, that's 1.3 million vaccine shots -- excuse me, doses -- to actually fully vaccinate phase one, which is supposed to end sometime in early February.\"Shots became available to first responders this week, and the next portion of phase one is set to begin next week, with vaccinations starting in congregate care settings including shelters, group homes and correctional facilities. The state's first large-scale vaccination site, at Gillette Stadium, is slated to open to first responders on Monday.Baker said he anticipates there will be four or five such mass vaccination sites set up around the state by the end of the month. The combination of those locations, pharmacies, health care providers and community health centers \"starts to look like the type of infrastructure that we'll need to start doing thousands and thousands and thousands of these every day,\" Baker said.\"But again, we need to know that the vaccine is actually going to be coming in volumes that are great enough to actually make sure that we can take advantage of that,\" he said.",

      "body": "Visiting nurses, many of whom are providing care inside the homes of COVID-19 positive patients, will now be able to get vaccinated in Massachusetts.That's a change in state policy, which had initially excluded visiting nurses from the phase-1 category of \"COVID-facing\" healthcare workers who were given first priority for the vaccine.\"These patients in the home are pretty sick, especially the ones with COVID,\" said Patricia Joyce, a registered nurse with the VNA Care network. \"And we see a great deal of COVID patients.\"VNA Care says its nurses have cared for about 570 COVID-19 positive patients, and Joyce said she's currently caring for about 10 of them \u2014 doing everything from taking care of IVs to educating patients about their diabetes or heart failure. \"Our goal is to prevent them from going back in the hospital,\" she said.Visiting nurses are at a greater risk for contracting COVID-19, she said, because providing care inside people's homes means entering an uncontrolled environment. Unlike hospitals, there's little control of who's coming and going and what precautions are taken.And unlike the nurses in hospitals, visiting nurses weren't given access to the vaccine until now. Initially, the state's priority list placed visiting nurses after congregate care settings in the timeline for vaccination. That timeline estimated those vaccinations would begin in February. Visiting nurses have been calling state officials asking for a higher prioritization. The COVID Command Center and Department of Public Health reviewed the timeline, in collaboration with the state's COVID Advisory Group, and decided to move visiting nurses up on the priority list.Pat Kelleher, executive director of the Homecare Alliance of Massachusetts, was notified of the change Friday. \"We're pleased that our nurses are now able to get vaccinated,\" Kelleher said. \"It may seem like a small difference, two or three weeks, but it's a big deal to these nurses who have been out there serving COVID-positive patients and, sort of, not being recognized as COVID-facing workers.\"Kelleher said visiting nurses can now go to the mass vaccination site at Gillette Stadium, which began vaccinating people on Friday.\"So I think those two things came together \u2014 a realization of what home health professionals were doing to help COVID and the opening of this super-site that has the ability to vaccinate so many people in a day.\"Vaccinating visiting nurses presents a logistical challenge, since an agency's staff could be spread out across the state. Kelleher said she's hoping that hospitals that refer patients to visiting nurse agencies will begin vaccinating those visiting nurses once they've finished with their own work forces. Several visiting nurse agencies have applied to the state to be permitted to administer vaccines, Kelleher said. She hoped they may be able to administer vaccine to their own staffs and nurses from other agencies.Home care workers providing non-medical care are not included in the change, and some in that industry say they're just as vulnerable and should be vaccinated now, too\"The work that these aides are doing is really just as critical as any of the work being done by anybody who is ahead of them in this phase-1 timeline,\" said Kevin Smith, president of the Home Care Aide Council and CEO and owner of Best Of Care, which employs about 400 home care workers. \"This group needs to get vaccinated very soon, because they are the ones who are actually keeping people from crowding the hospitals. The work they're doing is keeping people safe at home. And the people they're helping are really incredibly vulnerable.\"",

In the first six days of 2021, incessant false refrains of a stolen election rose to a crescendo with an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where throngs of Trump supporters disrupted the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's election victory \u2014 some adorned in white supremacist icons and flying Confederate flags. The Revs. Irene Monroe and Emmett Price joined Boston Public Radio on Monday, Martin Luther King Day, to reflect on King's words from his \"The Other America\" speech, urging us to own the truth that there are two Americas: one of prosperity and one of despair.Price said King speaks of genuine equality, which had not yet been obtained in 1968 and has still not yet been obtained today.\"It's been an aspiration of something phenomenal that has not been manifest yet,\" he said. \"I believe the aspiration of America should manifest that genuine equality. Anything other than that is unacceptable.\"Monroe and Price discussed how, in the immediate aftermath of the attack on the Capitol,  some turned to platitudes that the event does not reflect \"who we are\" \u2014 just as many have done in the past after horrific events where racism was an undeniable factor.Monroe said for many Black Americans, the truth is the exact opposite \u2014 that this is exactly what America has stood for, time and again, and that it is white Americans who keep choosing to forget the nation's ugly history.\"As Black people, we continue to perservere in the face of America's original sin,\" Monroe said. \"To remember is a radical act in and of itself,\" she added. \"The question is, who forgets? We're still fighting that battle ... Whether it's in the classroom or the board room or the courtroom.\"The Rev.

      "body": "Speaking Monday on Boston Public Radio, Imari Paris Jeffries said he\u2019s optimistic about the long-term impact of the city's latest string of antiracist measures, going as far as to say he believes Boston \u201cmight be the only city,\u201d or at least the first city, with a chance of fulfilling the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s vision of true social equality. Paris Jeffries is the executive director of King Boston, the group behind a forthcoming memorial to King, Coretta Scott King and other Civil Rights-era leaders on Boston Common. The 22-foot high sculpture, titled The Embrace, is scheduled to be finished sometime in the spring of 2022 and will commemorate the time King and others racial justice leaders spent in the city. ModuleKing famously studied theology at Boston University and met his wife, Coretta Scott, while she was studying voice at the Boston Conservatory. \"There\u2019s an alternate universe,\u201d Paris Jeffries imagined, where the two stuck around and made Boston the center of the 1960's Civil Rights Movement.\"And so this is our second chance to do that,\" he said, speaking about the work of groups like his, the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts, the Boston Foundation and the increasingly diverse city leadership. Boston's legacy on racial justice is notoriously dismal. A study conducted for a 2017 Boston Globe Spotlight series found Black Americans ranked Boston as the \u201cleast welcoming\u201d to people of color. That finding was compounded by data showing vast economic disparities between the median net worth of Black Bostonians and their white counterparts. Recent GBH investigations, too, revealed that Massachusetts state leaders failed to follow through on some of their most forward-facing antiracist initatives.But Paris Jeffries said he belives the city is making strides. \"Bostonians hear information, and we try to respond as best as we can,\" he said. \"I think the transformation of leadership is one response to that story.\"In addition to the memorial on Boston Common, King Boston is in the process of creating the King Center for Economic Justice in Roxbury, where workers will advocate for racial equity. On Monday night, the organization will also be debuting \u201cVoices on King,\u201d a documentary made in collaboration with the Museum of Fine Arts and Citizens Bank about the legacy of the two Civil Rights icons.",

When he died, nobody gave a damn, and they'll do the same thing to all of us activists.\u201d Cannon-Grant, who says she has faced threats and harassment after leading Black Lives Matter marches throughout Boston over the past year, called on the crowd to support the redistribution of funds from police; elect local politicians who will work towards racial equality; and remember Black victims who were killed by Boston Police, including Burrell Ramsey-White in 2012 and Terrence Coleman in 2016. \u201cLet me explain to you all what racism looks like in Boston,\u201d Cannon-Grant said. \u201cRacism looks like [Governor] Charlie Baker vetoing women's rights. Racism looks like not having adequate housing. Racism looks like when you pass Mass Ave, your life expectancy drops 30 percent. That's what racism looks like.\u201d On Christmas Eve, Baker vetoed a bill to expand access to abortion in Massachusetts, only to have the legislature override his veto. Cannon-Grant also criticized Gov. Baker for the final version of the state police reform bill, which she says was \u201cwatered down to nothing.\u201d The bill creates a police certification system and an independent board that can investigate allegations of police misconduct.Cannon-Grant emphasized the importance of electing not just politicians of color, but ensuring that any person in a position of power will continue the fight for equality. \"We have a mayoral election coming around and I get it, they're Black, that's great... and? What else you got?\" she said. \"Because [Kentucky Attorney General] Daniel Cameron ran his election on being the first Black person in that seat, and Breonna Taylor still does not have justice. I'm tired of people being the first Black anything and we don't see nothing Black come to the table.\" Taylor was killed by police in her Louisville, Ky. apartment last March.Organizers of Monday's rally had originally planned to march to the State House, which is currently under close police surveillance as the inauguration of President-Elect Joe Biden approaches, a day that some alt-right extremists have vowed will result in riots and violence. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of the fight for our lives, and it\u2019s going to get real dangerous in these next couple of days,\u201d Cannon-Grant said. \u201cAnybody who doesn\u2019t believe that these people are angry and that this is based off of racism is not paying attention, and we can\u2019t afford for no more Black lives to die.\u201d Cannon-Grant was joined by Sean Ellis, whose conviction for killing a police officer was overturned in 2015 after he had spent 22 years in prison,  and Darrell Jones, who served 32 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. \u201cWe\u2019re out here protesting Black Lives Matter, but there are Black lives behind bars that matter,\u201d Ellis told the crowd. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget the people who are incarcerated, being affected by COVID-19, being put in an 8 x10 cell with two or three other people \u2014 their lives matter too.\u201d Jones rejected \u201cplatitudes\u201d around MLK Day, referencing King\u2019s famous \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech. \"Let's not keep talking about Martin Luther King's dream, let's wake up and go where we are supposed to go and do something we can do,\" Jones told GBH News.  \"We have to look out for each other.\"The King holiday came less than two weeks after thousands of extremists supporting President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. That attack came as no surprise to Roxbury activist Kristen Halbert. \u201cI am a little bit gobsmacked that there are some people who actually are surprised, who look at what happened and are actually in disbelief, but that just speaks to the chasm between those of us that cannot escape the system and those who are simply watching or are adjacent to the system,\u201d Halbert said. \u201cIt seems like everyone is finally understanding things that we as a community have been shouting at the top of our lungs, not for weeks or months or years, but for decades.\u201d Halbert says she\u2019s frustrated to see people pay attention to racism on one day and then become complacent in their inaction the next. \"These social media posts and hashtags are not enough, we need to get the policy,\" she said. But she said she believes Boston can make racial progress. \u201cWe need to have the hard conversations and do the hard work. It is going to be wildly uncomfortable, but everyone is going to have to sit in that discomfort so that we can move forward.\u201d ",

Speaking with GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath, King Boston executive director Imari Paris Jeffries said the center will be dedicated to advancing social justice causes amid what he and others have referred to as a \"third Reconstruction,\" illustrated by the racial inequities of the coronavirus crisis, overt disenfranchisement efforts, myriad incidents of police brutality, and an accompanying surge in activism.\"I think we are experiencing that in Boston,\" said Jeffries, \"with the emergence of several prominent both civic and political leaders of color, and attitudes around inclusion and racial equity in Boston.\"Jeffries said the center will build on the work of grassroots organizers moved to action by a fraught national moment in which many have been forced to reckon with the past and present of American racism.  \"People feel like they're losing their country,\" said Jeffries, \"but in fact, they're not losing their country, because this is our country as well. And so they're being invited to imagine a country where folks have equal opportunity and equal access to prosperity and liberty. And so that's that's what we're asking for. That's what we're demanding in this moment in time.\"Jeffries noted that just as current activists are facing fierce blowback now, Martin Luther King Jr. and the goals he espoused were denigrated by opponents of the civil rights movement. Jeffries said that while a sanitized image of King has been embraced in the decades following his assassination, a majority of white people rejected him while he was alive.\"In the sixties, two-thirds of white people thought negatively of Dr. King. Many, many folks who were surveyed after he was murdered thought that he brought it on himself, based on his work,\" Jeffries said.Jeffries said that the country and the state have a unique chance to embrace and advance King's mission while highlighting his ties to Boston.\"Now is the time for us to activate around being in a Commonwealth where all of us are welcomed, all of us are included,\" said Jeffries. \"We have an opportunity in Massachusetts to be the first city, the first state in the country, to create this city on the hill that we all aspire for that King talked about.\"",

      "body": "Before Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced he'd been tapped for a position in the Biden administration, only two people announced they'd be willing to run against him: City Councilors Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell. Now that the stakes of running against an established incumbant have dissolved, the race is expected to open up. Campbell told Boston Public Radio on Tuesday that her strategy remains the same, regardless of who may jump in the race.\"I knew the urgency and the opportunity of the moment,\" she said of her decision to get in the race in September, shortly after fellow councilor Wu had announced her run.\"We need to confront our own painful history of racism and division,\" she said. \"But to do that, we need leadership that is bold, courageous, understands those inequities and of course has lived them. Never in a million years did I think I'd be able to take a personal and painful personal story and use it for such a time as this. So nothing has changed.\"Campbell is running on her Boston roots, and she often speaks of her twin brother, Andre, whose death in pretrial detention foundationally impacted her vision of Boston and the way government should work for its people. \"That question is fueling this work and will continue to fuel this mayoral run, with the goal of eradicating these inequties but doing it in a way that brings people together,\" Campbell said.Campbell said the city's COVID-19 response is her top priority, and that she will invest in \"resiliency and modernizing our public health infrastructure\" so that it works for everyone, noting that people of color have been hit hard by COVID-19 due to systemic health inequties and racism.\"Communities of color have been bearing the brunt of this from the very beginning,\" Campbell said. \"They have been in the red since the very beginning. I know there's been disussion about the city going back into the red. Some communties in the city of Boston have never gotten out of the red.\"She also praised the Boston Public Schools' plan to reopen classrooms by the end of March, starting with students with the highest needs and the youngest learners first.",

      "body": "The federal government routinely denies access to records that may help defendants in immigration cases, putting immigrants facing court action at a disadvantage from the start, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a lawsuit filed in Boston.The organization's Massachusetts chapter argues in the suit filed Friday that the Department of Homeland Security systematically withholds records of immigrants facing detention, deportation and other actions.The agency's nondisclosure policy violates federal law and forces immigration lawyers to defend their clients with incomplete information, the ACLU said.The organization also argued the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated the problem in Boston. It said a court order currently prevents immigrants and attorneys who appear by teleconference from examining any documents or evidence introduced by DHS in court.The ACLU argues that oftentimes the records sought are not confidential and could bolster a defendant\u2019s case, yet DHS requires defendants to file Freedom of Information Act requests.Such public records requests take so long that the immigrants can be deported long before the information is provided, the organization said.Spokespersons for DHS didn't respond to a message seeking comment Tuesday.

      "body": "It\u2019s easy to feel envious when you see Gov. Charlie Baker\u2019s Swampscott home. It\u2019s a beautiful house, in a gorgeous neighborhood, located right by a stunning stretch of shoreline. On dozens of occasions over the past year, though, Baker\u2019s home has become a target for political protest \u2014 and the scene there has been anything but idyllic.  In 2020, a Boston anti-addiction activist got hit with a restraining order after dumping used needles on the sidewalk by the governor\u2019s house. A protest by the group Jews Against Fascism led to multiple arrests. And a Danvers man was arrested and charged after walking right inside. Then there are the regular, ongoing visits from Dianna Ploss, a rabid supporter of President Donald Trump who refers to Black Lives Matter as \u201cBurn Loot Murder\u201d and diversity as \u201cdiver-shitty.\u201d Since last spring, Ploss and her allies have been railing against COVID-19 restrictions, airing other hard-right grievances and clashing with counter protestors. Those gatherings are a recurring political migraine for Baker and his neighbors, but they\u2019re also taking a toll on Swampscott as a whole.Town Administrator Sean Fitzgerald cites traffic woes, significant police overtime costs and the sheer toxicity of the pro-Trump protests, which take place right next to an elementary school. \u201cThe vitriol is just so offensive,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cSeeing a confederate flag right on our Civil War monument really should cause everyone to pause and think, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201dBut Fitzgerald also says that given the First Amendment, the town doesn\u2019t have many options when it comes to containing the protests. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in constant conversation with Town Counsel, looking at, what are our legal remedies.\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have the ability to prevent speech \u2026 nor do I think any of us would want to.\u201d That lack of recourse is especially dismaying to Tamy-Fe\u00e9 Meneide, one of just a few Swampscott residents of color and the facilitator of an ongoing conversation about racism in the town.Meneide has been targeted by Ploss, who\u2019s told her supporters that Meneide is actually working for the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cShe has mentioned me by name \u2026 called me out in terms of wondering why I moved from Roxbury to Swampscott,\u201d Meneide said. \u201cI thought to myself, maybe this will pass. But it didn\u2019t.\u201dAs a result, Meneide says, the simple act of leaving her home has become harrowing. \u201cIt\u2019s a little scary going out, particularly with my son,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a very recognizable person \u2014 I have blue locks, and I\u2019m a black female. I\u2019m a unicorn, if you will, in Swampscott right now.\u201dWhat\u2019s happening at Baker\u2019s house isn\u2019t unique. In recent months, politicians from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu have seen their homes become political targets. When Sununu moved his inauguration indoors, he cited the presence of armed men outside his house.It\u2019s an ominous trend, made even more foreboding by some Trump supporters\u2019 embrace of political violence.Still, Fitzgerald, the town administrator, is striking a guardedly upbeat note as he looks ahead to 2021. \u201cSometimes, it takes conflict to open up a perspective that\u2019s actually better,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish we could have avoided a lot of it. But there may be a silver lining in the fact that we\u2019ve got a clear and present challenge, and I think we\u2019ll rise to it.\u201dFor her part, Meneide says she she hopes Ploss\u2019s protests \u2014 and the participation of some locals \u2014 will help advance Swampscott\u2019s ongoing reckoning with race and racism.\u201cI think what it has allowed folks to reckon with is that there is some common ground in the overall bare minimum of feeling safe \u2014 feeling safe in your home, feeling safe in your town, feeling safe at the grocery store,\u201d Meneide said. \u201cPeople understand what it feels like to feel ... living in terror and what it feels like to be safe. So in that way, it has sort of made those conversations a little bit easier to have.\u201d",

Jon Santiago, who is also an emergency room physician at Boston Medical Center, spoke to Boston Public Radio on Tuesday about what the arrival of the variant means for residents.\"Although there was a glimmer of hope from the vaccination coming, I think we're in for a rough three or four months,\" he said. \"This variant is upwards of 50 percent more transmissible, but the good thing is that in terms of how lethal it is, there doesn't seem to be a difference,\" he said.Santiago predicts that we'll see more cases due to the extra contagious variant.\"It's predicted that by March this will be the dominant strain in Massachusetts and across the country,\" he said. \"So we are literally in a race against the variant and how quickly we can vaccinate people.\"",

      "body": "As the days ticked down towards the Isobel Cup Final last March, the Boston Pride seemed poised to add another chalice to its trophy collection. With a 23-1 record, a National Women\u2019s Hockey League championship felt more like an inevitability than a goal.The only thing that could stop the team, it turns out, was the coronavirus. The NWHL postponed the final between Boston and the Minnesota Whitecaps a day before the championship game was scheduled to take place in March as the sports world began to wise up to the viral threat.Pride forward and captain Jillian Dempsey remembers the emotional elevator, when excitement about the game plunged to shock and disappointment. \u201cAs everything settled, it was starting to become more frustrating,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, \u2018Aw man, we never got that chance!\u2019\u201dThe NWHL eventually canceled the match as the pandemic continued to spread, leaving the season finale on a cliffhanger the league never resolved.Now, more than 10 months since the team\u2019s last game, the Pride are preparing to return to the ice as the entire NWHL packs its bags for a two-week bubble season at the 1980 Rink-Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, New York. Games begin Jan. 23.Bubbles have become common as pro leagues navigate COVID-19. For Pride President Hayley Moore and the rest of the NWHL, the challenge of setting up the protective shell has been worthy of its own trophy. \u201cWe want to be sure that the safety of our players, our staff, our fans, our communities are the top priority,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as things evolved, this was really just the natural fit to be able to salvage a season.\u201dThe league started working on return-to-play options back in April. The plan has shifted and changed several times as the NWHL saw what other leagues got right and wrong and as the world has continued to live with the pandemic. The league has worked with the New York State Olympic Regional Development Authority to put up the bubble. COVID testing will be provided by Yale Pathology Labs. The plan is for each of the NWHL\u2019s six teams to play one game against each other. That will be followed by playoffs and the Isobel Cup Final. Still, Pride Head Coach Paul Mara points out that what the NWHL will do is an entirely different animal from other leagues like the NHL, which had bubbles in two Canadian cities at the start of its return over the summer. Mara\u2019s squad will be in a hotel in the frosty confines of upstate New York in late January, where he\u2019s expecting subzero temperatures. \u201cEveryone understands that we\u2019re up there to play hockey,\u201d he said, refering to the site of the 1980 Winter Olympics. \u201cWe\u2019re not up there on vacation. We\u2019re not up there to relish in everything in the history of Lake Placid. We\u2019re up there to win an Isobel Cup. And, you know, I think that\u2019s been our focus since this has been announced in November that we have a lot of games in a short amount of time. And our focus is to win.\u201dThe team has been practicing for this moment since September and has used that time to acclimate themselves to the protocols for the return to play. Pride rookie forward Sammy Davis, the first overall pick in the 2020 draft, has gone through what seems like an endless preseason. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for everybody, not just the rookies. It\u2019s been a hard year. There\u2019s been a lot of emotions. It\u2019s been frustrating to show up to the rink some days, not show up to the rink some days, not be able to come to the rink some days,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hardest part is the unknown.\u201dStill, Davis has found comfort in being on the ice and in a locker room. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to play hockey and finally put on my jersey for the first time and play in an actual game,\u201d she said. When Davis and the Pride reach Lake Placid, it will be to win hockey games. But the players, who are often studying or working other jobs, will also have to carry on with their lives. Davis will continue work on her doctorate degree in occupational therapy while she\u2019s in the bubble. Jillian Dempsey teaches fifth grade in her hometown of Winthrop. She taught remotely all fall and just started hybrid classes at the beginning of this month. In Lake Placid, she\u2019ll be teaching on Zoom from her hotel room during the day and skating out on the ice at night. It\u2019ll be a grind.\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a number of games in 13 days. When we were little, we used to play six in a weekend at tournaments. It\u2019s gonna be close to that feeling again,\" she said. \"But obviously these games are gonna be more taxing and more demanding than when were playing youth hockey. It\u2019s pretty much gonna be a game every day or every other day. That\u2019s a tremendous amount of hockey.\u201dDempsey\u2019s been playing organized hockey since she was five and said this period has probably been the longest she\u2019s gone without playing a real game since then.But with games back on the calendar, the Pride have a chance to feel something like normal again, if just for two weeks in the bubble (which has been christened #Ndubble on Twitter). When the league hosts the Isobel Cup Final on Feb. 5, which will be broadcast to a national audience, maybe they can claim a crown that never found a head to rest on last March.",

Now, those moments have been eliminated to stem the spread of the virus.\"You're used to that camaraderie, that collegiality, of just being able to eat with your colleague and kind of share experiences, so having to move to this type of environment has been challenging,\" said Algeri. \"It's very different for staff, and the ways that we would normally interact and cope during stressful times has been adapted and is just very different. So you used to go into your break room and maybe talk about how your day is going, and now that experience is different because we have to make sure that we're keeping staff safe here.\"Algeri was joined by registered nurse Brittany Sheehan, also from MGH, who's been caring for COVID patients in intensive care since the spring.Then, with president-elect Joe Biden set to be inaugurated tomorrow, we checked back in with Boston resident Eleanor Kaplan, who recently turned 100. In the spring, Kaplan said she wanted to live through the pandemic to see Biden be elected.Click on the audio player above to listen to the full episode.Segments:Suzanne Algeri & Brittany Sheehan - 2:56Eleanor Kaplan - 18:02",

Phase 2 is expected to begin next month and will include seniors and people with two risk factors, called comorbidities. The general public is expected to start getting vaccinated in Phase 3 in April. And as the state prepares, challenges abound, including determining appropriate locations for vaccination clinics and finding people to administer the vaccine.The first challenge is to make sure there\u2019s enough vaccine \u2014 knowing how much is coming and when. Gov. Charlie Baker said this has been a complication of the phase 1 rollout.\u201cFrankly, at this point, we're typically hearing when the next dose is coming a couple of days before it lands,\u201d Baker said at a recent press briefing.Not knowing when the vaccine will arrive makes it hard for vaccination sites to book appointments ahead. Dr. Paul Biddinger, chair of the state\u2019s vaccine advisory group, told GBH News he\u2019s hoping for a more predictable supply in the coming weeks.\u201cBut right now, it's just one of so many unknowns that has made this rollout, this planning so very hard,\u201d he said. Biddinger said another complication of the effort is finding space for vaccinating a large number of people. \u201cThere's a required 15-minute observation period after people get vaccinated, which creates a huge space need,\" he said. \"So that after you've been vaccinated, we have to create a large number of chairs, six feet apart for people to be observed before they can move on.\"The state is looking for large venues with plenty of space \u2014 Baker announced Tuesday that Fenway Park will become Massachusetts\u2019 second mass vaccination site for the first phase after Gillette Stadium, which is already home to a site. Biddinger said they\u2019re also considering big drive-through sites, and the state has also begun distributing the vaccine to independent physicians' practices.  CVS and Walgreens are also receiving doses beginning this week. A CVS spokesperson told GBH News that any in-store vaccinations will require an appointment.Boston\u2019s chief of health and human services, Marty Martinez, said finding appropriate vaccination venues is just one of many challenges the city is still working out.\u201cHow do you ensure you\u2019re following the prioritization that\u2019s been laid out so those most vulnerable get vaccinated first?\u201d he asked. \u201cMaking sure that in diverse communities, these clinics are accessible, in neighborhoods where people may have hesitancy to get vaccinated? So the city\u2019s working through all of that.\u201dCommunity health centers are also expected to play a major role in vaccine distribution. \u201cIf there's a trusted voice in communities that can get past this vaccination hesitancy, it\u2019s community health centers,\u201d said Michael Curry, president and CEO of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers.Lines are already wrapping around the block at many community health centers for COVID-19 testing. Curry said they\u2019re now trying to find the resources to support the vaccination effort, and he\u2019s hoping Congress will step in to help provide it. \u201cImagine in a system that's already overwhelmed, with a workforce that's already overwhelmed, with workforce shortages that existed well before this pandemic, that we're adding on top of that a massive vaccination effort,\u201d Curry said.Another challenge is finding enough people to administer the vaccine. \u201cI don't know that there's a shortage of people that are qualified to do it,\u201d said Dan Hoffenberg, vice president of Cataldo Ambulance Service, which has been recruiting people for the job. \u201cI think there is a shortage of people being asked to do it.\u201d Hoffenberg said they\u2019ve gotten about 1,500 applications and will start in-person training this week. There are also hundreds of medical volunteers signing up to help their local communities host vaccination sites. Health departments in many small towns don't have the capacity to host their own vaccination clinics, but Dr. Marcia Testa, president of the Massachusetts Association of Health Boards, said many plan to partner with neighboring communities. \u201cI think people don't realize how much training health departments have been going through every month, having meetings with their public health preparedness trainers and managers,\u201d Testa said. \u201cAnd so now it's actually putting into practice what you've been drilling on for almost 15 years.\u201dVaccinating an entire state is a huge endeavor. But Testa said she\u2019s optimistic it\u2019s going to wind up being a lot more coordinated than most might expect. ",

Vernon K. Walker encouraged the crowd of 75 people to continue fighting against racial inequality. \u201cYes, we voted out a fascist from office in Trump. And while the darkness has seemed to recede, we still have to grapple with white supremacy,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThere are too many Black and brown bodies who have been shot down and murdered by the police, who have been discarded and treated like less than human. We need to continue to band together to fight against those systems of oppression and injustice.\u201d rev.jpgThe initial rally, organized by the Boston May Day Coalition and several other left-leaning groups, was met by another crowd of protesters marching from Government Center. \u201cToday is not a day for celebration,\u201d Roxbury activist Ernst Jean-Jacques said. \u201cWe should all take a moment to rejoice that the monster known as Donald Trump has finally been de-platformed and removed from power. But the work is only now beginning. Joe Biden is not anyone's savior, and we cannot expect an immediate change \u2026 so as Joe Biden will fight to uphold the status quo, we have no other option than resisting.\u201d No matter who occupies the White House, activists will still have to work to fight the deportation of immigrants and the wrongful imprisonment of people of color in Massachusetts, said Antuan Castro Del Rio, a regular fixture at Black Lives Matter protests around the state. \u201cWe have two people who got elected who are not as bad as the last guy,\" Castro Del Rio said. \"hey were the lesser of two evils. But we are tired of evil. We need to get something good.\u201d antuan.jpgAs the sun set on the park, the combined crowds totaling 150 protesters marched down Newbury Street chanting, waving Black Lives Matter flags and holding signs reading \u201cno honeymoon for Biden.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is going to be in the White House if the problems continue here,\u201d Arlington resident Sebatian Felipe said. \u201cRacism, worker\u2019s issues, social problems \u2026 that\u2019s why this is no honeymoon for Joe Biden. He needs to know what kinds of things he needs to deal with in the next four years.\u201dTweetDespite increased security surrounding the State House and a flock of some 75 officers bicycling around the area, Boston police barely interacted with the crowd as it marched through Back Bay and finally landed on the steps of the Boston Public Library. There, activists stated their demands, including the release of all ICE detainees during the pandemic, specific COVID-19 resources and relief for Indigenous communities, a statewide eviction moratorium, rent relief and the legalization of driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented immigrants. Protesters also called for the release of all people who have been incarcerated for protest-related charges and for protesters to be reimbursed for any bail funds they have already paid. rally 2.jpgWillow Reader, an activist with Boston Socialist Alternative, listed national demands: better vaccine distribution, more individual payments for COVID-19 relief and the redistribution of funding from police departments into community-led initiatives.Reader said that those policies seem unlikely under a Biden administration, but they planned to keep pushing for them.\"the biggest concessions that we've won historically, like Social Security and the New Deal, weren't just handed to us,\" Reader said. \"They were the result of mass movements, of everyday people taking to the streets and demanding.\u201d",

      "body": "President Joe Biden\u2019s first round of immigration-related executive orders has drawn praise and hope for further reform from immigration advocates in Massachusetts and across the country.The orders, signed just hours after Biden was sworn in as the nation\u2019s 46th president, began what is expected to be a long process of chiseling away at the anti-immigrant policies that were a centerpiece of the Trump administration.\u201cI\u2019m really pleased to hear the commitments that he\u2019s made in these initial executive actions and, hopefully, the continued action that he and his administration will take toward immigration justice,\u201d the Rev. Cody Sanders of Old Cambridge Baptist Church said. Sanders' church has offered sanctuary to undocumented immigrants since the 1980s and is now part of a coalition of ten Cambridge-based churches that shares the responsibilities associated with hosting immigrants in sanctuary.Biden\u2019s actions included fortifying the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy established under the Obama administration in 2012. It gives the Department of Homeland Security authority to exercise discretion when it comes to deporting immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and have \u201cobeyed the law and stayed in school or enlisted in the military,\u201d according to the Wednesday order. Former President Donald Trump attempted to terminate DACA, but the U.S. Supreme Court concluded last June that it was done in an unlawful manner. The administration was eventually ordered to re-open deferral applications.Biden also reinstated deportation deferrals for Liberians who fled to the U.S. from civil conflict in their country in the early 1990s, revoked a 2017 expansion of immigration enforcement and reversed the so-called \u201cMuslim ban\u201d that had prevented people from certain countries from entering the U.S.Sanders, who traveled to Logan Airport the night the so-called Muslim ban went into effect, described the last four years as a period of \u201ccontinual crisis response\u201d and said the travel ban reversal and the revocation of immigration enforcement expansion would likely be most consequential to the community his church serves. \"There are so many ways that we have seen the lives of immigrants in our community become really precarious because of the actions of the previous administration, so I think there's a lot of potential in those actions to make life more livable,\" he said.Other advocates agreed on the need for more work.Krish O\u2019Mara Vignarajah, who heads the Baltimore-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said the actions also signal a return to an America that is open and compassionate towards immigrants. Her organization has resettled more than 500 refugees in Massachusetts since 2016, according to a spokesperson. \u201cWe are deeply grateful to the Biden administration for keeping its word to refugees, asylum seekers [and] all those who stand for America as a welcoming nation,\u201d Vignaraja told GBH News. \u201cIt is incredible to see the stark contrast that the Biden administration represents, even down to the fact that the new vice president is the daughter of immigrants from opposite sides of the globe,\u201d she added.Eva Millona, president of Massachusetts Immigration and Refugee Coalition, or MIRA, said that while the executive orders are heartening, they are not the ultimate answer to the problem of the outdated U.S. immigration system. \"We're eager to see the temporary fixes to end the suffering and the level of anxiety and the powerful fears among the immigrant community and mixed-status household families, but we would love to see legislative fixes,\" she said.Millona pointed to a recent Fox News poll that found most Americans support legal status for undocumented immigrants. A 2017 Fox News poll also found that found 83% of respondents \u2014 including 63% of Trump voters \u2014 supported a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.\u201cIt\u2019s not just one issue that affects the immigrant community \u2014 [it] impacts all of us. That\u2019s why over 180 corporations just the other day signed on to a letter to Congress,\u201d Millona said, pointing to a Wednesday letter from the technology trade group TechNet that urged Congress to approve the Biden administration\u2019s immigration agenda.\u201cI think it will help that the immigration debate will [now be] a policy issue, not a political issue,\" Millona said.Other immigration-focused groups expressed concern over what the executive orders and coming policy proposals might mean for the country. The DC-based Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for limited and controlled immigration, released a statement labelling Biden\u2019s executive actions as \u201cantithetical\u201d to the goal of unifying our nation.\u201cWe hope fervently that when it comes to dealing with immigration, the new administration will seek to find common-sense policies that not only serve to enhance the economic recovery from COVID, but provide lasting security and prosperity for the country,\" said Dan Stein, FAIR's president. \"President Biden must protect American jobs and not capitulate to special interests pushing radical policies that put Americans last.\"Stein added that the group looks forward to engaging with the administration in the future.Sanders said others should prepare to engage, too, explaining that despite the relief many might feel from the executive actions, they should commit to keeping the administration and all elected officials accountable.\u201cWe are a country of great aspirations, many of which have never really been lived up to or lived in to,\" he said. \"So, ensuring that the energy \u2026 [that is] really keeping our elect officials accountable to those aspirations is what I\u2019m focused on going forward.\"",

Charlie Baker will lift the current 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew and stay-at-home advisory. Baker said Thursday that positive COVID-19 test rates and hospitalization rates are going down enough to relieve some of the restrictions on movement and businesses.\"We all know that we are not out of the woods yet by any means, but things do appear to be getting a bit better here in Massachusetts,\" Baker said.The rate of COVID-19 cases that result in hospitalization is down 10% since the peak of the second surge in January, Baker said. Likewise, the average positive test rate is down 33% since the beginning of January, and the seven-day average is down around 30% since the January peak. \"Vaccines are reaching residents, positive case rates and hospitalizations have stabilized. Those trends are moving in the right direction. As a result, we believe it's OK, and it's time to start a gradual easing of some of the restrictions we put in place in the fall,\" Baker said.Capacity limits for most businesses open to the public will remain at 25% for an additional two weeks, ending Feb. 8.Earlier in the day, Baker laid much of the blame for Massachusetts' COVID-19 vaccine woes on the slow trickle of supply coming from the federal government, amid criticism that the vaccines aren't being distributed widely enough in the state.\"The big thing is, we need more supply coming into the commonwealth, coming into all states,\" Baker said.Baker said that in order to move the state's vaccination plan forward, the federal government and President Joe Biden's new administration need to make more supply available \u2014 either by enhancing manufacturing of the two vaccines that already have FDA authorization or by authorizing new vaccines for distribution.\"I want to give the Biden administration a couple of days here to get their feet on the ground, because I don't think there was the kind of connectivity that probably should have been there to get from the administration to the next on something that is as critically important as this is,\" Baker said.Baker was at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, the state's first and currently only mass vaccination site, on Thursday to announce that home health care workers and medical staff not directly involved in COVID-19 care are now eligible for vaccination appointments. A second mass vaccination site will open at Fenway Park in Boston on Feb. 1, and Baker said more vaccinations infrastructure will come online over the next ten to 14 days.\"We'll continue to roll out additional capacity, but the speed with which we roll out the capacity is driven to some extent by what we believe the scenario is going to be with respect to how much additional vaccine we get from the feds,\" Baker said.Baker also announced another 638 grants awarded to small businesses totalling $37.4 million in relief for companies harmed by the pandemic shutdowns.",

      "body": "Boston city councilor and mayoral candidate Andrea Campbell is proposing a multipronged plan to improve conditions in the area around the intersection of Melnea Cass Boulevard and Massachusetts Avenue, a gathering ground for people struggling with homelessness, mental illness and addiction that is known as \"Mass & Cass.\"The proposal calls for appointing a dedicated official to oversee a coordinated response to the area and creating a first responder unit. Campbell's plan also calls for reactivating the city\u2019s now abandoned shelter on Long Island \u2014 once the area's largest \u2014 with ferry service.This patch in the South End is where Campbell grew up. \u201cThis is my area, and it never looked like this, even in the days and years it was hard. There weren\u2019t needles in my park, there weren\u2019t people laying on the street near my bus stop when I got on the bus to go to school,\u201d said Campbell lamenting the state of the neighborhood during a press conference Friday.Campbell declined to take a position on safe injection sites, facilities where drug users are supervised while injecting, but said having a dedicated public health official would open up opportunities for nuanced discussions about all solutions.\u201cI think that\u2019s a conversation we need to have with more residents,\u201d she said, pointing to the controversial nature of supervised injection sites. \u201cBut I do think having a Mass & Cass chief own this and being engaging with stakeholders\u2026is critically important.\u201dCampbell rejected the notion that appointing a Mass & Cass chief to lead the city\u2019s response would equate to fruitless bureaucracy.\u201cOne big distinction is it needs to be someone who as an actual background and proven track record and experience as a public health professional,\u201d she said, responding to a reporter question. \u201cI think the current [health and human services] chief, the task force [and] city employees are working really hard. I think they\u2019re overwhelmed and need someone who has a proven track record in this regard.\u201dIn a Friday morning policy release, Campbell\u2019s campaign described the situation in and around Mass & Cass as \"a public health tragedy.\"\u201cTackling this head-on is one of Boston\u2019s greatest challenges \u2014 it is untenable for the people who spend time there, the residents living and working there and businesses in the area,\u201d the plan said, citing the 900 opioid-related overdose deaths within the city between 2015 and 2019.The area, sometimes referred to as \u201cMethadone Mile,\u201d became a problem after the 450-bed shelter on Long Island closed in 2014.Since then, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and his Quincy counterpart, Thomas P. Koch, have publicly feuded over the future of bridge, with Koch recently vowing to appeal a Superior Court ruling that nullified a Quincy commission\u2019s decision denying Boston\u2019s application to rebuild the bridge.Campbell plans to circumvent the legal battles by using ferries to transport clients to and from Long Island..\u201cOpponents dismiss ferries due to concerns about weather and emergencies,\" Campbell's plan said. \"But comparable New England cities run ferries year-round, operate on-site infirmaries and use helicopters for medical emergencies in remote locations \u2014 Boston can deploy similar best practices.\u201dCampbell called for economic and feasibility studies.Campbell\u2019s plan would create more shelter and supportive housing utilizing hotels and vacant spaces.It would also increase the number of treatment locations to help relieve congestion in the area, in part by distributing syringe exchange and overdose prevention sites around the city.\u201cDecentralizing services is not only about equity, it is also necessary for effective recovery: Individuals at various points in the recovery process find it unspeakably hard to get sober when widespread use areas are right next to recovery sites,\u201d Campbell's proposal said.Campbell said she is optimistic about proposing more treatment and support sites around the city. The councilor said she's talked with advocates who emphasize the need for equitable, city-wide distribution of services.\u201cThis is a crisis,\" said Campbell, \"that is not just affecting Mass & Cass, it\u2019s affecting our entire city, out entire commonwealth and the country and so we have to do our part as a city as a whole to respond. It can\u2019t be one neighborhood that steps up.\u201d Prior to her press conference, Campbell toured the area with residents who walked her through parks and along streets strewn with needles, and once-sterile sterile cooking ups, used to prepare heroin for injection. Domingos DaRosa, a community activist who was served a \u201cstay away\u201d order after dumping needles at Governor Charlie Baker\u2019s house in Swampscott, struck a cautiously optimistic note about Campbell\u2019s plan for the area, where he also grew up.\u201cAll plans are worth trying at this moment,\u201d he said with an exasperated sigh. \u201cWe as a community need to be held accountable, once we establish that, then we can hold people in positions [of power] accountable.\"Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu \u2014 who is, so far, the only other declared mayoral candidate \u2014 has also called for decentralization of treatment services, along with monitoring mechanism that rely less on law enforcement.Since the fall of 2019, the Walsh administration has been working on the problem with a strategic plan and a 25-member Mass & Cass Task Force.Janina Rackard, 47, who lives in the South End and pulled her daughter out of school at Orchard Gardens partly because of the needle problem, said Campbell's plan got her attention.\u201cAt the beginning, I didn\u2019t know who she was\u2026I don\u2019t think anyone else, other than Michelle Wu has showed this interest,\u201d she explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Andrea. I know Andrea now.\u201d  ",

      "body": "Despite COVID-19 case numbers reaching well into the thousands each day, the post-holiday season surge was not as bad as many expected, according to a new study from Northeastern, Harvard, Northwestern and Rutgers Universities. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern University political science and computer science professor David Lazer about the numbers and his outlook for 2021. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: So what exactly happened over the holidays? Some people say it could have been worse and that the wave has crested; others say because of gathering over the holidays and the trends here with COVID \u2014  the new strain \u2014 that we are entering a dark winter that will see much worse conditions. David Lazer: I think there's some truth to all of the above. I think that, to some extent, people did heed the calls to not gather for the holidays. We found in our survey 70 percent of people said that they essentially spent the holidays alone or just with people in their households. In Massachusetts, it was actually a little better still; around 75 percent said that they didn't gather with people from other households during the holiday. That's the good news, and we also have more good news, which is that people in the country have tightened up their social distancing behaviors since earlier in the fall and they are also wearing masks more. So that's all good news, and I think as a result of some of that, the fall and early winter wave was not as bad as it could be. However, there is bad news, which is that we have these new variants coming, and we do have a very hard few months ahead of us. Mathieu: Before I ask you more about that, what do we know about demographics or any trends? Are there trends in those who chose to be responsible and those who chose to gather? Were there political lines drawn? Lazer: Yes, unfortunately, we've seen a politicization of health behaviors really from early on. One of the biggest predictors of gathering for the holidays, as well as social distancing behaviors and mask wearing, has been partisanship. So Democrats wear masks more, they got together for the holidays less [and] they're social distancing more than Republicans. That's part of the reason why Massachusetts has done pretty well in all of these metrics is because it's a more democratic state. There are some other differences. For example, there are racial differences. So African-Americans and Hispanics are social distancing more and got together less for the holidays than white respondents. And there are big age differences. Younger people are behaving in a more risky fashion, perhaps because the age gradient of the risk of a disease. We put young people [at] a lot less risk than older people in terms of if they get sick. Mathieu: There are crosscurrents. This new variant is a big deal, right, professor? Not in its level of deadliness or severity, but just spread. When we hear about Governor Baker rolling back some restrictions, does the timing worry you here? Lazer: Absolutely. And what we know about the new variant, when we look at where it's become dominant in countries like the U.K. and Ireland, is that once it gets rolling, it just explodes. And so we know it's here, right? It's just that if it's starting from one case and then two cases and four cases and eight cases, it's still a rounding error. At this moment, we don't know exactly how common it is yet because, unfortunately, the U.S. has done a pretty lousy job of genomic surveillance, but at some point it goes from being at a very low level and it goes very quickly from being a low level to being a very high level. So it's very likely that sometime in the next six weeks or so, we're going to hit that crux in the elbow \u2014  the exponential curve \u2014  where it's just going to start going straight up and we're going to have to tighten restrictions up quite a lot then. Mathieu: And that's February \u2014 about a month from now, you said? Lazer: There's a lot of variation, so I wouldn't want to say, \"well, it's going to be February 23,\" but the experts that I've listened to and talked to would suggest sometime in the next six weeks. We just can't really say is it going to be two weeks from now or six weeks from now, but that's a reasonable time range where we might expect it to start really exploding. Mathieu: So what gives you hope here? Is it a mask mandate, as President Biden has begun to introduce, at least, in terms of airplanes, federal property and so forth, or are you holding out for maybe another vaccine \u2014  let's say J&J [Johnson & Johnson] shows up \u2014  or just more doses available so we can make more people eligible? Lazer: Well, there are a few things that give me hope. We have a race now between vaccination and this new variant, and in the short run, the new variant of the coronavirus is going to win because we just can't go fast enough. However, as we vaccinate the highest risk populations, we will see death rates start to drop. So we have a hard few months ahead, but then we're going to hit a point where enough people will be vaccinated and other people will have gotten immune the hard way because they've been infected. Plus, there's clearly a seasonal element to the transmissibility. So as we move into the spring, we'll have the wind at our backs. Right now we're going into the wind and then once we get over this hump, we'll have the wind at our backs combined with higher levels of vaccination. So everything I see still leaves me a lot of hope that the spring will be a lot brighter than the winter. The winter is going to be dark, though.",

The 66-year-old marathoner is now running against the clock in the fight to end the coronavirus pandemic.McGillivray owns DMSE Sports, an event management company, and he has been tapped to be the overall operations manager for the state's mass vaccination sites at Gillette Stadium and Fenway Park. DMSE Sports is working with the Baker administration, CIC Health, The New England Patriots, The Boston Red Sox, Fallon Ambulance, Mass General Brigham and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to make the mass vaccination sites a reality. After a soft rollout, Gillette opened its vaccine distribution center on Jan. 18. Fenway Park is scheduled to open its vaccination site on Feb. 1.McGillivray said his company's new role is its greatest mission ever. The immediate plan at Fenway is to administer 500 vaccinations a day in the first week and eventually ramp up to 1,000 vaccines a day. Gillette Stadium is hoping to administer up to 5,000 daily doses of the vaccine and more as the number of eligible vaccine recipients grows, according to the Baker administration's 3-phase vaccine distribution timeline.McGillivray said his company will manage the floor of both sites. The vaccination site at Gillette is in the Putnam Club, a 40,000 square foot space at the stadium. At Fenway Park, they'll be set up on the ballpark's open concourse.\"We conceptualize the site first and decide where things should go and the timeline of it all so we can be as efficient as possible,\" McGillivray said, adding, \"our skill set is transferable. In other words, lining people up at the start of the Boston Marathon is no different than lining people up at the front door of Gillette Stadium and Fenway Park.\"McGillivray said his goal is to make the experience a positive one \u2014 he knows the prospect of getting a vaccine can be intimidating, and he hopes the opportunity to do so at an iconic ball park or football stadium will put the public more at-ease. And the job is not just helping others, he said, it's also saving his business. After months of just trying to ensure DMSE Sports survives the pandemic, he's suddenly busier than ever. \"It just did a quick 180-degree turn. It's now almost 24/7. It's nonstop,\" he said. \"While we are part of a team working to save lives, we are also grateful to be doing this, as it's helping to save us, too, as an ongoing business.\" ",

      "body": "The fiscal year 2022 state budget that Gov. Charlie Baker will file next week will fully fund, for the first time, a major school finance reform law passed in late 2019 to steer $1.5 billion to K-12 schools over seven years, he said Friday.During his annual address to the Massachusetts Municipal Association on Friday, Baker did not say how much money full funding for the Student Opportunity Act represents, but estimates for the annual cost of the law have ranged from about $300 million to $430 million.\"We're pleased to continue making these important investments in our schools and our communities,\" Baker said. \"Over the past six years we've worked closely with the Legislature to triple the size of our rainy day fund by carefully managing the state's finances, and that's enabled us to make these important investments to and with the people of Massachusetts without raising taxes in the midst of a pandemic.\"Last year, before the pandemic hit, Baker proposed a budget that would have increased Chapter 70 aid for local schools by $303.5 million. The Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, however, argued that Baker was increasing low-income student support at a slower rate than other categories of aid and Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz, who filed one of the bills on which the Student Opportunity Act was based, said Baker's pre-pandemic proposal did not fully fund \"both the letter and spirit of the Student Opportunity Act.\"The Student Opportunity Act was supposed to be implemented starting this fiscal year, but weeks of business shutdowns, skyrocketing unemployment and widespread uncertainty this spring had budget managers expecting a big drop in revenue collections. The Baker administration in late July announced that local and school aid would be held at last years level's for fiscal 2021, plus federal dollars made available to help schools reopen and an additional $107 million in school aid to cover inflation and enrollment factors.The Student Opportunity Act did not create a revenue source for the new funding and left it up to the Legislature to find and include the money in each year's budget.Baker is expected to file the budget bill on Wednesday and could offer additional insights into what he will propose when he gives his annual State of the Commonwealth address Tuesday night.On Thursday, Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito told the MMA that the budget Baker files next week will recommend increasing the state's general local aid account by $39.5 million to $1.168 billion, which works out to an increase of $112,535, on average, for all 351 municipalities.The announcement was in keeping with the Baker administration's past practice to align growth of city and town non-school aid with estimated increases in tax revenue for the coming year. Last week, the administration and Legislature agreed to build fiscal 2022 spending plans on the assumption that state tax revenues will grow by 3.5 percent to an estimated $30.12 billion.Baker said Friday that his administration has already released $1.36 billion in Chapter 90 funding since taking office and committed to filing a proposal next week for another $200 million in local road and bridge money.The governor said the $200 million Chapter 90 legislation is \"what I would think of as almost a perennial at this point.\" Baker has routinely filed for $200 million in Chapter 90 funding each year, though some in the Legislature have expressed a desire to increase the annual road funding amount to $300 million -- a step municipalities have long implored Beacon Hill to take and one the House and Senate were poised to take this year before scaling back due to the pandemic.",

      "body": "It's the first Monday since the first phase of cuts negotiated over the summer took effect at the MBTA, as COVID-19 pulled ridership to historic lows. Almost all weekend commuter rail service is now suspended, ferry service has been reduced significantly, and additional cuts to subways and busses are in the works. Governor Charlie Baker says that, as a general rule, running empty trains and busses is bad public policy \u2014 a line of thinking that The New York Times editorial board called \"small minded and shortsighted\" over the weekend. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with Chris Dempsey, Director of the Transportation for Massachusetts Advocacy Coalition. The transcript below has been edited for clarity.Joe Mathieu: So was this about riders or money? And I ask you that because the T has gotten some help in the pandemic. The federal government giving over a billion dollars [for] the next 12 months to keep service running. But we see the cuts regardless. And of course, as I mentioned, our governor says there's no point in running empty trains. What's behind all this? Chris Dempsey: The Baker administration's decisions here are very unfortunate and disappointing. You know, we agree with the governor that we shouldn't be running empty trains and busses. No one is advocating for that. But the reality is that there is still ridership on the MBTA every single day. Hundreds of thousands of people taking the bus, taking the subway, commuter rail and ferry who are making essential trips. They are essential workers. There are folks that are getting to the grocery store, to health care appointments, to school. They're not out there joyriding. They're doing it because they have to be there. And in many cases, they're the very folks that are keeping us safe, keeping us healthy, getting us vaccines. We need the service to be there for those people. We spent the last 10 or 11 months calling those folks our health care heroes, and now we're pulling the rug out from under them as they're just trying to get to work. Watch: What is the biggest worry right now about the cuts? Raw HtmlMathieu: Or they're going to return to their cars, which is a whole other conversation. But Chris Dempsey, The New York Times op-ed that I mentioned says service cuts are also self-perpetuating. Is that the conversation that we should be having? Obviously, there are issues right now, but you're worried about whether they're ever going to come back? Dempsey: Yeah, I think we're really worried about both. And Joe, you talked about congestion. It's actually not a whole separate conversation, right? It's exactly the same conversation because every day people get up and they decide whether they're going to take transit or whether they're going to drive. They make decisions about where to live based on is there good transit access or are they going to be driving instead? And if we fundamentally say that transit in greater Boston should be smaller and less robust, less reliable than it was before the pandemic, we are fundamentally changing the character of greater Boston and really the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The New York Times in that editorial \u2014 which is a lengthy one and I encourage your readers to check it out \u2014 talks about how transit really underwrites society, whether that's access to health care, whether it's things like density, you know, downtown areas like downtown Boston or Kendall Square or the Longwood medical area, they fundamentally do not work. If our transit system doesn't work, you can't get that number of people in and out of that area without transit. And so we're essentially selling those places short, writing them off and saying those places are no longer important to us if we don't fund transit properly and provide the service that we need. Mathieu: There's, of course, the big COVID story here. This is happening because of COVID; people started working from home. With regard to the cars, though, the reason why I said a separate conversation \u2014 and we can do it all right now \u2014 is because even when people are coming back to work, they might not feel safe on public transportation. And I wonder how much of a concern that is for you because people are buying cars again. Chris, we're seeing these used cars and new cars at levels we haven't noticed in quite a long time. Let's say the T goes full service, but people are afraid to take public transit. Then what? Dempsey: Well, look, I think that we need to get people vaccinated because that's going to actually solve this issue. And we need to be focused on that question for sure. It's totally understandable that people have a fear that public transit might be a vector for the disease. You know, there's really nowhere else in greater Boston in our daily lives where you're as close to a stranger as when you're packed on to a commuter rail train or a green line train at rush hour. That's right. It's pretty uncomfortable. And so you think, \"Well, gee, I'm not supposed to be around strangers. That's what all the experts are saying. I shouldn't be on public transit.\" But in fact, there is not significant evidence, really any evidence at all that public transit has been a vector for the disease. People are pretty good about wearing masks. There's enough separation because of the lower ridership. We have not seen cases tied to public transit in Boston or really anywhere else in the country or the world. I am not dismissing the fear that people have. There's a basic discomfort and I've had it myself in the times that I've taken transit since the pandemic. I was on the T Saturday and it's not nearly as frequent as it was before the pandemic. But I have been riding it on occasion, mostly to do things like go to the grocery store. And the answer here is to get people vaccinated. We want to do that as fast as possible and get back to normalcy. You know, actually, the MBTA first announced these service cuts in early November, coincidentally, the very same day that Pfizer announced that its vaccine had been successful in the trials, so the T was planning this long before we had some hope that we're going to come out of this pandemic. And again, it's another reason we think they should be reassessing [the cuts]. In addition to the fact that they've received another 300 million dollars in federal aid that allows them to end these cuts and go back to regular service. And they're making a choice not to do that and to continue the cuts instead. Mathieu: Chris Dempsey, Director of Transportation for Massachusetts, appreciate your checking in this morning. Let's talk again when the subway and bus routes are added to this. Appreciate your insights. ",

      "body": "One of the great unknowns vexing transportation planners is whether all the people who have been working from home will return to the office after the coronavirus pandemic eases. And if they do, how will they get there?When COVID-19 forced the shutdown of businesses in March, the expectation was for a quick end to the pandemic and then back to business as usual. But recent polls of employees, like the one done by the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, have shown otherwise. Chamber President and CEO Jim Rooney said while one third of respondents say that they will return to the office full time, twice as many say they will return to the office only part time and otherwise continue to work from home. And, the survey shows, that\u2019s even if concerns about COVID-19 fade as more people become vaccinated.Outgoing Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack said all those people continuing to work from home \u2014 and not commuting to work \u2014 will lessen demand for public transit. And those who do physically return to work, she said, will probably drive because with far fewer commuters, highway congestion will drop dramatically. And she predicts a long-term decline in ridership on all forms of public transportation.The chairman of the MBTA's Fiscal Management Control Board, Joe Aiello, said despite the change in commuting patterns, the T must commit itself to providing service to essential workers.\u201cThere is a big core of folks that depend upon us every day to deliver service at an affordable price point,\" he said. \"And we're going to continue that commitment to those folks just as they were committed to us.\u201d Aiello admited the financial challenges of continuing to provide that service are daunting, and he said the MBTA will need more federal aid to do it. But he's hopeful that the Biden administration will push hard for its proposed trillion-dollar-plus infrastructure plan. To hear the full story, click on the audio link above",

      "body": "Whether Boston will hold a special election to replace Mayor Marty Walsh should he win U.S. Senate confirmation as Secretary of Labor and vacate his office before March 5 is becoming a political cliff hanger almost as thrilling as the story of Walsh snagging his appointment in the first place.Even though many agree skipping the special election is a practical, cost-saving. pandemic risk reducing move for the city, a pair of conflicting legal opinions has complicated decision-making for at least several of the thirteen councilors.On one side is Councilor Ricardo Arroyo who launched the petition to skip the charter-mandated special election. Guided by an advisory opinion from an attorney with the state ethics commission \u2013 the independent agency with the power to interpret and enforce state conflict of interest law \u2013 he asserts that all councilors can and should vote to advance the petition. On the other side, you have City Councilor Lydia Edwards, the first-time chair of the council\u2019s government operations committee, who maintains that councilors who fancy the mayor\u2019s seat should proceed on the matter with caution.Edwards points to an opinion she sought from a city council staff attorney, a move she said was a matter of due diligence given the unique nature of the petition to override the charter.  \u201cThis has to be done right. If we\u2019re going to not follow our charter, I want to cross every \u2018T\u2019 and dot every \u2018I.\u2019 Why wouldn\u2019t we support that,\u201d she said when asked about the timing of the review.Smack in the middle is City Council President Kim Janey, who becomes mayor the minute Walsh resigns. In a statement issued through the strategic communications firm Northwind Strategies, Janey pointed to the ethics commission\u2019s read:\u201cI will of course follow whatever the ethics rules require. The State Ethics Commission has provided an advisory that indicates there is no conflict of interest,\u201d Janey\u2019s statement said. \u201cThis discussion shouldn\u2019t let us lose sight of the fact that special elections historically disenfranchise communities of color and low income, and that the Council\u2019s focus should be what is best for the residents of Boston.\" Watching with interest are councilors Michele Wu and Andrea Campbell, the only declared mayoral candidates at this point. Although WCVB reports Police Commissioner William Gross and City Councilor Michael Flaherty are also thinking of running. Wu told the Boston Herald she\u2019s seeking independent legal advice on the matter. She has expressed support for skipping the special election despite topping the at-large ticket in 2019 and being well-positioned to win a special election.A source familiar with the Councilor Andrea Campbell\u2019s campaign told GBH News she supports a public conversation to weigh whether the special election should be scrapped, but has not taken a position on the matter. She is seeking her own advisory opinion from the state ethics commission. And on the sidelines is At-Large Councilor Annissa Essaibi-George who is also considering a mayoral bid.Essaibi-George told GBH News she\u2019s decided to abstain from voting on the petition altogether.\u201cAs a potential candidate this decision could directly impact me and a potential campaign. While I believe ensuring safe and equitable access to the ballot is critical, I believe I need to hold myself to the highest possible ethical standard,\u201d Essaibi-George said. \u201cI trust my colleagues in government to do what is best for the people of Boston and guarantee that their voices are heard.\"MassVOTE and several advocacy groups are calling for the suspension of the special election this year on the grounds that it would fatigue voters, expose them to the coronavirus and cost the city money. The coalition has planned a press conference on the issue Tuesday afternoon. The Boston City Charter is very specific on the matter. If the mayor leaves office o or before March 5, the city must hold a special election: first a primary (in the spring) and then a final (summer). And then repeat the process again in September and November.Arroyo's home rule petition would do away with the special elections, in the same way that Lawrence received legislative dispensation. Gov. Charlie Baker said that he's sign a Boston home rule move to streamline the election. And election czar Sec. of State Bill Galvin has also spoken up in favor.The council\u2019s committee on government operations holds a hearing on the petition this afternoon.Correction: This story originally misstated Police Commissioner William Gross' name.",

      "body": "Governor Charlie Baker has received criticism over the past few weeks over how COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out across Massachusetts. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with GBH News State House reporter Mike Deehan about updates to Baker's vaccination rollout plan, and what the governor has to say about the federal government's role in the process. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: So the governor announced the broad strokes here of the vaccine distribution plan back in December. Phase One: medical workers, nursing home residents, first responders. But now we are expanding things, it appears, widely for Phase Two. This gets complicated, so we want to be as specific as we can here. We're going to be seeing more people and younger people than first thought here, Mike. What can you tell us? Mike Deehan: Yeah, you kind of have to approach this the way that the economic shutdowns and rollbacks have been happening. There are phases and there are steps within those phases. So right now, we're in Phase One of the COVID vaccine plan, and at first that was nursing homes and medical people, and then it went to first responders. There are multiple steps there. That's the same as in Phase Two. First of all, 75-year-olds are going to be at the beginning of Phase Two starting on Monday. And then we're going to have subsequent steps with people slightly lower priority. But as far as how Phase One went, it was bumpy, but Baker said he expected it to be bumpy. This is a man who likes a pilot program, so you can really see Phase One as his vaccination plan pilot program. But if you look at what he said in December versus now, near the end of January and going into February, everything has been on target for the limited promises that Baker made back in December when he rolled out that plan. The criticism back then and throughout has been that that plan just wasn't wide enough. So he's been on target \u2014 mission accomplished. However, the plan itself has some flaws, according to some people. So now there are a lot of Beacon Hill Democrats and people in the medical community, including Senate President Spilka as far as Democrats, who really have criticized the lack of information \u2014 when do I get vaccinated? How wide is it going, and just the speed of it overall? Watch: Who is to blame if the expanded vaccine rollout is delayed?Where To Point The Finger If Vaccine Rollout Lags: The State Or The Feds?Mathieu: As we've been reporting, people 65 and older will be in the pool by the end of February. We're looking at 160-something [vaccination] sites. We only have a couple of seconds left, Mike. Does that address the criticism the governor's received so far? Deehan: It should. If the criticism was it's not wide enough, it's not big enough, it's not fast enough, Phase Two is going to be so much bigger and wider that if it is as successful as Phase One, it should at least alleviate some of the concerns people have had.

This year, the coronavirus pandemic has upended nearly every sector and industry in the state and forced the Republican governor to make difficult policy choices. Jon Keller, WBZ-TV Political Analyst, says the optics will also be a big departure for Baker, as he will deliver the speech alone in his office and not in front of a joint session of legislators.\u201cIt takes away something that has really benefited Baker: the annual image of being pretty warmly embraced by the overwhelmingly Democratic legislature,\u201d he told host Joe Mathieu on GBH's Morning Edition today, adding that the \u201cbucolic bipartisan atmosphere\u201d of the Baker era, a contrast from gridlock in Washington, is exactly what voters want right now. Those optics will also \u201cconvey a sense of how lonely it is to be the governor these days,\u201d Keller said.Keller noted that Baker\u2019s approval ratings have dipped slightly, but have \"defied gravity\" and still remained high throughout the pandemic. Baker\u2019s best bet for a successful address this evening, according to Keller, is to stress his bipartisanship efforts while recognizing the dire and somber state of the pandemic. \u201cI would point to the police reform bill as something that\u2019s unprecedented and represented a difficult meeting of the minds on Beacon Hill,\u201d Keller said about the bill, which will establish a new oversight board for law enforcement in the state. Watch: What should Governor Baker say in his annual State of the Commonwealth address?What Governor Baker Should Say In His Annual State Of The Commonwealth AddressBaker is up for re-election in 2022, and Keller said that now is an apt time for Baker to make his case before Democrats like Attorney General Maura Healey and former Congressman Joe Kennedy III jump into the gubernatorial race. \u201cHe [Baker] needs to make a case right now for why his brand of governance is the way to go forward,\u201d Keller said.With numerous challenges facing the state in healthcare, economic recovery, higher education, tourism, and transportation, Keller said that Baker has an opportunity to show he\u2019s still the right person for the job. \u201cBaker\u2019s best case to make is: \u2018Look, I\u2019ve proven I can work in a bipartisan way and that\u2019s going to be needed more than ever going forward,\u2019\u201d Keller said. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t throw me overboard now.\u2019\u201d",

      "body": "This story was updated at 4:10 p.m. with new information.Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is canceling a new course focused on evaluating the efficacy of military-style counterinsurgency techniques used to fight crime in Springfield, Massachusetts, after critics raised concerns about the ethical implications of that approach.The decision was announced Monday afternoon in an email from Harvard SEAS Dean Frank J. Doyle.\"I want to assure members of the SEAS community that we are aware of, and take seriously, the concerns that some of you raised about the design and pedagogy of the proposed course,\" Doyle wrote.\"The SEAS course approval process under which new courses are vetted prior to being added to the course catalog is intended to ensure that our curriculum fully aligns with the School\u2019s mission, vision, and values,\" Doyle added. \"During the coming days, the SEAS leadership will undertake a review of our course approval policies and procedures to determine if there are opportunities to further strengthen that system.\"The course in question was titled Data Fusion in Complex Systems: A Case Study. If it had been offered this semester, it would have focused on evaluating the use of a policing technique known as Counter-Criminal Continuum policing, or C3, to disrupt gang and drug activity Springfield. A letter dated Jan. 24 and signed by a number of Harvard students and organizations raised numerous concerns about the course, including whether its research activities would have obligations not to harm human subjects, whether Springfield residents' privacy would be sufficiently protected, and whether \"the computational nature of the initiative ... naturalize[s] policies and practices that have had disparate impacts on Black and Brown communities.\" Kit Parker, the professor who had planned to offer the course, served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Army, and has been researching the efficacy of counterinsurgency techniques used in Afghanistan and Iraq as applied in Springfield for nearly a decade. \"C3 policing is designed to build legitimacy of law enforcement, [through] partnering relationships with the local citizens, to achieve the goals of a safer community,\" Parker, the Tarr Family Professor of Bioengineering and Applied Physics, said in an email.The C3 technique was pioneered by Michael Cutone, a retired Massachusetts State Trooper and the founder of a private company, Trinity Project C3, that specializes in the approach. In a June 2020 interview with GBH News' Boston Public Radio, Cutone, who also served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Army, cited C3 policing as a potential model for police reform.\"The policing program I started has nothing to do with militarizing the police,\" Cutone said. \"It's basically taking the best practices I learned from community engagement with my time with the Green Berets, then applying them in the civilian law-enforcement sector.\" In that interview, Cutone also said that in the C3 framework, members of law enforcement take their cues from local residents.\u201cThe folks that came up with the best ideas to help their community were the citizens, and the cops were able to help them implement it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a novel idea.\u201dNeither the use of C3 techniques in Springfield nor Parker's interest in the method are new. The Harvard SEAS website includes multiple articles on those topics, including 2012 stories from the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Harvard Gazette, and Nature.The Jan. 24 letter from the students said the planned course represents \u201cthe disturbing historical trend of universities like Harvard \u2026 supporting violence against marginalized communities,\u201d and accused Harvard of \u201ccontinu[ing] to be at the cutting edge of providing the next generation tools of oppression.\u201d It also noted that policing is not Parker\u2019s area of expertise, and suggested he might personally profit from research that students would have conducted. In a statement provided to GBH News, Parker said that is not the case. \u201cI get nothing from this project financially, only the personal satisfaction of trying to contribute to an understanding of an impoverished community who has made some very courageous decisions about taking control of their fate from violent criminal gangs,\u201d he wrote. Parker also said the course \u2014 and his ongoing research into policing in Springfield \u2014 represent much-needed engagement between academia and the wider world. \u201c[I]f we are good stewards of our opportunities at Harvard, we need to endeavor to get in the trenches on social reforms and do some work \u2026 drag hard problems back to Harvard and work with students to solve them,\u201d Parker wrote. \u201cI expect Harvard to display the moral courage to support its faculty who endeavor to lead such projects \u2026 and their academic freedom,\u201d he added. Springfield City Councilor Victor Davila, who represents the city\u2019s sixth ward, tells GBH News the C3 approach has boosted community engagement and helped identify local trouble spots, including illegal chop shops and locations with dangerous traffic. \u201cC3 isn\u2019t a fix all, but it\u2019s a darn good way of combatting quality of life issues and combatting crime,\u201d Davila said. The approach \u201chelps to foster a good relationship with the police department and to open up trust \u2014 a trust which, by the way, is sorely needed in Springfield,\u201d Davila added. \u201cWe have had issues in Springfield for a long time. There\u2019s a lot of work to do. But I think that some gains have been made.\u201d In an email, Paul Karoff, a spokesperson for Harvard SEAS, said the cancellation was Parker\u2019s choice, writing: \u201cplease understand that the decision not to offer the course this spring was [Professor] Parker\u2019s.\u201d Parker disputes that characterization, however, saying that after his co-instructor dropped out last week, he still hoped to teach the course as scheduled. When he was unable to find a replacement, and university administration suggested rescheduling the course for this fall, Parker agreed \u2014 but also suggested, in an email provided to GBH News, that Harvard make a statement supporting his course, as well as others that address controversial issues and might elicit a similar backlash. Ultimately, Parker said of Harvard, \u201ctheir passive action effectively shut us down.\u201d ",

The move will allow several types of establishments \u2014 including museums, movie theaters, aquariums, and indoor fitness centers and recreational facilities \u2014 to resume operating, albeit at limited capacity, with 25 percent occupancy allowed. \u201cThroughout the pandemic, Boston and our public-health department have taken a cautious approach,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWe will only move forward with reopening if the public-health experts feel that it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201dRight now, Walsh said, Boston\u2019s COVID numbers are headed in the right direction.

      "body": "Not unexpected, but stunning nevertheless: Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron is retiring after eight years at the helm, according to Brian Stelter of CNN. Baron was widely regarded as the best newspaper editor of his generation, and his leadership \u2014 not just at the Post but as a voice for journalism and the First Amendment \u2014 will be hugely missed.Under Baron, the Post was fearless, negotiating the bizarre media landscape dominated by Donald Trump with a sure-footedness that its larger competitor, The New York Times, never quite seemed to master. Before coming to the Post, Baron was the editor of The Boston Globe, where he led the paper's reporting that showed Cardinal Bernard Law was deeply involved in the pedophile-priest crisis.I interviewed Baron several times over the years, including in early 2016 for my book \"The Return of the Moguls: How Jeff Bezos and John Henry Are Remaking Newspapers for the Twenty-First Century.\" Here is an excerpt about Baron's reaction when he learned in August 2013 that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was buying the Post:\u201cI was completely shocked, obviously,\u201d Baron said when I asked him about his reaction to the news that Bezos would buy the Post. \u201cI told people when I came here that while the Times would probably like to sell the Globe, it was highly unlikely that Don Graham would be selling the Washington Post. So I was kind of stunned when I heard about it. But I thought that it could have some real advantages for us\u201d\u2014a reference to Bezos\u2019s preference for growth over cutting and his deep understanding of technology and consumer behavior. \u201cI did not know if it would be a good thing for me personally,\u201d Baron added, \u201cbecause obviously when a new owner comes in he has the absolute right to pick who he wants to run the organization that he has acquired. He said positive things at the beginning, but my sense was that it would be a year of figuring out the place and deciding what he wanted to do.\u201dBezos, to his credit, realized what he had inherited, kept Baron in place and by all accounts left him alone to do his job. The Post has built its paid digital subscription base from around 100,000 to 200,000 in early 2016 to 3 million today, and the newsroom has grown from 580 to more than 1,000 since Bezos bought the paper. It's also been profitable for five years.And the Post's main selling point has been the excellence of its journalism. Baron is going to be incredibly difficult to replace.",

This includes mass vaccination sites at places like Gillette Stadium and Fenway Park, but also smaller ones in grocery stores and pharmacies.For many its welcomed news. For others, like state Sen. Eric Lesser, a Democrat who represents the First Hampden and Hampshire District, it falls short.According to the state's vaccination website, as of Jan. 26 there were 13 locations in the western half of the state. This includes just four locations in Hampden County, which Lesser represents, all in the Springfield area.Baker did announce plans for a mass vaccination site in Springfield, to open on Friday, but Lesser said that's not enough.\"It's going to be at an abandoned Macy's at a mall in Springfield that can at max accomodate about 500 doses a day,\" Lesser said. \"It would take about a year to vaccinate the whole city of Springfield at that rate.

      "body": "Gov. Charlie Baker used his annual State of the Commonwealth address Tuesday night to reflect on the toll the coronavirus pandemic has taken on Massachusetts and to chart a path forward. The speech was brief: just 23 minutes. Like President Joe Biden's inaugural, it was long on aspiration and inspiration and short on policy specifics.An unacknowledged question also hung over Baker's remarks.1. Is He Running Again Or What?It's time to start asking Baker if he plans to run for a third term. Baker's address was hardly the kind of swansong that departing Boston Mayor Marty Walsh delivered in his State of the City two weeks ago. Instead, Baker concentrated on the here-and-now of the pandemic and how the state will recover after vaccinations bring life back to normal. Still, the 2022 election season is just around the corner, and Democratic candidates will soon come out of the woodwork. Keep an eye on Harvard government professor Danielle Allen. She is unannounced and still exploring a run. But like the once unknown Deval Patrick, she might prove a formidable challenger.Baker began 2021 with an approval rating of 73%, according to MassINC Polling Group, a favorable sign that his streak of magnificent political luck isn't about to run out. If Baker does choose to step aside, his lieutenant governor and two-time running mate, Karyn Polito, will tap the campaign war chest she's raised over her years as Baker's deputy to make a go herself. She'll need the money, since without Baker in the mix, a heavyweight like Attorney General Maura Healey could see the open seat as rightfully belonging under Democratic control. 2. A Year Of COVID-19Baker used the speech to celebrate the efforts of Massachusetts residents in fighting the pandemic while marking the tremendous loss of life and sacrifices made by the medical community, businesses, frontline workers, the unemployed, students, teachers and more.\"The pandemic changed everything,\" Baker solemnly declared. \"It was much more than just the worst public health crisis of the last hundred years. It came with economic calamity, severe job loss, business closures, anxiety, fear, civil unrest, riots, racial injustice, isolation, death and loss.\"Most of Baker's address was dedicated to the strategies and programs his administration has launched to deal with the pandemic. The governor covered everything from small business loans and food security programs to a massive testing infrastructure he hopes to build into a nation-leading vaccination system.3. The Future Of Transportation Since the pandemic has ended commutes for most Massachusetts office workers, the traffic woes of 2019, and the calls for new ways to deal with them, have quieted. Record low ridership on the MBTA has led the Baker-appointed Fiscal Management and Control Board to cut underused service. The governor himself exercised several proposals for limiting congestion from a recent bond bill, saying that now is not the time to reinvent the transportation system.Still, the commuters and the traffic will return, and Baker will find himself faced with a Legislature more eager to raise taxes to pay for public transit \u2014 or to make drivers pay more to do so. Add to that his own board's call for new revenue to be dedicated to large-scale projects, and it will soon be crunch time \u2014 again \u2014 for transportation reform.Part of the traditional victory lap portion of his speech, Baker touched on housing legislation he had been asking lawmakers to pass for years that finally came to his desk at the very end of last year's session. The new law reduced the amount of support needed at the town and city level to approve new housing projects, which Baker insists will spur new construction and alleviate the housing crisis.\"Communities can now move much more quickly to permit and build the housing that we all know we need,\" Baker said.Though his speech didn't allude to it, Baker will soon have a big opportunity to weigh in on the future of transportation by naming a new MassDOT secretary to replace the D.C.-bound Stephanie Pollack.4. The Future of WorkAs with changes to how we travel and where we live, how Massachusetts conducts its work has and will continue to change drastically as a result of the pandemic. Baker seems keen to figure out how to prepare the state's economy for a newly remote workforce.Baker highlighted \"the future of work\" as a major issue \"we need to get right\" as the state comes out of the pandemic, and he warned of \"big consequences\" if public policy doesn't meet the demands of a changing jobs market.\u201cIt\u2019s critical that we understand this and lean into what this reset means so that we create the community-building, housing, economic development and transportation programs that align with these changes,\" Baker said.5. It's Budget SeasonBaker did not tip his hand on what will come out tomorrow in his annual budget proposal. The governor had already disclosed to municipal leaders last week that he wants to fully fund the first year of the seven year, $1.5 billion Student Opportunity Act that passed in 2019 and was shelved last year because of the downturn in state tax revenue and the opportunity to fund schools with federal relief money.Baker's budget proposal, known as \"House 1\" in Beacon Hill parlance, is the starting point for the annual process that determines how much the state will spend on services like health care, aid to cities and towns and much, much more.Baker's economists and legislative leaders have agreed on an estimate for 3.5% growth in tax revenue in the fiscal year beginning in July, meaning the state's annual budget will likely grow from $45.9 billion to a hearty $47.5 billion.",

      "body": "In his first week in the White House, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that will help expand the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to address the growing problem of food insecurity across the nation. GBH Morning Edition host Joe Mathieu spoke with the President and CEO of Project Bread, Erin McAleer, about what the Biden Administration's move could mean for families struggling in Massachusetts. The transcript below has been edited for clarity. Joe Mathieu: Give us a sense of what this means for your mission. Erin McAleer: The food insecurity crisis coming out of COVID is huge. Right now in Massachusetts, over 20 percent of households with children are food insecure. That's twice what we saw pre-pandemic. And for Black and Latinx families, it's double that \u2014 40 percent of Black and Latinx families in Massachusetts are food insecure. So we need some big, bold efforts, and I think for us, the fact that President Biden made this one of his initial actions his first week in the White House is a testament to both the severity of the crisis and the fact that he's going to prioritize solutions for addressing it. Mathieu: I talked to you 10 months ago, and it takes a minute to get your head back to where we were last March with so much uncertainty. You had just canceled the Walk for Hunger, and you told us at the time that you saw the number of people in need quadruple in two weeks. Where are we now and how desperately are you waiting for relief 10 months later? McAleer: The crisis is still very much here. The economic implications of COVID-19, we all know, are huge. But for individuals who are low income or individuals that have had to leave the workforce to care for children at home, it's been dire. [At] our food source hotline, we've doubled staff of people answering calls. The call volume varies. Some days it's four times the normal call volume, some days at six times the normal call volume. So the reality is a lot of people are really struggling to make ends meet. And it comes down to finances; they just don't have the money to afford food. That's why we're so thrilled with President Biden's approach. He's focused on the program, SNAP, and Pandemic EBT that put money back into people's pockets to both purchase food, but also use that money to pay for other necessary expenses. Mathieu: You've been helping people connect with and get signed up for the SNAP program. Is demand for that program equal to demands for your organization? McAleer: Yeah, we focused our efforts on SNAP primarily for a few reasons. SNAP is a program that's meant to expand during economic downturns. If you look at the data from October 2019 to October 2020, over 125,000 more people in Massachusetts are now on this program. It's meant to do that. It's meant to contract and expand during economic times. So it's a program that, again, puts money back into people's pockets; it allows them to meet their needs for food, but also other expenses. So, yes, for our organization, anyone who calls us, we refer them to any resource that we can identify, but we also really encourage them to consider this specific program. Watch: What needs to happen next to combat food insecurity?Raw HtmlMcAleer: Right. I think as far as the hunger crisis goes, President Biden has smartly taken the action and he has the authority to do [it] under executive action. He's also put some recommendations back to Congress, which are ones that we really endorse. But at Project Bread, our focus is making sure everyone who is hungry knows about all of these different programs. There's a lot of programs out there. There's SNAP, as you mentioned, there's Pandemic EBT, which is for school kids, there's WIC. If you're the person who is food insecure, it can be a little overwhelming. So that's where we come in. We really try to help people connect to these programs. The reality is there's a lot of people who are food insecure right now who still aren't signed up for SNAP. We know that from our work in health centers. So that's where we're so grateful that President Biden has taken these actions \u2014 but our work continues. We need to get as many people signed up for these programs [as possible] so that they can see the increases that he's recommended going forward. Mathieu: Are you hoping for or supporting passage of this stimulus package that President Biden is proposing? McAleer: Yes, definitely. The hunger provisions specifically are absolutely necessary. Mathieu: What do we need to know about them? McAleer: Without going too far into the weeds, I think the main things are that they're expanding the amount people that are getting. So, for example, 500,000 school kids in Massachusetts are eligible for Pandemic EBT. [Biden] is recommending we increase that by 15 percent. That alone will keep families out of food pantry lines. It will just allow them to have more money in their pocket. He's also recommending we re-evaluate how we determine how much money people get for SNAP. Right now, it's called the Thrifty Food Plan and I won't go too wonky on this, but it's outdated. The premise of the plan right now is that people do all of their prep at home. They wouldn't buy canned beans, as an example. They would buy whole beans and boil them, and the reality is that people don't have that time to prep food. So really, it's just updating it to the realities of what people are doing today, which would increase the amount of money that they're getting. So lots of efforts under his administration and their authority to just get more money into people's pockets. Mathieu: It sounds to me, Erin, like you're very much in the information business right now. I realize that you're supporting people and providing food assistance, but it's informational assistance [and] directing people to the right resources if they're new to this. McAleer: That's a core part of our work \u2014 making it easier for people to access food where they already are. So we're supporting school meal sites across Massachusetts; there are over 1,000. So if families are going to pick up remote learning materials, they're also able to get food. But then also doing direct case management, if somebody just needs help navigating. If you think about a mom at home with a few kids and maybe her parents living there, too, and they're food insecure, that's a lot of different programs. So for her to be able to navigate which ones who is eligible for and how to sign up, that's where we come in. We try to make it as easy as possible. Mathieu: Any news on the Walk for Hunger this year? McAleer: Yeah, it's going to be virtual again, which I don't think is too shocking. But [it's on] the first Sunday in May, and our walkers are so dedicated, they really rose to the occasion last year and we hope that they'll rise to the occasion again. Mathieu: That's great. Erin McAleer is CEO at Project Bread. And I want to thank you for all the work that you're doing to keep our community together, Erin. Thanks for being here on Morning Edition. McAleer: Thank you, Joe. And if anyone out there is facing food insecurity, give us a call at the food source hotline. It's 1-800-645-8333. It's confidential [and] we can support you in 180 languages. Please pick up the phone. We're there to assist you. ",

      "body": "Like most people these days, Malden High School teacher Jessica Gold Boots needed a little good news. That came with the Baker administration's proposal Wednesday to fund a landmark education spending law that expands state funding and redirects more money to low-income school districts.\"Now more than ever, it's incredibly important,\" Boots said.After last year's essentially flat education budget \u2014 and a pandemic \u2014 many educators can instantly think of several ways to spend a cash infusion, from hiring more teachers and counselors to the creating enrichment and summer programs to address learning loss.Last year, the state delayed its promise to begin a seven-year process of investing $1.4 billion into public schools. Known as the Student Opportunity Act, the 2019 law recalibrated the state's K-12 public school funding formula. Under the new rules, low-income school districts would receive a larger proportion of state education dollars, as would districts with greater numbers of English language learners and special education students. Gov. Charlie Baker's proposed state budget, unveiled Wednesday, included an additonal $198 million in aid to school districts under the new formula. Baker also proposed allowing cities and towns to count $114 million in federal dollars toward their local contribution under the law, adding that the proposed increase honors his commitment to fully-fund the law. Teachers unions dispute that interpretation, saying that because he effectively promised the money last year, this year's funding should be bigger if not double. The new budget plan now goes to the Legislature.Many teachers said they would have desperately welcomed extra funds before the pandemic. Lea Serena, a second-grade teacher in Boston, called the boost long overdue. At Mather Elementary, in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, where she teaches, the roof leaks, as it has for decades. She knows because she was once a student there.The pandemic has created other new and urgent problems for her and her students. She said some students in her remote learning classes have become withdrawn. One will not attend online classes unless she teaches one-on-one. Another who used to hug her on the playground cannot be coaxed out of silence during online classes. \"And then just some students who are not talking as much as I know that they will talk if we were in person,\" Serena said. Additional English language teachers and multilingual counselors who are trained to help students experiencing trauma would help, she said.Boots, the Malden High teacher, said her students are also in need of emotional support. Many students are considering leaving school to work because their parents have lost restaurant jobs. Some want to help their families pay the rent.Additional funding couldn't fix a student's housing situation, she said. But it could help the school hire support and \"wraparound\" staff who might prevent a student from dropping out.Boots also said increased funding has been needed for years prior to the pandemic to hire librarians \u2014 or reopen libraries to pay for after school and summer school enrichment programs or hire teachers for Advanced Placement and honors courses.\"Sometimes people will say, 'You can't just throw money at the problem,'\" Boots said. \"And while that's a great soundbite, money actually does matter in public education.\"",

      "body": "In his first State of the Commonwealth address in the time of COVID-19, Gov. Baker yesterday praised the essential workers who have stepped up during the pandemic and also lamented the heavy toll the virus has taken on the state. While noting the immense challenges for vaccine delivery, transportation, unemployment, business closures and economic recovery, Gov. Baker declared, \u201cI know the state of our Commonwealth is strong.\u201d When asked by host Joe Mathieu on GBH's Morning Edition if he thought Baker's optimistic assessment was correct, GBH News senior editor Peter Kadzis responded, \u201cYes, surprisingly so.\" \"I think his sincerity came through,\" Kadzis said. \"Baker is still Charlie Baker. He\u2019s first and foremost a manager \u2014 he\u2019s like a super town manager. He\u2019s a guy trying to fix everything and get things done. That really came through last night.\u201dBaker set out to draw a strong contrast between the political atmosphere in Massachusetts and the \u201cout of control\u201d affairs in Washington throughout his address, Kadzis said. \u201cBaker\u2019s message, and I think it resonated, is that Beacon Hill, for all the differences they have up there, is better than the rest of the nation, and that Beacon Hill is not Capitol Hill.\u201dWatch: Kadzis on Baker worrying about his own backyard.Raw HtmlIn an unexpected moment in his speech, Baker referenced Ted Lasso, the Apple TV+ sports comedy starring Jason Sudeikis as an American football coach who starts coaching an English soccer team. Baker pointed to the moment when the character references the famous Walt Whitman line, \u201cBe curious \u2014 not judgmental,\u201d as a lesson for the way to move forward in a deeply divided political climate.\u201cBaker\u2019s politics last night were to be above politics,\u201d Kadzis said, noting that Baker was aiming for bipartisanship. \u201cHe transcended that. He totally raised himself above politics, which, paradoxically, was a very shrewd political move.\u201dThe question on the mind of many citizens and pundits alike is whether Baker will throw his hat in the ring and run for another term in 2022. His address last night would indicate that\u2019s still up in the air, Kadzis said. But, he added, \u201cI\u2019ll go out on a limb and say I think he is running. Whether he runs or not is going to be a conversation he has with his wife. I suspect his wife will have the final say.\u201d",

      "body": "On a recent chilly January morning, a dozen or so people sat in folding chairs, spaced in a wide circle inside Waltham\u2019s First Parish church.They\u2019d gathered for a weekly leadership meeting hosted by Chaplains on the Way, a small interfaith nonprofit group focused on assisting and \u201cwalking with\u201d Waltham residents experiencing homelessness.Leading the meeting was Patrick McCarthy, who \u2014 like most attending this meeting \u2014 is currently homeless.The group has been meeting like this since the summer and has, over the course of those months, helped put together a coalition of Waltham residents \u2014 housed and un-housed, they like to say \u2014 who have prodded, cajoled and pushed their city and community institutions to better respond to the needs of people experiencing homelessness in this time of crisis.COVID-19 has put enormous pressure on the patchwork of safety nets for those facing homelessness in Massachusetts, but it has also prodded some communities to step up and innovate around needs that have long existed, were made worse, or simply exposed, by the pandemic.DSC_3311.jpgWhen shutdown measures went into effect last spring, McCarthy, like others experiencing homelessness, could not follow state guidance to \u2018shelter at home,\u2019 because he didn\u2019t have one.Nor could he easily maintain physical separation while staying in a congregate, dorm-like setting, like the Bristol Lodge; early in the pandemic, infection rates at some congregate shelters rose as high as 30%, although they have plummeted since shelters de-populated and introduced new safety measures.And when overnight shelters closed during the day, McCarthy and other guests found that many of the other services they relied on had vanished.\u201cThe libraries shut down; the day center that we used to go to in the afternoon shut down; the restaurants closed,\u201d McCarthy recalls. \u201cSo we really had no place to go.\u201dChaplains on the Way began hosting weekly meetings, inviting those currently \u201cun-housed,\u201d to organize and strategize around trying to solve some of those problems.Remote meetings weren\u2019t generally feasible, chaplain Justi Godoy recalls, so they\u2019d gather in a church parking lot.\u201cWe got a bunch of those kind of beach lounge chairs and we\u2019d make a circle six feet apart in the parking lot, in the shade somewhere and have our meetings there,\u201d Godoy says.McCarthy was an early attendee.\u201cI said, \"Listen, there\u2019s two things we need right now: We need a physical place to go in the afternoons, and we need bathrooms \u2014 porta potties.'\u201dThe group sent a letter to Waltham Mayor Jeanette McCarthy, asking for outdoor toilets to be cleaned and serviced regularly and to meet to discuss options for indoor spaces where people could be safe and warm during the day.And it worked.(Required)The city installed two outdoor toilets beside the library. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d said Patrick McCarthy.The group helped convince the city to fund weekend hours at the nearby Community Day Center; and this fall, the Bristol Lodge men\u2019s shelter announced it would stay open all day throughout the winter.Waltham isn\u2019t the only community that has responded to demands by advocates and people experiencing homelessness for more and better services that go beyond basic shelter.And some of those communities are finding creative solutions.In Brockton, the city\u2019s main shelter provider commandeered a YMCA to house people at the peak of infections, and is now converting a hotel into permanent housing.In Cambridge city officials recently signed off on a new shelter site, overseen by state officials, and agreed to fund the city\u2019s first 24-hour warming station.Jim Stewart runs the First Church shelter in Harvard Square, and says those changes came because the community stood up for itself.\u201cIt\u2019s not very compelling just to have some loud-mouthed activist provider like myself saying you gotta do this, you gotta do that,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cFirst and foremost, it\u2019s a recognition of needs that these poor and homeless people identified for themselves.\u201dThe COVID-19 crisis has, in some cases, opened doors to state services for people who were qualified but not enrolled, says Keith Wales, homeless outreach director for Elliot Community Human Services, which contracts with the state to enroll people.Before the coronavirus, Wales says, he spent much of his time simply trying to find the people his organization serves.But state quarantine sites, especially for people who would otherwise be homeless, have created gathering spots where Wales and his team have been able to locate and enroll hundreds more clients in state mental health, counseling and housing programs.\u201cWe have an opportunity to engage these folks that wind up at these sites secondary to their COVID diagnosis,\u201d Wales said.DSC_3329.jpgPatrick McCarthy and the others at the leadership meeting in Waltham are moving on to their next challenge: securing MBTA passes that could be shared among anyone homeless in Waltham.All share the goal, but an awkward tension arises as they discuss who, exactly, would be responsible for making sure a limited number of MBTA passes were being returned and shared equitably.To McCarthy, the answer seems clear: The chaplains should hold the cards, he says, because it will be harder for the homeless participants to keep track of them.But the chaplains push back. They take very seriously the idea that it should be those experiencing homelessness leading the group, and they don\u2019t want to be seen as being \u201cin charge\u201d of anything, including the T passes.Eventually, the group decides to table the issue, especially since they haven\u2019t actually secured any passes yet, or figured out how they\u2019d pay for them.It\u2019s difficult work, fighting for services from the ground up, but the group is proud of what they\u2019ve achieved so far. It\u2019s slow progress \u2014 but it\u2019s theirs.",

      "body": "Baker administration finance officials are characterizing the governor's fiscal 2022 spending plan as something of a recovery budget, and the $45.6 billion proposal includes several measures targeting areas spotlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.In public health, Gov. Charlie Baker's budget will include spending to support staffing at the state laboratory and public health hospitals and continue $10 million in grants for local boards of health, according to the Executive Office of Administration and Finance.After a year that's driven most government services, at least temporarily, to the virtual realm, the budget proposes $138.8 million in spending by the Executive Office of Technology Services and Security, for investments around improved cybersecurity and supporting partially remote workforces.The budget for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency would double under Baker's budget, to $4.1 million. State finance officials said the pandemic and the 2018 Merrimack Valley gas disaster underscored the importance of MEMA's ability to respond rapidly, and that the agency can function better when operating from its own reserves rather than going through a lengthy process to secure reimbursement from the federal government.In other areas that have drawn attention during the COVID-19 crisis, the budget proposes allowing cities and towns to count up to $114 million in money from the federal Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief, or ESSER, fund towards their required local contribution under the state's school spending formula, and includes $135 million for the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program and $26 million for the HomeBase housing assistance program.",

      "body": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker unveiled a $45.6 billion state budget Wednesday for the 2022 fiscal year beginning July 1 \u2014 a slight decline in estimated spending compared to the current fiscal year as Beacon Hill works to get the budget process back on a more predictable path following a chaotic 2020.The budget proposal has several goals, including maintaining pre-COVID-19 eligibility and benefit levels in social safety net programs while also supporting pandemic response and recovery efforts and maximizing the use of federal funds for housing, food insecurity and economic development.The spending plan also includes no tax increases for state residents and fully funds the first year of the state's new Student Opportunity Act, which requires more funds be channeled into school systems with higher percentages of low-income students and English language learners.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe raising taxes on the residents of the commonwealth especially in the midst of all that\u2019s going on is the right thing to do,\" Baker said.Baker said the spending proposal also allows Massachusetts \"to respond to the pandemic and promote our recovery, while investing in key priorities such as education, health care, substance misuse, and racial equality and diversity.\u201dThe state would make another hefty withdrawal from its rainy day fund under the proposed budget as the Massachusetts seeks to ease the financial strains imposed by the pandemic.The budget for the current fiscal year anticipates a withdrawal of about $1.35 billion and up to $1.6 billion for the new fiscal year, leaving about $1.1 billion left in the stabilization fund.That could change if Congress acts on President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, which could allow the state to draw less from the rainy day fund by instead relying on federal dollars.The proposed state budget would also increase funding for early childhood education programs, boost spending on a new congregate care network designed to achieve safety, permanency, and healthier outcomes for 2,000 children, adolescents, and young adults involved in the state Department of Children and Families, and make needed staffing and infrastructure investments at the Chelsea and Holyoke soldiers homes.Baker is also proposing doubling the budget for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency to improve the agency\u2019s readiness and enable it to do more frequent, in-depth reviews on emergency management plans, increase trainings and add staffing.The budget proposal also includes an outside section that would allow the sale of lottery products by remote methods such as debit cards in Massachusetts while maintaining the existing ban on the use of credit cards to buy lottery products.The release of the budget comes a day after Baker delivered his annual State of the Commonwealth address.During the speech, Baker said that the state\u2019s economy had been \u201chammered\u201d by the coronavirus and the state\u2019s efforts to slow the spread of the highly contagious disease.\u201cToday, we are in much better shape economically than we were last spring. But far too many people still can\u2019t find a job. Our downtowns are hurting. And many of our small businesses have been crushed by the pandemic,\u201d the Republican said during the address from his office in a nearly empty Statehouse.Democratic House Speaker Ronald Mariano tweeted Wednesday that he looking forward to reviewing Baker\u2019s budget proposal \u201cand working with him and the Senate this session on legislation that will match the scale of the current economic and public health emergencies.\u201dThe release of the governor\u2019s spending plan marks the start of the budget debate on Beacon Hill, which was interrupted last year by the coronavirus pandemic.The House and Senate will release and debate their own versions of the budget before hashing out a single compromise version that must be approved by both chambers before being sent to Baker for his signature by the start of 2021 fiscal year on July 1.",

      "body": "Gov. Charlie Baker's budget plan for the fiscal year that begins in July would spend slightly less, 0.7%, than Massachusetts is now spending. But at $45.6 billion, it's still a hefty chunk of the taxpayers' change. Here are some highlights that Beacon Hill budget-watchers have fixed on.1. Sports Betting, Again Baker's budget calls on lawmakers to legalize online sports gambling apps like DraftKings so Massachusetts can join the growing number of states placing legal bets on professional sports. Baker said neighboring states and bigger players like New Jersey have already opened up online sports books since the Supreme Court decided it was constitutional in 2018. The governor wants the state to be competitive.  \"I do think this thing is starting to mature, and I think it just makes sense to give our people the same chance to play that people have in other states,\" Baker said.Previous attempts to allow sports betting have failed. The state House of Representatives has been pushing for the new law for some time, but state senators have remained steadfast that they want a more focused legislative process before opening the door to more gambling.2. Tapping Into SavingsOctober's revised FY2021 budget used $1.3 billion from the state's \"rainy day\" stabilization savings fund to balance the books, and Baker's new proposal would use a further $1.6 billion to make ends meet. The governor's budget writers estimate that will leave the fund at a mere $1.1 billion \u2014 which Baker was quick to point out at Wednesday's budget press conference is the same balance the fund had when he took office in 2015.3. Double Funds For EmergenciesBaker wants to more than double the budget allocation for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, which coordinates the state's response to natural disasters, man-made catastrophes or just really bad snowstorms. According to Finance Secretary Mike Heffernan, raising the agency's budget from $1.9 billion to $4.2 billion would allow MEMA to be more flexible, and quicker, with resources instead of asking the Legislature for funds or waiting for federal reimbursements. File this under smart managment, the governor's team will argue.4. School FundingBaker touted an additional $246 million for local schools as the new budget's top accomplishment, saying the allocation will fund the first year of the Student Opportunity Act that rewrote the state's school funding formula but was shelved last year. Still, education funding advocates weren't happy with Baker's proposal. They called, instead, for him to retroactively fund last year's, as well as this year's, portions of the seven-year, $1.5 billion plan.The Massachusetts Teachers Association called the SOA a promise to address the structural racism of underfunding public schools.\"The governor\u2019s FY 2022 budget marks a breaking of that promise, as it moves the goal posts by pushing out the funding shortfall yet another year,\" MTA president Merrie Najimy wrote in a statement.5. There Are Proposed Cuts While Baker's budget writers said most of the spending decreases in the new budget come from lower costs at MassHealth, advocates were quick to point out some spending cuts in the document. Community activist Lew Finfer wrote in an email that Baker had cut $6.3 million from youth at risk programs and another $3.76 million from a youth jobs program.The Coalition for Homeless Individuals also found new cuts to supports for the homeless in Baker's budget.\"A $3 million, 5% budget cut jeopardizes the safety and wellness of the most vulnerable among us in addition to the frontline staff supporting them,\" coalition spokesperson Cayenne Isaksen wrote in a statement.",

      "body": "There's growing frustration over the distribution of the coronavirus vaccine in Massachusetts. One of the people calling for changes to how the state administers the vaccine is Bill Walczak, founder and former head of Dorchester's Codman Square Health Center. Walczak spoke with GBH All Things Considered host Arun Rath. This transcript has been edited for clarity.Arun Rath: You recently published an op-ed in The Dorchester Reporter pointing out that if current trends were to hold, it would take two and a half more years to get just the first dose of the vaccine in the arm of every Massachusetts resident. The state has now expanded who's eligible to get the vaccine in the next phase of the rollout that starts next week. It's just an incremental change. Run through the issues right now as you see them.Bill Walczak: The first thing you have to realize, the first thing I want to say, is that the governor and Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders came to a realization that the initial process wasn't working. So they're trying to update and change the way in which distribution happens, and that's very, very good for the state. But the other thing we have to understand is that, first of all, this is a preventable illness. COVID-19 is a preventable illness, and it's preventable by vaccine. Hundreds of thousands of people are getting COVID-19, and thousands are dying. So the most important thing is to get it out as quickly as possible. But that's an enormous undertaking, because if you just do basic math, what you find is if there's a chance of getting this thing out, the doses out by September, it's going to require over 400,000 doses in Massachusetts per week. Per week. That's an enormous undertaking, but it can be done. But what we need is the infrastructure in place. And, of course, we need the vaccine to come in. But it seems as though the federal government is going to start delivering on that. We have to be ready, and we have to make sure that we don't miss any opportunities to get that vaccine into the arms of people, so that we can cut this thing back and prevent thousands of people from getting it and thousands of people from dying. That's the basic issue. People have to understand the enormity of this, and 400,000 plus doses per week is a really big undertaking in the commonwealth of Massachusetts. Rath: If we can get the additional doses from the federal government the way that we're hearing about, what are the infrastructure issues that we would need to take on? What are the solutions that would make sense there? Walczak: What seems to work in other states is having large places to go, like what we have with Gillette and maybe with Fenway Park. But if you look at 400,000, it means that we need twelve such sites which could process 5,000 doses per day immediately, actually starting in February. That kind of infrastructure is necessary, and why it's necessary is because it's not a very efficient vaccine to put into arms, because there's a waiting process, there's timing, and then 15 minutes at the end of it. So you have to have a large area in which people can go, get in line, wait for 15 minutes afterwards, and then have a process for people that may have anaphylaxis or some other kind of problem from it, which is very rare. It's a really important that we understand that a larger type of entity can be much more efficient about getting it into arms. Not that I'm opposed to having local primary care facilities, health centers and all that doing it. No, I think that's really, really important. But what I think the state needs to do is take a look at, if epidemiologists are saying we need 80% for herd immunity, that's 80% of 6.8 million. How many doses do we need to do per week? How many do we need to get in per week? What's the likelihood of us being able to accomplish this so the kids can go to school in September and we can have a reasonable summer? Right now, it seems as though we're trying out these different processes, and we need to understand the data. You value what you measure, and we ought to be measuring these things on a weekly basis, at least, and be able to make changes as necessary to make sure that those doses get into arms as quickly as possible. Rath: Something that relates to both infrastructure and scheduling \u2014 people who are 75 and older are trying to use the state's online system to make an appointment for the vaccine and are just having a devil of a time doing it. They weren't able to get it to work. Do you have any ideas about how the sign-up process could could be streamlined? Walczak: I know that other states have call-in opportunities for people. I can tell you that one of the most frustrating things for neighbors of mine and people that I know that are over 65 or 75 is that they all know people in other states who have already gotten their vaccine. It's already happened. So other states have obviously figured out something. Part of it is \u2014 you look at, for instance, West Virginia \u2014 they have a call-in system, people know when they can get their doses, and they've been doing a really good job. We're Massachusetts. We're a great state, and we have the capacity to be able to do this. What we need to do is figure out what's working and how to get it out there quickly. We also need to understand that we need to be flexible about getting the doses out. We can't miss opportunities to get it into arms, because the more people that have it in their arms, the more likely we are to reduce dramatically the number of cases that we have and the number of deaths. Don't miss any opportunities here by being really rigid about who gets it first and who gets it second and who gets it third. Even though I agree that first responders, health care people, older people and people with morbidities should be getting it first, we can do all of that at the same time. Health centers have done that for years and years. We also understand that sometimes people don't keep their appointments, and therefore you overbook to make sure that you have enough people for your services, for your staff. Those type of things are important. The other part about being a large system is that you need the staffing, and right now we don't have the staffing necessary. We need to be able to train people very, very quickly \u2014 for instance, medical assistants, who usually don't put needles into arms. We need to train them very quickly so that we have staffing sufficient to be able to get that done. Rath: We've learned a lot, I think, in the last year about how much community health centers like Codman Square do by seeing them tested in a pandemic. Given all that community health centers are doing, can centers like Codman Square play a big part in terms of the vaccination push? How would you be able to do that? Walczak: They're all part of the solution. Health centers are part of the solution, because they have direct access to low-income people, people that are immigrants that trust the care that they're getting in the health centers. So they need to be there, and they need to do it. But they also need to be able to provide basic services too. So getting the staffing necessary into those locations is important, and that needs some central location where people can be deployed to make sure that residents in these communities that usually have difficult access or don't have cars to get places can get the kind of services that they're used to getting. But for the broader population, we need to set up these large facilities that just get it done. Rath: You mentioned the word \"trust,\" and something that we've talked about in the last year is that in some of the communities that you serve, vaccine skepticism is is high. There is distrust of the government. How are you working to win people over and to strengthen that trust?Walczak: Health centers are largely staffed by people of color and have leadership that is people of color. The person who is in charge of Codman Square Health Center, Sandra Cotterell, is an African-American who lives in Roxbury. When we have a good public relations campaign, and that's really, really important, that says, hey, look, we were part of making this thing happen. We were part of developing the vaccine. An African-American was partly responsible for having the vaccine now. We need to do a really good public relations campaign, because, yes, the African-American population in particular understands what has happened in the past to them by research that's been done, Tuskegee being the most famous. But nonetheless, we do have a significant number of people in our African-American, Latino and other communities that are part of the health care system that are getting these vaccines. People need to understand that no, this is not something being foisted on them. This is something that's really part of your community and part of making your community safer. I think people will listen to that, but we just need to do a much better job of our public relations and getting that information out there and letting people see that this is not something that's being foisted on them. It's something that's really part of protecting our communities and making them safe.",

      "body": "William Gross is stepping down as Boston Police Commissioner, Mayor Walsh's office announced Thursday.Walsh said in a statement Thursday that Gross is retiring from the department and that he is appointing Dennis White as Gross' replacement. Gross led the Boston Police Department for the last two and a half years and was the first African American to hold the position. He served in the department for 37 years.\"Throughout his decorated career, he's always embodied the spirit of community policing that is so important to building trust with the people we serve,\" said Mayor Walsh in a statement. \"We can all be proud of the legacy he'll leave behind, from reducing major crime to helping undertake the most ambitious set of police reforms in the department's history.\"Gross  thanked the department and said in the statement that he decided to retire \u201conly after long and careful consideration.\u201d\u201cMy heart will always remain alongside my brothers and sisters of the BPD,\u201d he continued. \u201cI will continue to be one of their biggest champions as I move forward with my next chapter.\" Walsh tapped Gross \u2014 who began his tenure with the BPD as a street cop in 1985 \u2014 to lead the department in 2018. At the time of his appointment, Gross commented on its significance in a city with a long history of racism.\u201cIt shows that any kid in Boston that they will have the opportunity to be mayor or commissioner or chief, if we all work together,\u201d Gross said at a July 2018 news conference. \u201cIf you want change, be change. That\u2019s why I became a police officer.\u201dEd Gaskin, executive director of Grove Hall Main Streets, said he was a fan of Gross. Gaskin described him as a steady and fair law enforcement leader, particularly when it came to understanding the concerns of business owners and criminal justice reformers who held opposing view points over District Attorney Rachael Rollins' controversial decision to shift resources away from prosecuting low-level offenses like shoplifting.Activist Jamarhl Crawford said while Gross\u2019 tenure was historic, parts of his record are problematic. He cited Gross' criticism of judges who released repeat offenders, his willingness to meet Trump-era Attorney General William Barr, and his praise of officers who appeared to use excessive force the night that peaceful protests broke down into unrest and looting last summer. \u201cI can\u2019t say that I saw any sea change in quality of life for communities of color, specifically the Black community,\u201d said Crawford, a member of the police reform task force that recommended greater oversight and accountability of the BPD.The announcement fueled speculation among some who closely follow Boston politics that Gross will soon announce a run for mayor, potentially joining an already crowded field of candidates vying to replace Walsh. Boston City Councilors Michelle Wu, Andrea Campbell and, most recently, Annissa Essaibi George have all officially jumped into the race. President Biden has nominated Walsh to his cabinet as labor secretary.About two weeks ago, Gross said he was thinking about running for mayor.\"Out of respect, I sure am considering every thought and every prayer that comes my way, that people want me to be a mayoral candidate \u2014 deep consideration,\" Gross told WCVB.GBH News reached out to the Boston Police Department to ask about Gross' future plans, but a spokeswoman for the department was unable to provide any details.White, who currently serves as superintendent in the department and chief of staff to Gross, will lead the BPD beginning Friday and will become the second Black commissioner. \"I want to thank Mayor Walsh for entrusting me with this incredible opportunity and the responsibility of leading our historic department,\u201d White said in a statement. \u201cServing as Commissioner is the honor of a lifetime, and I will never take this sacred duty for granted.\"Reporter Saraya Wintersmith contributed to this article.",

      "body": "In an early-January interview with NPR, now Vice President Kamala Harris addressed how the new Biden administration planed to juggle its numerous priorities as they got underway.\"We know how to multitask,\" she said, chuckling. \"There\u2019s a reason that word exists in the English language.\"That turn of phrase got us here at GBH's Curiosity Desk wondering what is the reason that word found its way into the English language, and whether its origins might hold some clues as to how we might better operate in an age of countless demands and distractions. \"We adopt new words when we need new words; that is to say, when we have new things to describe,\" said Peter Sokolowski, editor-at-large for Springfield-based Merriam-Webster dictionary.In the case of the word multitasking, that need arose not all that long ago \u2014 at the dawn of the digital age. \"Multitasking [is] from the mid-1960s meaning, the concurrent performance of several jobs by a computer,\" said Sokolowski. \"So, the fact is it started with computers and kind of loosened and became figurative, as so many words do.\"There are numerous examples of this. The new steam-powered engines of the mid-1800's gave us the term \"full steam ahead,\" which once referred to a very specific function of those engines. Factories powered by complex and novel machines gave us the word \"downtime\" in the 1940s, which once referred specifically to periods between shifts when the machinery would be powered down, but now more commonly describes those brief, relaxing moments between Zoom meetings. As for the word multitasking \u2014 even in its original, literal sense \u2014 it's something of a misnomer, said computer engineer and Boston University Professor Roscoe Giles.\"[Multitasking] amounts, in layman\u2019s terms, to the computer working on more than one task \u2014 seemingly \u2014 at the same time. Seemingly. Computer processors can actually only do one thing at a time. They just do those things imperceptibly fast. So while your computer is, for example, streaming audio, downloading emails and calculating a spreadsheet without missing a beat, its multitasking processors are actually bouncing back and forth among all three jobs.\"It\u2019s moving blindingly quickly between tasks,\" said Giles. \"From a few steps on this task to a few steps on that task to a few steps on another.\"It turns out, that\u2019s a pretty apt description of what we do when we multitask, said MIT neuroscientist Earl Miller. \"You can only think of a very small bit of information, one train of thought at a time,\" he explained. \"So when you think you\u2019re multitasking, what you\u2019re actually doing is task switching. You\u2019re switching back and forth.\"But there is a critical difference between a computer and the human brain. By switching among tasks, a computer is able to find efficiencies \u2014 and operate faster. But when it comes to you and me, Miller said study after study has shown the opposite. \"The result is you have decreased productivity, increased mistakes, and a decrease of quality of thought,\" he said.Miller said that goes for any combination of tasks that requires conscious attention, like texting and driving or monitoring emails while you are in a meeting. Miller said that the brain is simply not built to multitask and that nobody is actually good at it, though some are slightly better at it than others. And if you think you are among the better few, Miller has some bad news for you. \"It turns out there\u2019s an inverse correlation,\" he said. \"People who think they\u2019re better at multitasking are actually worse at it.\"As for why, Miller said it comes down to something the brain is quite skilled at.\"Their brain rationalizes it,\" he said. \"[They] delude themselves into thinking they are good at doing something that they\u2019re not because they\u2019re making an excuse for why they do it. And if there is one thing we\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s that the brain is very good at deluding itself.\"Despite the fact that our brains aren't designed to multitask, Miller said fighting the compulsion to so is actually difficult. The brain is also hard-wired to constantly crave new information. And given the demands of modern life and the host of things clamoring for our attention, the impulse to multitask is ever-present. Still, Miller said we should do all we can to resist the urge.\"It\u2019s too hard to focus on one thing at a time by sheer will power alone. You have to plan to focus, you have to remove distractions,\" he said. \"And one great thing about the brain is your brain learns with experience. Your brain is like a muscle; the more you practice things the better it gets. There\u2019s a word Miller uses for that kind of mindful focus: monotasking. That\u2019s a term so new it has yet to find it's way into Merriam-Webster's dictionary. Still the concept is an old one. Much older than the computer. ",

Starting next week, the site plans to be vaccinating upwards of 1,500 people each day, to start. Rachel Wilson is the COO of CIC Health, which operates the Fenway Park site and the state's first mass vaccination operation at Gillette Stadium. According to Wilson, Gillette is currently vaccinating roughly 2,000 people per day with a future goal to vaccinate 5,000 each day.Wilson says these places provide more than just the space for a socially distant roll-out.\"What we're trying to do is to create confidence and excitement and engagement and energy around getting vaccinated because this is really how we get back to our new normal lives,\" said Wilson. \"And so these venues are powerful not just for the feeling they bring while you're there but also for the feeling you create in others to help them get vaccinated when it's their turn.\"Dave McGillivray is the owner of DMSE Sports and the longtime race director of the Boston Marathon. Now, he and his company are part of the operations for both sites. He says working with both sites has not only saved his business, but gave him a sense of purpose during this tough time.\"It starts with hope and that's what we're creating right now with all these people is hope that this is gonna go away and our lives are gonna get back to normal,\" said McGillivray. We also heard from Marty Martinez, Boston's Chief of Health and Human Services, about how the city is bridging the digital divide in their vaccine distribution, particularly as it starts to ramp up another mass vaccination site at the Reggie Lewis Track and Field Center in Roxbury.Click on the audio player above to listen to the full episode.Segments:Marty Martinez - 1:52Rachel Wilson and Dave McGillivray - 14:18",

Residents over age 75 will be eligible for doses beginning Monday, but many say they've spent hours unsuccessfully trying to secure an appointment since the state website began accepting reservations at 12 a.m. Wednesday.\"It's terrible. It's broken. It doesn't work,\" said state Sen. Pat Jehlen, D-Middlesex, who chairs the Joint Committee on Elder Affairs. Jehlen, who is over age 75 herself, said she's been unable to get a vaccine appointment through the online system.State Sen. Eric Lesser, D-First Hampden and Hampshire, introduced a bill Thursday that would require the state Department of Public Health to set up a hotline and a \"one-stop\" website for registration. The current system redirects users to other provider websites to sign up. Lesser said he has a lot of questions about Baker's pending hotline announcement.\"We don't know the details,\" Lesser said. \"Does that mean that there's an announcement next week, and that a call center will open after that? Or next week the call center becomes operational? We need a lot more details ... We want to see, will that call center be 24/7? Will it be in multiple languages? Will it be able to schedule appointments with a live person and answer questions that people might have about vaccine access? Those are all going to be key elements to figuring out whether this is actually going to help solve the problem.\"Even if the phone hotline meets those requirements, Lesser said, the web sign-up needs to be simplified and translated into multiple languages.\"For the vaccine to be effective, we need it to reach every community in the state, including communities that are historically under-served by healthcare and who have had some skepticism about the vaccine, given the history of health disparities both in our state and nationally,\" Lesser said. \"So this is very, very important.\"\"There needs to be a central place, so you don't have to go to 15 different websites to find out if there are appointments and how to make them,\"  Jehlen said. Baker said Thursday that the system only allows people to book an appointment within a week because the federal government doesn't inform the state beyond that period of how much vaccine will be on hand. Baker said new appointments will be opened up each Thursday.\"If it was centralized, then I wouldn't have to every Thursday go and look and see if there was something at 12:01 and compete with other people on searching,\" Jehlen said. \"This should not be 'Hunger Games.' This should be an organized plan.\" Jehlen said with a centralized system, people would be able to fill out a sign-up form then get notified later when a vaccine dose is available at a site near them.State Sen. Harriette Chandler, D-Worcester, who co-sponsored the bill that Lesser introduced, said she was grateful to hear Baker say a phone hotline is in the works.\"I'm glad that he's listened, and it's a start,\" Chandler said. Even with that upcoming announcement, she said, the legislation may still be necessary.\"I always believe that you don't remove legislation until you're sure it's not needed,\" Chandler said. \"I have every reason for confidence in what the governor is trying to do. I think he's working hard, and I think his people are working hard. But I think we need to see whether it works or not. And the only way we can do that is to give it a chance.\"",

Boston University, Northeastern, Tufts, UMass, Salem State and Harvard are already operating as vaccine distribution centers, and the state has approved about a dozen more colleges to administer vaccines. Students, faculty and staff just returning to campuses are relatively low on the priority list for the shots in Massachusetts. \u201cI don't think we should really be sending any staff member into a classroom until they're vaccinated,\u201d said epidemiologist Michael Siegel, who teaches at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health. Siegal thinks BU, which has been helping to distribute the vaccine to health care and frontline workers, got lucky last semester \u2014 a surge of cases on campus never happened. Not all public health specialists agree.\u201cI don't think there's an urgent need to necessarily immunize faculty and students,\u201d said infectious disease specialist David Hamer, who also teaches global health and medicine at BU. Hamer is part of the university\u2019s medical advisory group, which has been trying to reduce the spread at New England\u2019s largest private university.\u201cWe had no evidence of classroom transmission of the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we continue the same measures in the spring, which we\u2019re planning, the risk for faculty members of being exposed through teaching and through student contact is very, very low.\u201dDespite analysis suggesting colleges that opened in the fall increased COVID cases in their home counties, Hamer said testing and isolating infected students, faculty and staff at BU largely worked in the fall.  Still, Hamer agrees with Siegel that BU might have gotten lucky. \u201cIf you think we dodged a bullet last time, now we have to dodge machine gun fire, because we're starting out with a large amount of virus circulating across the country,\u201d he said.To hear the full story, click on the audio player above.",

She officially jumped into the race Thursday morning, joining fellow city councilors Michelle Wu and Andrea Campbell, both of whom announced they were running last fall. She is the first person to commit to running since President Joe Biden nominated Mayor Marty Walsh to his cabinet earlier this month.As a city councilor, she said, she has advocated for improved special education, vocational and technical education, and mental health services for students, adding that the city needs \"a greater sense of urgency\" around the city's schools.She urged a prompt return to in-person learning for Boston students, while acknowledging the district needs to take a measured approach.\"As a parent, it can't happen quick enough,\" she said. \"But as an elected official, as a leader of this city, as someone who wants to be mayor, we do have to move just slow enough so that we can watch the impacts of reopening schools.\"Essaibi George also discussed the economic challenges ahead for Boston, as it faces a balancing act between keeping the community safe and protecting businesses in the city. While she praised Walsh and other leaders for acting as they did in the face of an unprecedented crisis, she said there were missteps along the way.\"We've certainly laid the burden of this crisis on the doorstep of our locally-owned businesses, and it has been devastating to too many businesses, too many industries,\" she said, specifically citing gyms and fitness centers. \"I think we did put too tight of a restriction on many of those businesses.\"\"I'm really concerned about those businesses that will not make it to recovery,\" she continued, \"and what are the steps we need to take as municipal government and state government for sure, to support those businesses so they don't collapse before we get to a place where we can say we've taken control of this virus, we can now discuss recovery.\"Essaibi George's mother was born to Polish parents in a displaced persons camp in Germany. Her father immigrated to the United States from Tunisia in 1972.She said her father once told her \"no girl with an Arab name \u2014 Annissa Essaibi \u2014 will ever run or win anything in this city.\"\"A small part of me wants to prove my father wrong,\" she said. \"Boston has changed, but there's still so much work to do.\"",

      "body": "This story is part two in our higher ed series The Spring Semester Divide. You can read and listen to part one here.As he was preparing to hit send on a carefully-crafted email in October inviting all students back to campus for the spring semester, the president of Holy Cross College in Worcester said he prayed \u2014 a lot.\u201cBefore, during, after, every day, every midday,\u201d the Rev. Philip Boroughs said, laughing. \u201cThere's so many unpredictables in this pandemic, and you want something definitive, but you live in a world of uncertainty.\u201dOn a recent snowy afternoon, the Jesuit priest, wearing a white collar and a black mask, stood inside the empty campus center overlooking downtown Worcester \u2014 a COVID-19 hot spot. Boroughs said he decided to take the risk of re-opening, in part, because traditionally 90% of the Catholic college\u2019s students live on the hilltop campus and for most of 2020 missed being a community.\u201cInteracting together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe friendships that are formed that last a lifetime. These are so characteristic of who we are and the level and quality of our education, which is small classes. That sense of being a community, that's critical to what we do.\u201d In shifting from online to in-person learning, Holy Cross is in the minority but far from alone in Massachusetts. At least eight colleges, including Smith and Berklee, that were online in the fall are going in-person or hybrid in the spring. Across the country, nearly 200 colleges are making the switch, Oberlin in Ohio and Valencia in Florida among them. Another 200 are delaying in-person starts but intend to transition to in-person later in the semester.Higher education researchers say they are deeply skeptical.\u201cWe have as many deaths as there were in World War II, and yet institutions are still planning on re-opening,\u201d said Chris Marsicano, who directs the College Crisis Initiative at Davidson College in North Carolina. Since March, the center has been tracking colleges' COVID-19 plans. \u201cIt is miraculous to me that institutions that were so concerned with the number of cases and hospitalizations and deaths in August seem less concerned now,\u201d he said.Marsicano said colleges changing course this semester fall into two categories. The first includes Holy Cross, which in January received a $23.5 million gift from Agnes Williams, the late widow of Edward Bennett Williams, the former owner of the Washington Redskins and Baltimore Orioles.\u201cThe sort of Ivy-plus institutions of the world that have large endowments per student and have the ability to test every student [for COVID-19] at least once or twice a week,\u201d Marsicano explained.The other group depends on dorm and meal charges just to keep their doors open and their lights on.\u201cLosing that room and board revenue for one semester is painful,\u201d Marsicano said. \u201cLosing that revenue for two semesters or three semesters is an existential problem for many of these institutions.\u201dThat\u2019s why, Marsicano suspects, less selective schools like Becker College also in Worcester, Dean College in Franklin and Regis College in Weston are moving to in-person classes. But college leaders dismiss that notion, arguing little transmission of the coronavirus from students to professors or students to students has occurred. While researchers say some campuses were superspreaders in their home counties, they disagree about the level of risk. \u201cFall semester went quite well,\u201d said Rich Doherty, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Massachusetts. Doherty insisted reopening is not about revenue and, since March, colleges have shared best practices about testing and limiting the number of students in dorms and dining halls. He said those schools bringing students back this semester have done careful, thoughtful preparation. At Holy Cross, that means testing students, faculty and staff twice a week and allowing professors to decide whether they want to teach in-person or online. Ed O\u2019Donnell, chair of the school's history department, said he\u2019s the only instructor who has opted in so far.\u201cWe all prize the in-person experience,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell, who has experience teaching online and for mass audiences like One Day University. \u201cBut I've just felt the college has taken enough steps to make things safe.\u201d Holy Cross is also spreading students out in dorms and dining halls and requiring everyone to wear a mask. On the day GBH News visited campus, all students appeared to be complying as they were trickling back to campus and moving.\u201cThere's definitely going to be people who aren't going to be the safest. That's just the reality of the fact,\u201d said senior Emma Flanagan, 21, from Braintree, who, like many undergrads, is excited to be back on the hill. Last semester, she rented an apartment downtown, took her classes online and came to campus once a week to use the library and see friends.Flanagan said it's \u201cembarrassing to say that your library is your social time, but you\u2019d see one random person that you hadn\u2019t seen in a while and end up talking to them for thirty minutes.\"Boroughs acknowledged the reopened campus won't be risk-free.\u201cI really think everyone wants to be back in the face-to-face environment,\u201d he said, overlooking wary faculty members. \u201cNow we have these new strains that are very difficult, so we\u2019re not going to have a semester without cases.\"The college has leased hotel rooms downtown and created isolation and quarantine spaces on campus.GBH\u2019s Diane Adame contributed to this report.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Amherst College was online last semester. The college offered in-person classes in the fall.",

People with afternoon appointments were asked show up in the morning.The Gillette Stadium site opened, but anyone with an appointment scheduled after 3 p.m. will receive an email to reschedule for later this week.\u201cIn case of closures due to winter weather, vaccination locations will reach out to individuals with appointments to reschedule,\u201d the state said in a statement. \u201cIf you cannot safely get to your appointment, you can reschedule.\u201d",

Gross was the first.White also acknowledged that in Boston, police-community relations have been strained over the past year.\"As commissioner, the Boston Police Department will continue to prioritize community engagement to build trust and relationships with our citizens and community,\" he said. \"We will get through this together. But we will have to make changes.\"After swearing in White, Walsh spoke about the storm that\u2019s expected to hit eastern Massachusetts hard beginning Monday afternoon, urging residents and commuters to avoid driving.\u201cBoston could get between 12 to 18 inches of snow, wind gusts could be as high as 45 to 50 miles per hour, [and] temperatures are going to be on the milder side with heavy and wet snow, which makes traveling very difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI encourage everyone to stay off the roads, if at all possible, from pretty much right now until tomorrow,\u201d Walsh added.A snow emergency goes into effect in Boston at noon Monday, which means parking is forbidden on main roads with snow-emergency restrictions.The storm comes as Boston loosens some restrictions and moves back to Phase III, Step 1 of the state\u2019s COVID reopening plan.Walsh urged Bostonians to continue taking steps to limit the virus\u2019s spread, noting that Monday also marks the one-year anniversary of Boston\u2019s first confirmed COVID case.\u201cNone of us had any idea what to expect a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic has turned our city and our world upside down. \u2026 Especially, it\u2019s hard for communities who \u2026 already faced the deepest historic disparities in health and economic outcomes.However, Walsh added, the city is slowly reopening as key COVID metrics improve; vaccination programs are expanding; and the Biden Administration is taking the pandemic seriously in a way the Trump Administration didn\u2019t. \u201cWe have begun the process of healing, and we\u2019re going to get through this together,\u201d he said.

Charlie Baker says Massachusetts is well-prepared for the major snow storm that will hit the state Monday and Tuesday and that aside from some postponed appointments, the rollout of the state's COVID-19 vaccination plan won't be harmed.\"This is obviously our second major storm of the season. We're used to dealing with snow this time of year, but it's important for folks to take this one seriously due to the heavy snowfall, the high winds and the speed with which a lot of this snow is going to fall when it starts to come down,\" Baker said.The governor said providers who have closed their doors for the storm will contact patients with appointments to reschedule them.\"I think the big goal for the mass [vaccination] sites is going to be to try to get as many of the folks who are scheduled today through, and they've been talking to people all morning about that. And folks who either are nervous about traveling in, given the storm and all the rest, they will do what they can to get them rescheduled this week,\" Baker said.Despite the storm, Massachusetts residents over the age of 75 were still able start receiving vaccines on Monday. Dozens lined up at Fenway Park to start the vaccination process, many coming in early to beat the snow.\"Those that had an appointment here at Fenway Park in the afternoon, we asked them to come if possible in the morning, and many of them did, so we can get as many people through before the snow comes,\u201d said Rodrigo Martinez, chief market officer with CIC Health, the organization running vaccination sites at Fenway and Gillette Stadium.Asked if the storm could disrupt distribution of vaccine doses to sites, Baker said most sites have already received their allotment of shots for the week and he doesn't expect supplies to be disrupted.While activating it's usual snow-fighting operation, MassDOT will coordinate with vaccination sites to remove snow from entrances and parking lots to maintain access to the sites.Most of the MBTA is operating on a normal weekday schedule.Baker said the state's vaccine appointment website, which has received criticism for linking out to individual vaccination sites' own appointment booking pages, has received some adjustments, like the ability to search within a general geographic area instead of individual sites. \"We cleaned up a number of the other elements and it makes it easier for people to actually just walk through whether or not, in fact, they're eligible to get vaccines at this point with a series of questions on the front end,\" Baker said. The governor said his team has been looking at how other states operate similar web portals and are going to incorporate best practises into Massachusetts'.Baker said the impact of the storm will be different throughout the state. The governor said western and northern central Massachusetts could see large amounts of lighter snow while coastal areas will deal with less volume but a much heavier snowfall. High winds and potential power outages along the coast are also a concern, Baker said.Baker said that since most commuters are already working remotely, MassDOT and local snow managers don't have to worry about a large crowd leaving the Boston area in the afternoon and crowding roads just as the storm picks up.Reporter Craig LeMoult contributed to this story.",

He urged drivers to stay off the road as much as possible starting mid-afternoon Monday.The storm could also bring with high winds with gusts of up to 55 miles per hour along the coast and the possibility of moderate coastal flooding, accordinf to Baker.Boston Mayor Marty Walsh also urged residents and commuters to avoid driving in the city.\u201cI encourage everyone to stay off the roads, if at all possible, from pretty much right now until tomorrow,\u201d Walsh said.The National Weather Service echoed Walsh's warning, saying in a winter storm warning that \"travel could be very difficult to impossible.\"A snow emergency went into effect in Boston at noon Monday, which means parking is forbidden on main roads with snow-emergency restrictions.

      "body": "New year; new beginnings. For our first Mass Mix of 2021, we asked our contributors to reflect on the meaning of a new year and tell us what they've been listening to on repeat. Here's what they said.Squirrel Flower - Explain It To Me [OFFICIAL AUDIO]Squirrel Flower, \u201cExplain It To Me\"Squirrel Flower has blossomed into a standout vocalist in the Boston music scene. Featuring her trademark poetic, earthy melodies and smooth harmonizations, Squirrel Flower appropriately closes 2020 with her latest release, an ethereal cover of Liz Phair's 1993 sleeper hit, Explain It To Me. It's a ghostly, melancholic reflection on leaving places, people, and memories from the past behind and moving on to more positive experiences. It's a poignant song, lyrically and sonically \u2014 but with Squirrel Flower's calming tone, she strings together such a breathtaking look at letting go that you can't help but feel optimistic about the days to come. -Lex den Boggende, Staff Writer, Sound of BostonWatch Front Row Boston's Squirrel Flower Live At The Decordova Sculpture Park And MuseumGroove With MeHighKeyRandom, \"Groove With Me\"In a year that rewired our brains to fear the sight of others, nostalgic party-banger, \"Groove With Me\" will help you recall the feeling of celebrating a care-free Saturday night with friends. Boston-based rapper, HighKeyRandom, incorporates high-energy trap beats over warm, celebratory synths; and laid back rhymes that ride the beat like a wave. HighKeyRandom hits \"get-down-with-your-bad-self\" notes as he raps and sings joyful lines like, \"when I walk into the party, it's a groove!\" Check out the track on his new album, The Gentle Savage, to envision yourself in a future where life is social and vibrant once again. -Jared Steinberg, Staff Writer, Sound of BostonTigers Jaw - Hesitation (Official Music Video)Tigers Jaw, \"Hesitation\"It's a new year. But it still feels like the old year. And it's probably going to feel like the old year for a little while. And that's OK. Let's take this opportunity to find the balance in between. To both look ahead and lean back, simultaneously. I'm looking ahead to March, when a band that I love leaning back into \u2014 Scranton, PA's Tigers Jaw \u2014 will release a new full-length, I Won't Care How You Remember Me. The lead single, \"Hesitation,\" captures the zeitgeist not only in its title but in its lyrics: \"Strip away the paint and begin and begin again.\" And it's done with all the angst and aplomb Tigers Jaw has come to be known for over the last 15 years. We're moving forward. Cautiously. And hopefully. -Adam 12, Weekdays 11a-4p, ROCK 92.9Perfume Genius - \"Your Body Changes Everything\" (Boy Harsher Remix)Perfume Genius, \"Your Body Changes Everything\" (Boy Harsher Remix)If dark, brooding dance music is your thing, then Boy Harsher has got you covered. They remix a Perfume Genius song for this track, which is as unexpected as it is well-executed. To be truthful, I thought 2020's album by Perfume Genius 'SET MY HEART ON FIRE IMMEDIATELY' was ''meh.'' If the reader has paid attention to my writings through the Hassle over the past few years, you know how much I stan Michael Hadreas. So, the remix of this song has resuscitated my many-a-years long interest in Hadreas' catalog. If the listener may recall, Jae & Augustus also remixed a Urochromes track, which, of all of the Urochromes releases, I just gobble up \u2014 but Boy Harsher'sHarsher's remixes of Night Bully \u2014 muah. I highly recommend all three of these artists if you have not checked them out already. This song represents new beginnings because remixes prove that you can always remix past experiences into something positive and something new. -Chris Hues, Associate Editor of bostonhassle.comRaw HtmlTiberius, \"Pale Ale\"Watch Allston indie rocker Tiberius careen from moody drone to ecstatic, scream-your-lungs-out choruses. Watch them inquire about the future in a time of lost futures: \"What if I moved to the city? / What if I moved down the street? / Would you have me over for toast and tea?\" they ask some implied beau(x). Watch Brendan Wright, the band's brainchild, make a song sound as loud, sonically, as it is at times quiet and brooding. Watch Tiberius hope, remember, nostalgize. Listen to Tiberius remind us in the absence of social interaction and the lull of life that the light at the end of the tunnel is a house show. -N. Malte Collins, Editor, Sound of BostonRaw HtmlRed Amandala, \"antennas//earl Sweatshirt\" After listening to \"antennas//earl Sweatshirt,\" it comes as no surprise that Tariq Charles, who goes by the moniker Red Amandala, was a finalist for Boston's Youth Poet Laureate. There's a feel of ease in the flow, like Red Amandala's feet are kicked up on a big wooden desk, leaning back while recounting success: \"I push facts. I did that / I pen tracks, I wrist that / The air crisp. I taste that / A fair risk, I take that.\" Perhaps it's most appropriate to compare \"antennas//earl Sweatshirt\" to the artist it name drops: Earl Sweatshirt. The title's format is a potential ode to \"AM // Radio,\" and the song shares a similar feel. But it also shares a melancholy like Mac Miller's posthumous record, a nonchalance like Action Bronson, and a soft analog beat reminiscent of Knxlwedge. The instrumentation is looped throughout the song, allowing the listener to set their focus on what deserves it most: Red Amandala's lyrics. -Knar Bedian, Editor in Chief, Sound of Boston Julien Baker - \"Hardline\" (Official Music Video)Julien Baker, \"Hardline\"I\u2019ve never found a song that reflects my own present emotional experience down to the precise second the way this song does, and it knocks the wind out of me. I feel as if it is a gift from Baker; she is holding my hand as I toddle through these first days of 2021 with fear and a maddening uncertainty, trying to find a sweetness in the infected winter. \u201cHardline\u201d is the second single released off of Baker\u2019s forthcoming album, Little Oblivions, due out February 26 on Matador Records. -Ashley Kreutter, Music Section Manager & Editor, Boston HassleKaiti Jones - Gettin Around To It (Official Music Video)Kaiti Jones, \"Gettin Around To It\"I exhaled BIG when I heard this. It's validation for everyone who's forgotten to call this week or this month; for everyone who wrote chapter one of a great novel and gave up, everyone trying hard to get started again! Kaiti Jones (no relation) waited nearly four years before new songs were ready to be released, writing from her home in Cambridge. \"Gettin Around to It\" is one that sounds like it came to mind one afternoon; it's urgent, tightly-written, and a little off-kilter. The whacky meter-shifts suggest a distracted but persevering mind. Acknowledgment is due to the Novel Ideas' local Dan Radin for extraordinary harmony vocals and co-producing Jones' new album Tossed. Look for it on March 5, and in the meantime, go easy on yourself! -Phil Jones, Afternoon Host, 88.9 WERSHailey Whitters - Fillin\u2019 My Cup feat. Little Big Town (Official Music Video)Hailey Whitters, \"Fillin\u2019 My Cup\" feat. Little Big TownI'm not usually a big country music fan, but something about 2021 has me searching for music I usually don't listen to. When I saw that Little Big Town teamed up with Haily Whitters, I took a listen and realized that an upbeat country song is the exact energy I need as we start this year. It's not breaking any barriers, but I like the tribute to how life can be unpredicatble: \"One part happy/One part chaos/Whole lot of borrowed/Little bit of paid off.\" I saw Little Big Town perform live way back when, and they struck me as a country band for someone who doesn't really listen to country music, and I loved how they centered female voices. -Meghan Smith, Digital Producer, GBHRaw Html",

      "body": "On Thursday, the city of Chelsea is set to open its own coronavirus vaccination center at the headquarters of the Chelsea Collaborative.The East Boston Neighborhood Health Center will operate the new vaccination site. Appointments can be made online and over the phone starting Tuesday morning. The center will initially be limiting access to Chelsea residents only, starting with those 75 years and older.The location of the center is in the recently rebuilt headquarters of the Chelsea Collaborative, a nonprofit community organization located at 318 Broadway in Chelsea. According to Gladys Vega, executive director for the Collaborative, the headquarters were in desperate need of repair after the organization turned its offices into a food pantry in the spring. She says a city painters and carpenters union updated the space pro bono.\"At the peak of the pandemic, we fed our community,\" Vega said. \"And then, almost a year after, we're giving the vaccinations in order for us to begin to see the end of this pandemic. That way, we can begin to have a normal life and our community members can be cured.\"Vega said she and Collaborative staff have been strongly advocating for a vaccination center in Chelsea, where roughly 80% of residents are service workers.We also heard from Dr. Richard Ellison, an infectious disease specialist at UMass Memorial Health Care, about the coronavirus variants making headlines and what they mean for vaccines on the market right now.Click on the audio player above to listen to the full episode.Segments:Gladys Vega - 2:38Dr. Richard Ellison - 18:40",

But plenty of frustrated residents can't get an appointment. Jodi Scarbrough tried unsuccessfully for days to sign her in-laws up for the shots before finally securing a slot just before she joined Jim Braude, along with state Sen. Julian Cyr, D-Cape and Islands, who has expressed frustration at the state\u2019s rollout.",
