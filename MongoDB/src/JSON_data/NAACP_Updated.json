      "body": "FULL TEXT Here is a sample of business stories the Banner covered this year. Food, drink and entertainment Someone, somewhere will always need, want and love food and beverages, and it's no surprise that a number of local entrepreneurs have chosen to turn their food-related skills into a business. Dorchester native and avid baker Teresa Maynard left a full-time job to follow her passion with Sweet Teez bakery in 2016 and garnered accolades in 2017 at the Boston Food and Wine Expo and the New England Dessert Showcase. Schoolteacher and entrepreneur Cassandra Morgan celebrated the first year of Dudley's Seafood Market, which she launched after spending time soaking up knowledge from the experts at Boston Fish Pier. Attorney Bev Armstrong left the biotechnology industry to turn her hobby of craft beer brewing into Brazo Fuerte Artisanal Beer. Savvor Lounge, opened by Eddie Firmin in 2014, continued to offer Caribbean-Southern soul food along with music and dancing downtown, while longstanding Slade's in Lower Roxbury changed ownership and is now in the hands of Darryl Settles and Teryl Calloway. In Dudley Square's Bolling Building, Dudley Dough said farewell as 2017 drew to a close, but several new restaurants are in the works there, including a yet-to-be-announced new venture in the building's long-empty flagship space. In Cambridge, Dennis Benzan and Hector and Nivia Pina, the team behind Vejigantes, Merengue and Do\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u2013\u2019a Habana, opened La F\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b1brica in February, adding Spanish-Caribbean food and jazz to Central Square. Health and beauty Some local entrepreneurs cater to those on a path toward better health and well-being, from body building to skin care. Joe Sumrell and his team specialize in building strong bodies and winning attitudes at Inside Out Fitness Concepts. Handcrafted organic and natural products are the specialty of Faithlyn Scarlett, founder of Faith's Naturals in Jamaica Plain, and Bernette Dawson, whose Made Organics products can be purchased online and at pop-up markets. Professional services While a number of the businesses we covered are retail and food businesses, others provide services. Bobin Nicholson, owner of Eye & Eye Optics, capitalized on two decades of experience as an optician and supervisor at HarvardVanguard when he went into business for himself in 2010. Zamawa Arenas launched her branding and marketing consultancy Flowetik this year after 20 years with a full-service marketing firm. Kristen Ransom emphasizes inclusion and diversity at IncluDe, the software design and development agency she started in 2016. Building and fixing For McCoy Fence Company, 2018 will mark 30 years in business for founder Ralph McCoy, whose daughters now are integral parts of the operation. Domingos DaRosa represents a newer generation, serving customers across EasternMassachusetts with DaRosa Property Maintenance LLC, the property maintenance and repair business he founded in 2015. Businesses giving back Some entrepreneurs place special emphasis on assisting other small businesses and nonprofits or helping to lift others in the community. Outside the Box Agency founder Justin Springer helps nonprofits get their messages out with creative digital storytelling. Abeeku Barrow, founder of Boston Cleaning Services, is creating jobs for local teens. And Kai and Chris Grant provide a venue for local entrepreneurs to sell their wares at Black Market, which opened in Dudley Square in June and is poised to expand in 2018. Support for the risk-takers While some navigate the new territory of business ownership on their own, many entrepreneurs we spoke with credited their success in part to accelerator and incubator programs and other initiatives to help launch and grow businesses. The City of Boston's Office of Small Business Development in June launched a series of small business workshops in city neighborhoods, starting with Mattapan. Mass Innovation Nights put the spotlight on tech entrepreneurs of color at a networking and business showcase event in Grove Hall. Cohorts of food entrepreneurs learned the basics in Food Biz 101, a training program cosponsored by Commonwealth Kitchen and Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, while Santander Bank began its \"Cultivate Small Business\" initiative, also targeting food entrepreneurs. Eastern Bank's new Business Equity Initiative, led by Glynn Lloyd, offers capacity-building loans and technical assistance to existing black- and Latino-owned businesses. And the Boston Ujima Project launched formally with an aim to build a new community-controlled economy in Boston's neighborhoods of color.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Britt's education program, teaching black history through the lens of black dolls, spread like wildfire. The dolls became a narrative and physical resource with which to teach history. Britt gives the example of a Topsy-Turvy doll, a two-faced creation made by enslaved mothers with one black side and one white side. Britt says, \"Dolls are an art form. They tell a story based on the materials they used, the fabric, the colors.\" In 2012 she secured a contract with the public school system to create and present educational programming. As the business continued to grow, she secured a physical space in Mansfield to store and sort through the dolls. That space, at 288 N. Main St., now serves as the Black Doll Museum, open to the public. The museum is a family owned and operated 501(c)(3) nonprofit and run as a volunteer effort. Donations are accepted through their website, www.nbdmhc.org, to keep the institution running. Britt grew up on Harlem Street in Dorchester and lived there for 40 years. Her experiences with racism in schools sparked her desire not only to bring black history to school-aged children, but to serve as a resource for them. \"It's important to let black kids know that they can do anything,\" she says. \"They can't quite see the future and it's scary.\" In February, the museum will feature a black college exhibition titled \"Endless Possibilities,\" with dolls and stories of historically black colleges and The Divine Nine fraternities and sororities. It is also currently accepting submissions for a Martin Luther King Jr. student art show scheduled to exhibit at the museum in January. In addition, Britt hopes to create walking tours with the Black History Trail in Mansfield. She reports that most of the museum's visitors are from out of state and hopes that more Boston guests will visit in the new year. The museum is a four-minute walk from the Mansfield MBTA Commuter Rail station. ON THE WEB For more information about the museum and to donate, visit: http://nbdmhc.org.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT But his youthful enthusiasm hit a wall that could have shut off his path to a technology education and career. \"I was taking the class and I didn't even have a computer at home. I would write the code out on paper and have a friend enter it,\" he recalls. \"At the end of the year, the teacher failed me - he didn't believe I could have written it.\" He was taken aback, and his parents were upset too, as they had seen him working on the project. But, he recalls, \"Back then, it was 'Whatever the teacher says, goes.'\" Reflecting on it recently, he says, \"If I had allowed that to hinder me, I wouldn't be where I am now.\" Today, at 40, he is CEO and president of Tech Wave Group, providing information technology consulting to clients ranging from individuals, small businesses and nonprofits to large institutions. On any given day, he might be providing help with network and security issues, web design and hosting, computer training or custom software applications such as inventory systems and databases. Gaining skills Brathwaite moved to Boston from Barbados as a teenager in the early 1990s. He finished his last two years of high school here and went on to Northeastern University to study computer science. When financial aid didn't cover all the bills, he landed a technician job at Verizon (then Bell Atlantic) while still a student. The company paid his college tuition and later sent him to Certified Novell Engineer network proficiency training at Clark University. Promotions propelled him to systems engineer and technical lead roles. At one point, being the only technical person in a marketing group allowed him to add business development and planning expertise, he says. Then came a setback. He had survived mergers and cuts in the telecommunications industry over six years, but eventually, after turning down a relocation to Texas, layoff was inevitable. He had been aiming for higher rungs on the ladder, but the corporate experience instilled indispensible skills. \"They taught me some intangible things,\" he says. \"There are people who work for Verizon their whole lives and never meet the CEO. I was in meetings, going to conferences, meeting the CEO - in a way, I got 'Business 101' thru Verizon. I learned confidence no matter who I'm meeting with, from CEOs to peers.\" Early clients With a realization he had valuable expertise to share, he took the leap to entrepreneurship, and Tech Wave was born. His first client was actually Verizon. Working for his former employer on a contract basis provided some stability for two years as he got his new business off the ground. One of his first clients outside Verizon was a small downtown law firm that became a longtime client. Another was Grove Hall Neighborhood Development Corporation, right in the neighborhood he knew since childhood. From there, the business grew to a fully functioning IT consulting firm, almost solely by wordof-mouth connections. Tech Wave Group now has an office in Dedham with meeting space and a computer lab and a satellite office in Dorchester, and clients have included such major institutions as Boston Medical Center and Boston University. Giving back Brathwaite spent a decade coaching young men in the Christian Youth Basketball League. Long hours in the business and a growing family at home (he and his wife have two children, ages 3 and 1) leave scant time for sports coaching now, but mentoring is still part of his approach. He enjoys providing internships to students, and over the years, a number of Tech Wave employees have been people he once coached on the basketball court. \"It's a privilege to see someone grow from a teen into a grown man, a college graduate, with that potential that he could work for me,\" he says. Despite his bruising brush with that doubting teacher in high school, Brathwaite has developed into a confident teacher himself. \"I've learned from a lot of mistakes. I'm an organized person and I like to streamline things, so it's easy for people to come in and follow the system. They leave knowing conceptually the different areas of IT and what they entail.\" What's next? Tech Wave keeps Brathwaite almost too busy to pause and plan for the future. But he would like to be able to hire more people, who would start as computer technicians and technical support specialists. And while he's pleased that Tech Wave has grown through word-of-mouth, he aims to devote more thought into additional marketing efforts. Another goal is to capitalize more on the firm's Minority Business Enterprise certification, which could help connect him to more customers. Recipe for success One of the good things about being in business for himself is flexibility, Brathwaite says, the freedom to take care of tasks and appointments during business hours. On the other hand, IT consulting work involves long and unpredictable hours. \"When the buck stops with you, if there's an issue, you have to be the one to do it,\" he says. The best business decision he's made? To treat every client like they're the only client. \"I know it sounds simple,\" he says, \"but I think that's what grows our business. We're not just offering technology. We have a personal touch.\" ON THE WEB Tech Wave Group: www.techwavegroup.com When the buck stops with you, if there's an issue, you have to be the one to do it.\" - Ryan Brathwaite",

METCO currently serves 3,300 students from Boston and Springfield annually with 37 suburban school districts and 190 schools participating. Arbaje-Thomas managed neighborhood antipoverty programs at Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD) for 15 years. As deputy director of ABCD Field Operations she provided leadership to 14 neighborhood sites and is credited with transforming those sites into integrated, full-service case management organizations serving the low-income community. During her tenure the number of people served tripled to 6,000 low-income residents annually. Arbaje-Thomas raised millions of dollars to support those efforts, building long-lasting partnerships with community agencies and private sector institutions. In addition to her citywide work, Arbaje-Thomas served as Director of ABCD's Parker Hill/ Fenway, Mattapan and Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Service Centers and the Citywide Hispanic Center. She is called a caring, passionate leader who challenges and motivates staff to perform at high professional standards. \"I am humbled and very excited by this outstanding opportunity to make a difference in the lives of so many children and families throughout Massachusetts,\" said Arbaje-Thomas. \"In today's world we need more than ever to come together and embrace diversity and inclusiveness and create educational opportunity for all, as occurs in the METCO program.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"That was a lot quicker than I thought it would be,\" the client said. While Bernat is savoring the successes of today's strong market, she earned her broker's license at the dawn of the great recession, turning to real estate after more than a decade working in the nonprofit sector. \"I just decided to take the leap in 2005, just as the market was starting to tank,\" she says. The trial by fire proved that Bernat had persistence. \"I honed my skills in a really tough market,\" she says. \"It was a while before I earned any money.\" The experience of working in a down market also gave Bernat some insight on what it takes to be successful in real estate. \"You have to be adaptable and resilient,\" she says. \"There's no replacement for experience. Even in today's world of technology, no two deals are alike. If you're someone who likes predictability, real estate is not for you.\" Bernat says it also pays to be a people person, of course. \"It's a service industry,\" she says. \"You have to like people a whole lot.\" Marketing, web presence Bernat recommends joining an established firm. She began her career with Hammond Associates before switching to Coldwell Banker. Like most brokers attached to firms, Bernat is an independent contractor, not an employee. The firm helps with marketing and provides a brick-andmortar office space for brokers to meet with clients. The large firms also have six-figure contracts with publications that list luxury residences, like a $2 million single-family home on 4.5 acres in Weston that Bernat has listed, or the $1.2 million condominium she has listed on Hutchings Street in Roxbury. \"We're on every single website - Boston Magazine, the Wall Street journal,\" she said. \"The internet strategy is important in today's market. You want to get your listing in front of every prospective buyer.\" Bernat says marketing is a crucial skill real estate brokers need to succeed. The most important marketing, she says, is word of mouth - a recommendation from a client's trusted friend. \"I'm a lifelong Boston resident,\" she says. \"It really is based on the people you know.\" Beyond that, Bernat has seen the internet rise as the most important marketing tool in her 14 years in real estate. Bernat was an early adopter of social media when it came into being, joining LinkedIn early on and using it to market her business. The website Property Spark listed Bernat at number one in its list of the Boston-area real estate brokers who are best at using social media. Even though listings and information have migrated to the internet, Bernat says the experience brokers bring to transactions is still their most important asset. \"Technology has changed our business, but it has not diminished the need for brokers,\" she says. \"Even though the customers have more information than ever, they don't necessarily know what to do with it.\" Another asset a good broker brings to the table: instinct. In her first year working, Bernat helped a client buy a single-family on Dorr Street in Roxbury's Highland Park section - one of the early new-construction townhouses in that neighborhood. Bernat saw the potential in the neighborhood, despite the proliferation of vacant lots on that street. Her keen eye for a good deal paid off. Over the next decade, values rose substantially in Highland Park and the vacant lots that once lined the street are now filled with new construction. \"When you walk down that street, much of what's there wasn't there 10 years ago\" Bernat says. When that same client sold the home recently, Bernat handled the listing and the seller walked away with a handsome profit. That scenario is not surprising to Bernat. It's what real estate brokers aim for - satisfied customers who bring repeat business and word-of-mouth referrals. You have to be adaptable and resilient. There's no replacement for experience. Even in today's world of technology, no two deals are alike. If you're someone who likes predictability, real estate is not for you.\" - Deborah Bernat ON THE WEB For more information about Deborah Bernat and Coldwell Banker and to see her current listings, visit: www.coldwellbankerhomes. com/ma/boston/agent/deborah-bernat/ aid_161674/",

Restaurants hire a lot of different people. As much as we can boost our businesses through the Black Restaurant Challenge, we can help build our workforce.\" Challenge organizers are asking people to visit four black-owned restaurants in Boston during the month of February and share photos and videos on the Challenge's Facebook page. A list of 38 featured restaurants in several neighborhoods can be found on the website for the kickoff event. Faulk noted that the choice of where to spend money has transformative power. \"We want to show people that if they are intentional about where they spend their money, and support these businesses, the businesses can begin to thrive, they can hire more people, create more community events, and, through a ripple effect, change the dynamic of neighborhoods,\" he said. By garnering more support for local businesses, organizers say, the Boston Black Restaurant Challenge can also encourage more people to go into business for themselves. \"A lot of people around here have great ideas, great potential, are very skilled, can cook very well, and are jacks and jills of all trades,\" Tyler said. \"If they could just see a place like Suya Joint in their neighborhood, they would think 'Hey, I can cook really well, maybe I can open a place like this myself.'\" Visibility Suya Joint has been popular with local residents and members of the Nigerian community in the two years since its opened, but broader visibility could attract a larger customer base. Tyler teamed up with several groups for the Boston Black Restaurant Challenge, including the Dorchester-based Outside the Box Agency, a marketing and PR firm. \"Visibility is the key issue here,\" said Outside the Box principal founder Justin Springer. \"Not a lot of people know about Suya, even though it's an amazing restaurant. We can't wait for the Boston Globe to do coverage or Phantom Gourmet to make a documentary. That's why we're promoting places like Suya Joint. We'll visit different restaurants through this whole month, interview the owners, and get their stories out there on different platforms, like Facebook Live.\" Springer snapped footage for Instagram and Facebook as Suya Joint filled in celebration that evening. Employees at the restaurant increase its visibility through the restaurant's social media presence. Shamara Rhodes, founder of the organization Bringing Back Boston, also DJs for Suya Joint at its weekly events. \"It's been an amazing experiencing working for Suya Joint, networking with people in the city, and then bringing into the restaurant to show them African food,\" said Rhodes. Drive and tenacity To tell the story of Suya Joint, one must understand the determination of its founder, Cecelia Lizotte. She opened the restaurant in 2012, after emigrating from Nigeria in 1999. \"I worked for National Lumber as a receptionist. I would make my own lunch and bring it to work. This co-worker sees it and asked, 'Where did you buy that from?' and I told him I made it.\" Lizotte catered jobs for this coworker for three years, until he offered to be her partner in business, which meant providing the capital to open a restaurant. \"What drove me was my grandmother in Nigeria,\" Lizotte said. \"I saw her cook for the whole entire community, and even though they were paying, people were so excited to come and eat her food. The excited and happy faces gave me the drive. And the lack of African establishments in the Boston area.\" She reached out to members of the community to find the resources she needed. \"You can see online what you need to do to open a restaurant. You file with ServSafe, for example. And if you don't know how to do it, there's always a number that you can call. I called the police department in Hyde Park, for example, telling them what I was trying to do and asking about ServSafe. Through making those kind of connections, I got leads. I learned about CropCircle Kitchen (a food business incubator) in Jamaica Plain, for example, which helped me.\" The way that Lizotte prepares food exemplifies her tenacity. \"A lot of the ingredients I use, I have to get from Africa,\" she said. \"They're dense, costly and it's often my mother going and getting them. I use quality control and make sure she gets the best ingredients. Most of the time, really, I fly over there to get it, and bring back the ingredients myself.\" At the kickoff of the Black Restaurant Challenge last week, the faces of people eating Lizotte's cooking looked both happy and excited. A lot of people around here have great ideas, great potential, are very skilled, can cook very well, and are jacks and jills of all trades. If they could just see a place like Suya Joint in their neighborhood, they would think 'Hey, I can cook really well, maybe I can open a place like this myself.'\" - Chyna Tyler ON THE WEB For more information about the Boston Black Restaurant Challenge, visit: https://bostonblackrestaurantchallenge. weebly.com For more information about Suya Joint, visit: https://suyajoint.com/ What drove me was my grandmother in Nigeria.

      "body": "FULL TEXT When people are sick, they need an accessible place to go for affordable care. Few urban areas of the country are any more dependent on community health centers to provide this care than Dorchester, Mattapan, Roxbury and the South End. Collectively, Bowdoin Street, Codman Square, Dimock, DotHouse Health, Geiger Gibson, Harvard Street, Mattapan, Neponset, Upham's Corner, Whittier Street and South End health centers serve more than 148,000 patients, or one in six Boston residents. As such, we are committed to maintaining our full range of high-quality services for all patients - but it isn't easy, and we're worried we will soon have to take the same drastic measures we are seeing in other areas of the U.S. Community health centers around the country are facing tough choices. They are laying off staff, cutting back services, such as treatment for opioid addiction or onsite ultrasounds for pregnant women, and planning for site closures. Health care for more than 27 million people is being managed on a month-to-month basis because Congress has failed to extend funding for community health centers. Vendors cannot be paid. Doctors cannot be recruited or persuaded to remain in some of the most medically underserved areas. Mobile health vans may not have the gas money to drive to the hardest to reach populations. Medicines and other supplies may not be purchased beyond next month. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has projected that the funding cliff could result in the closure of 2,800 health center sites throughout the U.S. and a loss of health care access for up to 9 million patients. In Massachusetts, funding losses could approach $196 million with 140,000 losing access to care. For Dorchester, Mattapan, Roxbury and the South End, a loss of close to $13.1 million in funding puts more than 10,721 patients at risk. This is not how a health system should be operated - particularly the community health center system that has served the nation so well both in terms of saving lives and dollars. Health centers like ours have been providing care for more than 50 years, opening access to quality services and providing a more affordable option for preventive care than a hospital emergency room. Not only do we generate $24 billion in health care cost savings, we are also innovators that work with community partners to respond to public health crises, such as trauma and violence, the opioid epidemic and the recent disasters that struck Texas, Florida, California and Puerto Rico. There is little doubt that health centers have contributed significantly to cost savings for the American taxpayer. Our record of success is why community health centers have earned bipartisan support from U.S. Presidents and lawmakers. And here's the bitter irony behind the health center funding cliff: most everyone agrees that Congress should extend funding and act now. Lawmakers must move beyond the political debate and focus on public health. Our Massachusetts congressional delegation and state leaders have a long history of advocating on our behalf, but they need your help now in spurring national bipartisan action. Sign up as a health center advocate today at www.hcaadvocacy.org and join to let elected officials know what your health center means to you and your community. In Massachusetts, funding losses could approach $196 million with 140,000 losing access to care.\" Philiomin Laptiste, Bowdoin Street Health Center, Sandra Cotterell, Codman Square Health Center, Myechia Minter-Jordan, MD, Dimock Community Health Center, Michelle Nadow, DotHouse Health, Chuck Jones, Geiger Gibson & Daniel Driscoll-Neponset Health Centers, Stan A.

      "body": "FULL TEXT And since January, about 900 Bostonians have been taking part in Citizen Read, a series of public conversations about \"Citizen\" in advance of the Feb. 24 world premiere of Rankine's play, \"The White Card.\" An American Repertory Theater (ART) production presented by ArtsEmerson and directed by ART Artistic Director Diane Paulus, \"The White Card\" will be on stage through April 1 at the Emerson Paramount Center in downtown Boston. Race dialogue Both the play and the book explore entrenched but unexamined assumptions related to race. Through searing anecdotes, essays and passages of poetry, \"Citizen\" recounts \"micro-aggressions,\" racially demeaning moments in daily life, and reflects on \"macro-aggressions,\" such as police shootings of unarmed youth. \"My idea for the play started because in touring for 'Citizen,' I had so many conversations with people who'd come to hear me read, who had read the book and wanted to talk about it,\" says Rankine. \"I realized that we Americans don't have practice talking about racial issues in public, that people were easily offended, or defended, or made upset.\" Discussions led by trained facilitators will follow every performance of \"The White Card,\" and on March 4, Rankine will host a dialogue on race with Citizen Read participants at the Emerson Cutler Majestic Theatre. A professor of poetry at Yale University, Rankine is the author of five collections of poetry, including \"Citizen,\" which received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry and was also a finalist for the National Book Award. The book also won the NAACP Award and PEN Open Book and Literary Awards, and it is the only poetry book to be a New York Times bestseller in nonfiction. As powerful as it is to read, \"Citizen\" also offers a rich sampling of works by contemporary African-American visual artists, whose sculptures, paintings and collages are displayed throughout the text. \"Black visual artists have been doing work of investigating race,\" says Rankine. \"When we think about race, it's often a visual issue.\" Imagined construct The play \"The White Card\" unfolds in the rarified world of top New York art dealers and patrons. Its protagonist, and the sole black character in a cast of five, is Charlotte, an up-andcoming visual artist. Her photograph-based images are sought by Charles, who collects works by African American artists that evoke black suffering and victimization, purchasing the works with wealth he has earned by building for-profit prisons. In the first act, Charles and his wife Virginia host a dinner in their elegant Tribeca loft, joined by their son Alex, a college student and social justice activist, and their guests, Charlotte and Eric, an art dealer who has helped Charles assemble his collection. The second act occurs a year later, in Charlotte's studio, a setting conducive to a shift in both perspective and interpersonal dynamics. Artists of all kinds are participating in another public venture led by Rankine, the Racial Imaginary Institute, a New York-based think tank and presentation space dedicated to investigating race as a construct of the imagination. As a 2016 fellow of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Rankine received a no-stringsattached grant of $625,000 that she is using to found RII, which has already hosted a series of free readings, artist talks, podcasts and exhibitions that explore prevailing racial assumptions. Its inviting website describes RII as an interdisciplinary cultural laboratory that is conducting \"a democratized exploration of race in our lives.\" The name 'racial imaginary' is meant \"to capture the enduring truth of race: it is an invented concept that nevertheless operates with extraordinary force in our daily lives, limiting our movements and imaginations.\" Commenting on the synergies among her projects, Rankine says, \"This play for example, would be something we'd be interested in staging because we're interested in looking at how whiteness is perceived in American culture. You could say that culture has been in collusion with certain narratives that support ideas around white dominance.\" Such assumptions will be subject to a closer look in \"The White Card\" and in the conversations that follow each performance. \"I hope that the play is useful, entertaining, and allows the audience to think about these questions,\" says Rankine. \"It draws no conclusions. The play really is invested in how conversations around race get derailed, and begin again, and what misconceptions there are in the attempt to have these conversations. It's an exploration.\" ON THE WEB For more information about ArtsEmerson and \"The White Card,\" visit: artsemerson.org For more information about RII, visit: https://theracialimaginary.org",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Shamefully, Massachusetts now holds the designation as the \"Worst State for Hispanics and Latinos,\" in terms of economic inequality, according to a study by 24/7 Wall Street, which was published in USA Today. What does that mean? By a number of socioeconomic measures - poverty, income, educational attainment, unemployment, and incarceration - Massachusetts has the worst inequality between white and Hispanic residents - in the entire United States. While the typical Bay State white household earns $82,029 a year, the median income for Hispanic households is just $39,742. This isn't the first study to shine a light on such inequalities. Previous reports from the Greater Boston Latino Network and Boston Foundation showed Latinos are largely absent from positions of power across the region. None of our statewide elected officials are Latinos, and there are few in the Legislature or city halls across the state. In Boston Public Schools, Latinos make up 40 percent of our students, but less than 10 percent of teachers. The Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education recently missed its opportunity to select the first ever Latino Commissioner of Education, passing up a Latina candidate with impeccable credentials for a more well-connected white male. That's the story we hear across the state. And it means that my daughter and her friends have woefully few role models to look up to. And as they attend college they may feel even more isolated. Just 23 percent of Latino adults in Massachusetts hold a college education. In the corporate sector, the outlook is similarly dim. Highly-educated and experienced Latinos get pigeonholed into token positions such as \"Director of Diversity and Inclusion\" so companies can claim they have addressed the diversity problem, while leaving Latinos out of the C-Suites. As a result, our corporations pay lip-service to diversity, while never creating the policies or pipeline to support the next generation of colorful talent. So what is the solution to these inequalities? How should our political, academic and corporate leaders ensure that Massachusetts sheds our shameful designation as the \"Worst State for Latinos? First a bit of self-reflection. We need to look in the mirror and recognize that things have not gotten better for Latinos - not since my family first came here from Argentina. Next we need to push. Push for our political leaders, schools and businesses to be more diverse. Every major position should require that people of color be interviewed in the hiring pool. And if they are not, the position should be taken down and re-posted to target a more diverse audience. More government contracts should go to minority-owned businesses. This would create wealth for a community that has a strong entrepreneurial spirit, but no army of lobbyists to represent them. And in our schools, we need to set a requirement that our teachers, administrators and officials represent the demographics of our growing Latino student population. If Latinos make up 40 percent of students, they must also make up 40 percent of the teachers leading them. Bar none. This would allow my daughter to look up to the front of the class and have the same feeling a hope that I felt as a little girl coming to Massachusetts a generation ago.

      "body": "FULL TEXT The structure of the book, like a travel guide, makes the information digestible and easy to access. Bite-sized stories about locations and people intermingle with maps, photographs and extras like the recipe for Hard Tack Bread that appears in the Hyde Park section. The book is available for purchase at the Museum of African American History on Joy Street, the Old South Meeting House Gift Shop and Porter Square Books in Cambridge. It can also be found at the Central and Mattapan branches of the Boston Public Library. In her research, Elder found some wonderful, unexpected stories. In Medford, Massachusetts in 1783, Belinda Sutton sued for reparations for 50 years of uncompensated work for the Royall household. She was awarded 15 pounds, 12 shillings in damages, to be paid annually. This was 80 years before the Emancipation Proclamation. In the Jamaica Plain section, Elder writes about the African American Master Artists in Residence Program (AAMARP). Northeastern University's Department of African Studies has sponsored the program since 1977. To this day it provides studio spaces, lectures and exhibitions to members. The Piano Factory and Gallery in the South End is another landmark that remains active in the contemporary art world. In 1854 it was the largest piano factory in the nation and in the 1980s it was renovated into artist studios and exhibition space. Elder notes artists Paul Goodnight and Milton Derr as creators with studios in the building. Now called Piano Craft Gallery, its exhibition space displays new work every month. The Roxbury section of the book has a substantial piece devoted to Elma Lewis, founder of the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists. She is historically significant as a pioneer of black creative spaces. Lewis' work also has influenced Alvin Ailey's celebration of 50 years performing in Boston. The group paid homage to her in their panel discussion in December 2017. Her love of dance also inspired the Revelations dance workshops Alvin Ailey will be hosting Feb. 24 at The Salvation Army Ray and Joan Kroc Corps Community Center. The weaving of history and current culture makes the book both referentially informative and a contemporary guide. It also sheds light on how much the past informs the presents. Society moves forward by looking back, and \"African American Heritage in Massachusetts\" lets you do both.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Around that time, Amenta said he began noticing a shift in the industry, \"where it wasn't all about traditional PR anymore - companies were now calling themselves integrated marketing companies.\" After a stint leading the PR division at another agency, Altus Marketing and Management, he prepared to take on a pair of clients independently, all the while thinking, \"What it would be like to open up your own business?\" The two clients agreed to hire him through his independent venture and, he said, \"It just snowballed from there. I picked up a couple clients, then a couple more, then a couple more.\" if you do good work and you keep your circles and networks tight, then you're going to have a good reputation,\" he said. During the first eight months of starting his new company, Amenta kept overhead costs low. He was the sole employee and because of the nature of the industry, he was able to work from his computer at home, in coffee shops and sometimes, in his clients' offices. \"I'm proud to say that I haven't had to take one dollar from a loan,\" said Amenta. \"I know that in other situations, people could get lending and that would give them the opportunity to catapult their business a lot quicker, but I took a lot of pride in starting it from scratch and making sure that every dollar counted.\" Slow and steady Implementing the business management skills he learned at Bryant, Amenta said that in scaling his business, he was cautious in making decisions to hire people and take on new clients. He would always first consider the company's revenue generated over the last quarter and what he expected to generate in the upcoming quarter. \"It was like playing chess. Even though I see the end goal, I had to be strategic and not move too fast,\" he said. Amenta did eventually make his first hire in 2013, and the pair worked in a tiny office in the North End. In the beginning, DPA took on clients such as Haymakers for Hope, a nonprofit charity organizer for cancer fundraising, one of the company's first clients ever and still today, a loyal client. \"We've watched them grow, they've watched us grow. We've grown together and they have become friends in addition to being clients,\" said Amenta. DPA also worked with DraftKings, \"during the early years before they became this Earned reputation According to Amenta, although DPA focuses on PR, the agency runs campaigns through an overall marketing strategy. \"So we don't do PR just for the sake of PR, we look at our clients' goals and objectives and figure out how we can have a good PR outcome,\" he said. Sometimes the client's goal is increased awareness and exposure, or more foot traffic at an event. The integrated strategy might involve a radio interview or a strategic alliance with a digital influencer or blogger. Sometimes it's a combination of press exposure and business partnerships. \"They're all intertwined, it's wild,\" said Amenta. Amenta said he largely built off of the reputation he had nurtured during the earlier part of his caree. \"Boston is a small city and it kind of feels like everybody's one degree of separation from the other person. ... I learned early on international powerhouse,\" he said. \"We had the privilege of working with those guys and got them good local, regional and national press coverage.\" Expansion Approaching its six-year mark, DPA has a main office in the North End, works with 12 to 15 clients per month, and has five full-time employees and two interns. One intern, currently an Emerson College student, is a videographer and has been helping the agency create videos to use as a storytelling tool for clients in need of content marketing. Amenta shared another exciting development: DPA Communications recently launched a second office in Los Angeles, officially becoming a bi-coastal PR and marketing agency. \"The dream here is to grow this thing as large as possible can without moving too fast,\" said Amenta. \"We have the right person in place there and right opportunities coming along.\" DPA's account director for LA is currently based at a WeWork location to not only keep starting costs low, but also network with other entrepreneurs in the area. In a media landscape filled with memes, bloggers and Snapchat videos, the team at DPA Communications has plenty to keep them on their toes. Recently they worked with viral sensation, Ryan the Selfie Kid, the Hingham, Massachusetts native caught on camera at this year's Super Bowl halftime show fiddling with his cellphone as Justin Timberlake danced alongside him. He subsequently racked up thousands of followers on social media. \"As wild as that seems, he got thrust into digital influencer territory,\" said Amenta. \"We're actually working with Ryan and his family, to make sure that whatever brands are looking to align with Ryan, are aligned with what a 13-year-old kid should be aligning himself with.\" That includes issues that Ryan himself cares about, like anti-bullying campaigns. \"The clients run the gamut, we don't focus on a specific niche,\" said Amenta. \"We work with every industry that exists and work with every publication and brand on behalf of those clients.\" Boston is a small city and it kind of feels like everybody's one degree of separation from the other person. ... I learned early on if you do good work and you keep your circles and networks tight, then you're going to have a good reputation.\" - Dominic Amenta",

When they do include accompanying music, Sweet Honey works with blues and soul rhythms and the chants and drumbeats often found in African music. Their a cappella base rhythms, made through clapping and scatting, follow a similar path. The upcoming concert will feature instrument-inclusive tracks from their newly released album, \"#LoveInEvolution.\" Often their songs have a narrative, spoken-world quality to them, alluding to the tradition of passing music and stories down orally. In \"Second Line Blues,\" the musicians list off names of police brutality victims and school shooting sites to the tune of a soft snare drum. Their music makes the audience think as much as it makes them dance and sway. \"One of my main interests is the environment,\" says Kahlil. \"But we're also making people aware of inequities in social systems.\" In addition to national issues, the group performs on the themes of living as women, and women of color. Their songs cover romance, ambition and staying positive, among many other motifs. Kahlil says the group's message and desire is to be uplifting and informative. Concerts that spark dialogues about the issues mentioned are the most successful. Tickets for the event can be purchased online or by phone and also will be sold the night of the show at the Jordan Hall box office, 30 Gainsborough St., Boston. Proceeds from the evening will go towards student services at Roxbury Community College. \"We are thrilled to have Sweet Honey in the Rock performing at our first-ever celebrity fundraiser,\" said Vice President of Advancement and Community Engagement Lorita Williams in a press release. \"We hope that this evening of wonderful music centered on social justice provides our community with an opportunity to heal, with the added benefit of proceeds supporting the important mission of RCC.\" On the Web For more information about the event, visit: www.rcc.mass.edu/banner/973sweet-honey-in-the-rock To purchas tickets to Sweet Honey in the Rock, visit: www.aceticket.com/ sweet-honey-in-the-rock-jordan-hall-9-30/ event-old/1796856",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"It was abandoned for twenty-something years,\" said DaSilva of the three-story Victorian-style house that was once a nursing home. \"It was an eyesore to the community.\" Today, the house would fetch twenty times the original selling price, on par with the housing and construction boom in the neighborhood and the rest of the city - and the entrepreneur wants in on that boom. Scaling up DaSilva moved to Boston in 1979 from Cape Verde at age 17, finishing high school at Madison Park High School and then graduating from Wentworth Institute of Technology with a degree in architecture. Before starting his own venture, he worked for various architecture and construction companies, the city of Boston and local organizations such as Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative. \"This country gives opportunities to people like myself from parts of Roxbury or Dorchester, where people say are 'disadvantaged' areas, but also have a lot of advantages to some of us who are immigrants,\" said DaSilva. He started DCCS with his own savings, moving from one small project to the next and keeping operating costs minimal by operating out of his home and subcontracting labor. Before long, \"The word of mouth kept it going,\" DaSilva said. Since then, DaSilva said his company has grown modestly, with his staff team comprising himself, a designer, an accountant and five carpenters. \"We sub out when we need a bigger crew,\" he added. But he emphasized that all of his workers, even his subcontractors, are local to the neighborhood or the city. The company's main selling point is efficiency. \"We bring anybody we need to get things done,\" DaSilva said. He explained that if an owner of a property wants to renovate his home, he'd have to hire an architect, then hire a general contractor to price the project, go back to the architect to implement any adjustments, and then get the permits and hire other contractors to complete the labor. \"With us, it's with one contract, one agreement,\" he said. \"We are a team of designers, builders, zoning permit experts, all in one company.\" DCCS, a certified Minority Business Enterprise, has worked on projects for clients like Boston College, Northeastern University, Codman Square NDC and Nuestra Comunidad CDC, and one of its biggest projects was a $600,000 contract with Madison Park Village in 2016. DaSilva said he hopes to do more of the larger scale projects. \"It has taken a long time for us to scale. The majority of minority companies tend to not scale,\" he said. When asked why not, he responded, \"Access to capital. And the stigma we have out here that minority companies are not professional enough or don't know what they are doing.\" DCCS was able to get a contract with Madison Park Village because of a $200,000 loan from MassHousing and Massachusetts Growth Capital Corporation, DaSilva said. \"In projects like that, you work 60 days before you can get paid,\" he said. \"That's why a lot of small minority contractors can't work on these big projects because they don't have the capital to pay their workforce two months in advance.\" He continued, \"There is a city boom, but how many minorities are actually doing it? We are a majority in the city. If we are, why are we not working these projects that have big dollar values? It's an issue that needs to be dealt with, and some of us are not being called to sit at those tables.\" DaSilva said that DCCS would be open to working with bigger general contracting companies to take on smaller portions of a project such as roofing or framing. Immigrant family homes While trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in Boston's development, DaSilva said that DCCS just recently launched a new subsidiary project: American House Edition. AHE will specialize in suburban home renovation and additions such as garages, second floor or rear extension, targeted to immigrant families. \"Most houses that immigrants are buying, smaller houses, need to have additions because the immigrant family structure usually has three to four kids, an in-law, an uncle or grandparent,\" said DaSilva. And similar to the company's city projects, most of the work would be in-house. \"We are able to price your project as we design, file for zoning permits and then build your home addition, much faster and on budget,\" said DaSilva. In addition to venturing outside the city, the company is not shying away from innovative technology, like their new implementation of virtual reality. With a VR viewer connected to an app on a smartphone, clients can see what the company's interior designs would look like, before work on the home even starts. Home sweet home At the Howland Street headquarters, DCCS is located in the bottom level of the house and DaSilva lives on the upper levels with his family. In 1999, DCCS gutted the entire interior and converted it into a two-family dwelling, complete with high ceilings, hardwood floors, and plentiful windows. The DaSilva home is a fine example of DCCS craftsmanship, but the smell of home-cooked food and a friendly dog bounding up to visitors are undeniable manifestations of the American Dream.

      "body": "FULL TEXT But all the preparation in the world doesn't prepare an entrepreneur for relentless rejection from restaurants, retail shops and other businesses. \"For every 'yes,' you get 100 rejections,\" Barrie said. \"My first 'yes' had nothing to do with HVAC. It was a gentleman who wanted me to do some wiring, wall repair and painting.\" Barrie let the customer, a Hyde Park homeowner, know he specialized in HVAC systems. Satisfied with the quality ofhis work, that customer referred Barrie to others, leading to HVAC contracts. Business spread by word of mouth. While he struggled for the first six months, Barrie says, the second half of the year was surprisingly lucrative. That was 17 years ago. Today, Barrie employs 14 men, all of whom are currently working on major projects including the Bartlett Place housing and retail development and the Marriott Residence Inn under construction on Parcel 9, both in the Dudley Square area. His firm has recently completed work on a 24-unit condo complex in the Forest Hills section of Jamaica Plain and new apartment buildings in the Four Corners and Savin Hill sections of Dorchester. Most of his employees and the subcontractors he hires are people of color who live in Boston. Opportunity strikes Barrie, who grew up in Boston and Burlington after moving to the United States from Sierra Leone at age 10, says he's enjoying the city's current building boom. \"I can look at new buildings and say, 'I helped build that,'\" he says. \"I enjoy re-building the neighborhoods in Boston that have been neglected for so long.\" Standing in the utility room at Bartlett Place, a bare, windowless room that will house the building's heating system, Barrie consults architectural plans on his iPad as he advises a team of plumbers on how to bring in the unit heaters, pipes, boilers and water tanks that will keep the apartments warm. \"We'll crane 'em up,\" he says. On the roof outside the mechanical room, a 6-by-15-foot chiller will be hoisted in place to provide cooling for the building. Throughout the building, Barrie's workers have installed the ductwork that will bring the air down from the mechanical room and keep residents comfortable. Barrie has grown familiar enough with the complex workings of modern apartment systems. He also enjoys working on older buildings, along with the challenging problems they pose. An early project Barrie enjoyed was a remodeling project featured on PBS' \"This Old House\" show, a Second Empire Victorian two-family on Woodbine Street renovated by contractor David Lopes. Barrie received help scaling up his business from real estate developers and general contractors Arnold Johnson and George Chin, whose Crossroads Construction company has added scores of units to Roxbury's housing stock over the past two decades. \"They've been instrumental in helping minority firms grow,\" Barrie said. Johnson and Chin gave Barrie his first break with the Washington Commons project, a development consisting of 35 single-family and multi-unit buildings at the corner of Washington Street and Martin Luther King Boulevard on land cleared during the city's urban renewal program in the 1960s. \"I was just 26 years old,\" Barrie says. \"They took a chance with me. But it ended up being successful. Ever since then, we've been working together.\" As Crosswinds has taken on larger projects, such as Bartlett Yard, Barrie has come along with the firm, hiring more hands to increase his capacity to get the job done. In the current building boom, Barrie says, his biggest challenge is finding enough skilled tradespeople to keep up with the demand. With so much work, Barrie is now in a position that contrasts sharply with his early days in the trade, marked by repeated rejections. \"I've never seen it this busy in all the years I've been in business,\" he said. \"We turn away more work than we accept.\" \"I can look at new buildings and say, 'I helped build that.' I enjoy re-building the neighborhoods in Boston that have been neglected for so long.\" - Abdul Barrie ON THE WEB Environmental Systems Engineering: www.esecorphvac.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT I'm With Her members are fiddler Sara Watkins, Sarah Jarosz on multiple string instruments and Aoife O'Donovan on guitar. Each an artist with a strong career on her own, they formed their trio in 2014 after an impromptu performance together at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Colorado. Despite their name - a pro-Hillary slogan during the 2016 presidential campaign - no political message surfaced during the concert. Back in March 2016, however, Watkins was on the Sanders stage for another Celebrity Series concert, joining folk stars Patty Griffin and Anais Mitchell for a vote-rallying \"Use Your Voice\" concert tour. An array of talents At the Sanders Theatre, dressed in casual tops, black tapered pants and platform shoes, the women stood together, close enough to unite their voices in tight harmonies and engage in easy exchange, such as a sizzling duo with Watkins on her fiddle and Jarosz on banjo. Behind the women stood an array of string instruments. Most were there for Jarosz, a nimble multi-instrumentalist, who took turns on a mandolin, octave mandolin and guitar during the show. A 2017 double-Grammy-winner for Best Folk Album and Best American Roots Performance, Jarosz is gifted also with a strong, plain voice. Watkins stuck to her fiddle, which she played with high spirit and energy. Formerly a member of the Grammy-winning progressive bluegrass band Nickel Creek, Watkins has an alluring voice with a plaintive quality that gives whatever she sings emotional authority. Leading the trio in soaring harmonies with her mellow vocals was Aoife O'Donovan, vocalist of the Boston-based progressive string band Crooked Still and a featured singer on the Grammy-winning bluegrass album by renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma, \"The Goat Rodeo Sessions.\" In the course of about an hour-and-a-half, including their encore, the women sang a repertoire mainly of their own songs in treatments that skirted sweetness in favor of inventiveness. Similar tunes At times, with their tight harmonies and quirky arrangements, I'm With Her resembled an earlier trio in the genre, the Roche sisters, denizens of Greenwich Village whose trio The Roches gained a devoted following in the 1970s and '80s, with tour stops that included the University Lutheran Church in Harvard Square. The ensemble also called to mind a fine local trio, the Lula Wiles band, who perform at local clubs and on July 6 will appear at both the Boston Public Library and later, at a pop-up beer garden in Allston. How satisfying it would be to experience I'm With Her at such close range, the better to appreciate the intricacy of their artistry and to better hear their lyrics. One of I'm With Her's finest moments came during the encore, in which they let loose with a lyric-free piece that drew the audience into the euphoric magic of an old-time string band. The group's warm-up act, and a good one, was singer and acoustic guitarist Andrew Combs. In its simplicity, his solo performance suited the grand theater better: all he gave out with voice and guitar could reach every seat. Combs, 28, draws on his Texas roots and Nashville country traditions with an unadorned and affecting style of his own and strong vocals that occasionally rose into the high, lonesome sound of trills. He introduced songs with low-key humor and brief comments about his family and musician friends such as Joe, John Denver's cowboy, whose ode to a woman had an infectious, danceable rhythm. By the time his half-hour set was over, Combs had won a fan club for himself, his 7-month-old daughter and eccentric wife - the muse of his best songs.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Or perhaps because patrons in the Dudley Square area continue to crave traditional coffee and food hailing from the Horn of Africa, also served by the Somalian business, Hafun Cafe, that previously occupied the space at 51 Roxbury St. Whatever the reason may be, Defar says, \"There's a lot of potential in this area.\" While some residents and business owners are wary of some of the development changes in Roxbury, Defar saw it as an opportunity to expand. \"There is a diverse, as well as a new emerging community,\" he says, noting the changes he's observed ever since first moving and buying a house in the neighborhood in 2005. Roots and culture Born in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, Defar learned to cook first from his mother, then at school, and then later with a scholarship at a culinary school in Switzerland. When he came to the U.S., he had every intention of opening his own restaurant, eager to share his culture. Defar launched Fasika in 2003, boasting slow-cooked cuisine made with spices directly from Ethiopia. Menu items include kitfo, a minced lean beef with spicy seasoning plate, and tikil gomen, a veggie dish cooked in turmeric sauce. Fasika Cafe is essentially a fast-casual extension of its sister restaurant, serving both American and Ethiopian coffee and tea, as well as breakfast dishes like eggs, omelets and Ethiopian dulet. \"When forming the menu, I thought of the community here. There's a lot of workers from the surrounding office buildings,\" says Defar. \"So, it's not a strictly typical Ethiopian menu, but gives different options for people.\" Fasika Cafe will have various daily specials including Greek salads, American-inspired sandwiches and Italian-inspired pasta. One regular customer, Tee Belachew, sticks to the traditional dulet for breakfast, a dish comprised of liver, tripe and spices. \"I love coming here, it's great traditional food that's also healthy and organic,\" says Belachew, who is also originally from Ethiopia. He says he likes to bring his twoyear-old son to give him a taste of his own culture. He also says he has known Defar for over 15 years and regularly goes to the Fasika restaurant. Looking ahead With loan financing, Defar and his wife, Balayesh, leased the vacant restaurant space and remodeled the interior with new floors and a new fully-equipped kitchen. Last Friday in the early afternoon, Defar was working the cafe on his own, taking customers' orders and cooking the food fresh and on-the-spot. \"There are benefits and challenges to having another restaurant,\" said Defar. \"There is the possible financial reward, but it's not easy with just my wife and I working.\" Defar said once more people hear about the new cafe, he will hire three more employees. Besides himself and Balayesh, he only has one employee so far. To spread the word, the restaurateur and chef has been printing Fasika Cafe menus and distributing them in the nearby office buildings. His future plans for Fasika Cafe includes getting a liquor license to serve beer and wine, and offering daily food specials buffet style. Considering the level of success his flagship restaurant has had in providing comforting, finger-food friendly and affordable dishes to the Somerville community, there's a good chance Fasika Cafe will fit right into Dudley Square.

There's a lot of workers from the surrounding office buildings. So, it's not a strictly typical Ethiopian menu, but gives different options for people.\" - Befekadu Defar",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Hundreds of people turned out to push for comprehensive reform, with phone calls, letters, emails, rallies, speeches, hearings, and one-on-one meetings. Poll after poll showed that we were making headway with the public, as a wide majority of Bay Staters supported key reforms. We got two different bills through the Senate and House last year, but it still wasn't clear whether the final legislation would include deeply necessary, crucial reforms - until now. Last week, I was proud to stand with my colleagues and advocates as the Legislature's conference committee released the finalized version of the criminal justice package. The package includes a comprehensive array of reforms that will fix issues all throughout the criminal justice pipeline. This bill is a massive and joyful turning point for our state. It includes key reforms to institute implicit bias and de-escalation training for local law enforcement, reduce the school-toprison pipeline, fix our broken bail system, increase diversion to drug treatment, raise the felony threshold to make sure punishment is proportional to the crime, put important limits and data collection around the use of solitary confinement, significantly reform the CORI system to better support re-entry, reduce fines and fees on ex-offenders that tend to criminalize poverty and pull people back into incarceration and repeal some of the ineffective and racist \"mandatory minimums\" for nonviolent drug offenses. These reforms finally start to honor the needs of communities that experience the most crime and who are too often ignored. As Massachusetts increased the proportion of our people that we lock up four fold over the past few decades, it's these communities that have borne the damage: getting pulled into generational cycles of crime and poverty. This bill now includes serious evidence-based reforms that will make our criminal justice system - from start to finish - more effective. And they put our state on a path to right a moral wrong, and truly live up to the values we hold dear. There is, of course, more to do to fully reform the criminal justice system, and we will keep fighting to build on this progress. But this is a moment to celebrate our substantive victory for justice. The people of the Commonwealth owe a debt of gratitude to Chairman Brownsberger and Chairwoman Cronin, who co-chaired the committee that worked on this bill - and especially to the thousands of advocates who've worked hard for these reforms. It has been my distinct honor to work with all of you to fight for true justice in our Commonwealth. I'm inspired to see the outstanding victories we can win together. These reforms finally start to honor the needs of communities that experience the most crime and who are too often ignored. \" - Sonia Chang-Diaz Sonia Chang Diaz represents the 2nd Suffolk District in the Massachusetts Senate and is chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Education.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT BAMS Fest will feature two stages; an art zone where local muralists will work live; a dance zone where local urban choreographers will teach dance of the African diaspora; a marketplace of local black vendors; and a food truck zone. Morris will release the artist roster in April. Despite receiving performance applications from all over the globe, she says, the festival lineup heavily features local artists. \"It's my hope with BAMS Festival that we can celebrate arts and culture in a safe space that speaks to the history of Franklin Park and the community,\" says Morris. Over the last two years, BAMS Fest has organized and supported many events bringing diverse music and arts into the Boston art scene. Hip-hop artist Latrell James, a Dorchester native, has performed at a number of BAMS Fest events and was featured in their Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign video. \"Not only have they put me in front of new audiences, but I've performed in spaces I didn't even know existed,\" he says. BAMS Fest is first and foremost about community. The Boston art scene is known for its lack of diversity, and many talented African American artists leave the city because of this inhospitable environment. \"I hope the world starts to see Boston for positive things and not just inequity and gentrification and racism,\" says Morris. \"Our city is moving towards something progressive. I hope arts and culture can be used to solve problems.\" James says his Dorchester roots have strongly influenced him and his music. \"Being in Dorchester, you can get to a prestigious college a bus ride away, but you're also near intense poverty. Growing up in that area had a huge effect on me,\" he says. By participating in BAMS Fest, James hopes to highlight the black artistry that blooms in underserved communities. The BAMS Fest fundraising remains active, and Morris stresses that these funds are primarily for the payment of artists. The festival has been long in the making so that it could be done right, which includes properly paying artists for their time and work, she says. Vendor applications for the festival are open until May 11. Morris has been working on BAMS Fest for five years, and she hopes with the fruits of her labor, there will be a turning point in Boston's art scene. She says, \"I'm hoping that Boston natives and residents feel proud and start to believe in the fact that someone paid attention when cultural programming didn't cater to their needs.\" ON THE WEB For more information about BAMS Festival, visit: www.bamsfest.org/",

      "body": "FULL TEXT This is the situation most individuals find themselves in upon release from prison. With little or no support coming out of prison, it shouldn't be surprising that many formerly incarcerated men and women end up in shelters or homeless, and eventually back in the criminal justice system. But, when returning citizens are connected to community-based re-entry services - such as safe housing, a stable job, addiction treatment, mental health care and case management - their likelihood of returning to the criminal justice system is reduced by up to 25 percent. We have seen firsthand the transformational impacts of community-based reentry programs, from our immediate family members to the men and women returning to their communities post-incarceration. Funding quality reentry programs is a sure way to decrease recidivism, improve public safety in our neighborhoods, and help the formerly incarcerated to rebuild their lives. Sadly, the availability of these programs and resources have been cut to shreds. In the last 18 months, four programs in Boston that provided community-based reentry services have either closed or scaled back due to loss of funding, including McGrath House, the only residential reentry program specifically for women. Overcoming The Odds, a city, state and community partnership with an exceptional success rate, ended in 2016 after three years of providing housing and case management to high-risk individuals returning to the Boston area. And, now, Brooke House, a 65-bed halfway house in the Fenway, is in jeopardy of closing this June after over 50 years of operation in Boston. Even the Boston Reentry Initiative - a program that has produced a 50 percent drop in recidivism for those deemed 100 percent likely to re-offend - has faced drastic reductions in its scope of services. Reentry programs depend primarily on federal grants and charitable donations, which can disappear almost overnight. While lawmakers in Massachusetts vocalize a commitment to supporting returning citizens, our state has not substantially invested in residential reentry supports. In fact, the Commonwealth's $40 billion state budget includes just $90,000 for community-based residential reentry. That's the roughly the same amount it costs to incarcerate two people in state prison for a year. We need to do more. Approximately 3,000 individuals return to Boston from jail or prison each year, and a majority of them will return home to the neighborhoods we represent. They are our brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, and deserve the chance to rebuild their lives with their families here in Boston. But, the door to opportunity cannot be locked. Earlier this week we teamed up to hold a City Council hearing at the Suffolk County House of Correction to hear directly from those most impacted by these funding cuts: incarcerated and formerly-incarcerated men and women, and the people and organizations that provide them with reentry services. We are also joining a coalition of advocates, including Community Resources for Justice, to urge the Legislature to dedicate $5 million for community-based residential re-entry. This will provide funding for approximately 450 individuals to begin their reintegration back to the community with a fair shot: a bed to sleep in, help getting a job, health care, counseling and an ID card. By providing connections to housing, employment and recovery services for people who often have difficulty accessing them, we can strengthen our communities and make them safer, heathier and more vibrant for all of us. \"In the last 18 months, four programs in Boston that provided community-based reentry services have either closed or scaled back due to loss of funding.\"",

The Museum of Contemporary Native Arts, housed downtown in the Institute of AmericanIndian Arts, illustrates the wide spectrum of styles and media in the Native American art community. Through Jan. 27, 2019, M\u00e2\u201d\u00ac\u00e2\u2013\u2018CNA highlights a vibrant new mural by Rolande Souliere. Using syllabics from the Ojibway, Cree and Inuit languages, Souliere draws dynamic parallels between the shape of language and the geometric styles traditional to Southwestern art. For a historical overview of the area's artistic roots, the Museum of Indian Arts and Culture and the New Mexico Art Museum both have extensive collections featuring local artists. After building a foundation of knowledge at local institutions, it'll be time for lunch. Many local dining spots are known as much for their galleries as their food. Caf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9 Pasqual's, a resident favorite for breakfast, also serves as a bustling art market. Every inch of wall is covered with works, including paintings and lithographs by Oaxaca native Leovigildo Martinez. His colorful figure paintings allude to the fantastical style of Chagall, but with Central American symbolism. The most famous traditional-format galleries in Santa Fe line Canyon Road, a half-mile of high-end artworks somewhat akin to Boston's Newbury Street. But unlike the often-polarized Boston art market, these galleries attempt to make the art accessible to all. George Brugnone of GF Contemporary says Santa Fe galleries often work out payment plans with patrons who otherwise couldn't afford to take an art piece home. There's less of an investment attitude toward art, and more of a passion for process. A slower pace The art tour doesn't end even when visitors turn in for the night. La Fonda on the Plaza, the oldest hotel in Santa Fe, with roots dating back to 1607, boasts an art collection of over 750 unique pieces. Docents provide detailed art and history tours around the hotel daily. A five-minute drive from the center of town sits Hotel Santa Fe, the only Native American-owned hotel in the city. The art and artifact collection focuses specifically on Native American work and features many items from the Picuris Pueblo who founded and continue to run the property. Santa Fe offers a refreshing change from the money- and fame-driven art world visitors find in cities like New York, Miami and Los Angeles. Just like life, art is slowed down in the Southwest. The artistic culture is about process, tradition and accessibility. And no matter where you go in 'The City Different,' your journey will be better, and more beautiful, for it.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Tucker is a Boston native and has lived in Dorchester, Hyde Park and Mattapan. \"Much of my perception of representation comes from what I've seen and heard here in Boston,\" he says. His three large-scale portraits in the show depict female friends and family members in different styles. Tucker says he's in an experimental period where he's discovering different manipulations of paint and canvas to render his subjects. Despite his exploration of technique, Tucker feels the subject is paramount. He interviews his sitters at length before painting them, believing that the more he knows, the better he can capture them. Cotard's portraits also spring from a personal place. Born and raised in Haiti, Cotard recently discovered he's related to a female political leader who worked closely with a dictatorship. His \"Portraits & Power\" pieces feature his sister and grandmother, and he uses the process of painting female figures he knows and loves to reconcile with this personal discovery. \"The point of all the portraits is to show the power women have,\" says Cotard. \"I want the viewer to think, 'How do I interact with this portrait?' and 'How do I interact with people of color?'\" Cotard paints on fabric, because he believes it connects him to the artist who made the fabric, adding another layer onto the work's artistic history. The portrait of his grandmother is painted on cloth he brought back from Haiti, the same fabric that his childhood school uniform was made of. For both artists, engagement with the viewer is essential. Their subjects stare out from the canvas, locking eyes with spectators, demanding they be seen. \"My need to make such large portraits and render the form in such a dominant way comes from the lack of representation of the black experience,\" says Tucker. \"You're in the subject's space, not the other way around.\" Cotard's figures, too, refuse to back down in deference to the viewer. They are strong, they are present and they will be acknowledged. On Friday, April 6, both artists will be present at the exhibition's closing reception at Sherrill Library in Cambridge beginning at 6 p.m. ON THE WEB For more information about the exhibition and artists, visit: https://lesley.edu/events/portraits-power",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"To have that urban wild space in the city alongside the energy of the people makes it a very inspiring place to live,\" says Radin about her neighborhood. Last year, Radin had an exhibition of landscapes at the Emerald Necklace Conservancy's Shattuck Visitor Center. That exhibit revealed the pensive, peaceful side of Boston, the still greenery and abandoned urban gardens in the early mornings and quiet of dusk. Celebrating daily life \"Landscapes and Streetscapes of Jamaica Plain\" reveals quite a different side of the historic Boston neighborhood. The landscapes no longer imply the otherworldly landscapes of a Fragonard painting, but the backyards of Jamaica Plain's vibrant resident community. The men unloading fruit at a street stand might play a pickup basketball game there later, walking the same paths as the energetic morning joggers and mothers with their children. The exhibition is a daily reminder for S\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b1nchez of the people and the place he advocates for. Though Jamaica Plain is a greatly changed area, evolving in economics and population through gentrification, Radin says the heart of the neighborhood remains the same. This exhibit serves to celebrate the longstanding camaraderie of the area, rather than to illustrate its changes. \"Despite the divisive political climate in the country, there are values that many people in this community share as far as welcoming people of all cultures and backgrounds,\" says Radin. \"My work has always set out to celebrate that diversity.\" True to this, the figurative photographs highlight Jamaica Plain's black and Latino populations, not as a political statement but as a truthful capture of the local community. New perspective In her 35 years as a Jamaica Plain-based photographer, Radin has seen the neighborhood at its best and its worst. She says that while some photographers draw inspiration from travel, the many faces of her beloved neighborhood are enough to ignite her passion. She says, \"I'm hoping that after people see my work they'll think, 'Wow, I never saw that place in that way before.'\" IF YOU GO The \"Landscapes and Streetscapes of Jamaica Plain\" show is on view by appointment. To arrange a viewing, call Ryan Manganelli, legislative aide for Rep. Jeffrey S\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b1nchez, at (617) 722-2990, or Robin Radin at (617) 312-2882.

      "body": "FULL TEXT When Dr. King acted, when he led, he showed what was possible. Here's one example: The black-white wealth gap has existed for as long as we've measured it. It is a measure of the persistent racism that kept black families from building a future. But the civil rights movement showed that real change was possible. The new laws passed opened up economic opportunities for African Americans. And it mattered. From the mid-1960s to 1980, the black-white wealth gap shrunk by 30 percent. It was because of Dr. King, and the many others who were called to action, that laws were changed and we started to see progress. Dr. King showed what was possible. He took action - and he helped make change. But as Dr. King noted, \"human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable...Every step toward the goal ofjustice requires sacrifice, suffering and struggle.\" And so it has been with our efforts since Dr. King's death. As America's commitment to expanding opportunity began to wane, injustice began to reassert itself. Tax cuts for the wealthy won out over investments in educating our children. A criminal justice system destroyed families and whole communities. A banking industry was turned loose to prey on communities of color. Black families were targeted for deceptive mortgages and payday lending. In one generation, from 1980 until today, the black-white wealth gap has tripled. Voting rights are under attack. The criminal justice system disproportionately incarcerates black and brown citizens. Violence against black men and women has not disappeared, and they disproportionately die at the hands of those sworn to protect them. We remember their stories. We say their names. Sandra Bland. Freddie Gray. Michael Brown. Stephon Clark. And countless others. Fifty years after Dr. King was gunned down, and now, we face another moment of challenge. We are called to act. Like Dr. King and those countless other unsung heroes, we must meet every challenge, not only with a good heart, but with a determination to take action and an unshakable faith that we will overcome. In the words of Dr. King, \"if the American dream is to be a reality, we must work to make it a reality and realize the urgency of the moment. And we must say now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.\" We will fight to end voter suppression. We will fight for working families - to make childcare available, to make college affordable, to increase the minimum wage, to lower health care costs, and to fight back against big banks that prey on their customers. We will fight to end the epidemic of mass incarceration that destroys people, families, and communities, and we will demand equal justice for all. We will fight to protect the lives of 800,000 Dreamers and hundreds of thousands more from Haiti and El Salvador and Nicaragua with Temporary Protected Status. We will say, loud and clear, that black lives matter. And when a racist bully talks about people who march with white supremacists and Nazis as \"very fine people,\" we will fight back. When he refers to countries in Africa with disgusting language, we will fight back. And when he uses hateful rhetoric to push discrimination in America - you better believe we will fight back. We will fight for justice, for opportunity, for equality for all. It is up to us to answer Dr. King's charge to make the American Dream a reality, to make real the promises of democracy, to take back our country. Not just for wealthy and the powerful, but for all people, for the least of these. Elected in 2012, Elizabeth Warren serves as U.S. senator from Massachusetts.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT As the first home of a Fra Angelico in America, the Gardner is a worthy host for this spectacular exhibition. Curator Nathaniel Silver edited its handsome catalog, with essays by 11 contributors and in-depth articles on each work, most written by Silver. In 1899, Isabella Stewart Gardner acquired her Fra Angelico, entitled \"The Dormition and Assumption of the Virgin.\" It is one of four reliquaries - displays that hold sacred relics - painted by Fra Angelico between 1424 and 1434 for the church of Santa Maria Novella, one of the Dominican edifices in Florence that displayed many of his works. Each venerates the Virgin Mary, a patron and protector of the Dominican Order. The other three are housed at the Museo di San Marco in Florence, next to the Convento di San Marco, where, while a resident, the friar painted frescoes on the walls of the monks' cells. Newly restored, all four reliquaries are reunited for the first time in centuries in this exhibition, displayed side-by-side on temporary walls that evoke their original setting, a church sacristy, where a priest prepares for mass. Angelic style Function and aesthetic appeal unite in the works by Fra Angelico, which inspire intimate encounters with the sublime and also render Bible stories and parables for edification in an era when literacy was reserved for an educated few. Fra Angelico (about 13951455), born Guido di Pietro, was raised near Florence. He and his brother were groomed for lucrative professions: his brother trained as a scribe, while he learned to illuminate books, mastering art of the miniaturist, which he later displayed by crafting images abundant in splendid, revelatory details. Both men chose to become friars and entered the Dominican Order. After his death, the Dominicans anointed the artist \"angelic,\" singling him out as one of its illustrious members, a circle that includes Thomas Aquinas, scholar and saint. In 1982, Pope John Paul II further exalted Fra Angelico with beatification, a step toward sainthood. Yet Fra Angelico's artistry speaks for itself. His images conjure a sensory experience of paradise, and make masterful use of glistening, combed gold in the service of spiritual uplift. They are equally faithful to physical reality, rendering Bible stories, parables and legends with great immediacy in warm earth tones of richly layered egg tempera paint. His visions of Paradise celebrate the Tuscan countryside, a paradise on earth with its spring flowers and green hills familiar to visitors of Feisole, a picturesque hill town on the fringe of Florence where he served for a time as prior of a small Dominican residence. Rendering the interactions of Jesus and Mary with great tenderness, Fra Angelico portrays their figures as sources of shimmering light. Let there be light The Gardner reliquary is visible as never before in this exhibition, not only because of its eye-level placement and superb lighting, but also thanks to the Gardner conservators, who removed modifications by previous owners, including dark clouds and a squared-off frame. Described with the intensity of a detective story, a catalog essay details the process and what it revealed about the techniques of Fra Angelico as he applied gold leaf and egg tempera layers to a sheet of poplar with delicate, precise strokes, the better to render \"the curls of saints' beards, the crow's feet on their faces and the strings on the angel's viola.\" The image employs gold on gold in gorgeous geometric patterns to render Mary's funeral bier and the glittering host of angelic musicians welcoming her ascent, and also portrays the eye-to-eye exchange of the apostles as they bear the weight of her body. The dual magnets of human drama and sublime beauty are also at play in the exhibition's first gallery, which offers a sampling of the settings in which Fra Angelico's works were viewed in churches and in home chapels of wealthy patrons. The seven works include a triptych, a three-part image for private devotion; and altarpieces that stood behind an altar and were visible to the congregation. The predella, the base of an altarpiece, was also laden with detailed images. A newly restored altarpiece on public display for the first time in four decades is \"The Entombment of Christ\" (about 1450), from the National Gallery of Art. Set in a Tuscan river valley, this spare and evocative image includes scenes before and after the death of Christ, including the garden of Gethsemane, the hillside with the three crosses and the open tomb. The magnificent altarpiece \"Paradise\" (1431-35), from the Gallerie degli Uffizi, Florence, is a perpetual visual prayer. Christ and Mary stand in an orb of dazzling light, surrounded by 85 figures, all, like them, adorned with jeweled haloes. Angels dance, sing and play trumpets, lutes and wind organs above a host of saints. Yet in this dense human assembly, no two look the same. Fra Angelico endows each saint with a distinct portrait. Mary Magdalene is carrying her jar of ointments with which she bathed the feet of Jesus. Saint Giles, patron of healing, is attired in his jeweled miter and holds his staff, as prior of the church of Sant'Egidio, the original setting of \"Paradise.\" Mary and Joseph A predella of this altarpiece, \"The Marriage of the Virgin,\" shows the wedding of a youthful Mary and aged Joseph - the only figures in the image with haloes and joyful faces - and also the contest leading up to their marriage. The high priest has ordered each of Mary's many suitors to break a branch, decreeing that the one whose branch blooms will be her spouse. Demonstrating the timeless power of Fra Angelico to engage an audience, two teenagers were captivated by the scene and its slapstick element: irate young suitors are shown striking Joseph's back as he weds Mary. Addressing the disappointed young men in the picture, one of the teenagers says, \"It's just not your day.\" ON THE WEB For more information about \"Fra Angelico: Heaven on Earth,\" visit: www.gardnermuseum.org/calendar/exhibition/fra-angelico",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Though contemporary women may not be able to call up a crucified female Pope from the middle ages or a Japanese concubine turned Buddhist nun for a glass of wine, the underlying issues of sacrifice, unfulfillment and lack of acceptance ring unnervingly relatable. Strong cast The diverse cast and guiding hand of South African director Liesl Tommy bring an additional layer of meaning to the show's theme of rising up. Tommy says the play's content allowed her to cast actors of color in roles that historically may have been white. \"I don't think this play is about whiteness, I think it's about women,\" she says. In a rehearsal two weeks ago, Tommy told an anecdote about her work at the Sundance East Africa Theatre Director's Lab wherein a white man blamed her for not informing him that the African directors could carry on intelligent conversations. She used this dually racial and gendered anecdote to further a group discussion of why the characters make the decisions they do. Jamaica Plain native Carmen Zilles, who plays Marlene, says she's drawn much of her inspiration for Marlene's strong, confident character from watching Tommy direct. Marlene comes from a working class background and has sacrificed substantially in other areas to become wealthy, and to distance herself from her lower class roots. Through this dynamic, economics play a large role in the play. Caryl Churchill wrote \"Top Girls\" in 1982 as a critique of Margaret Thatcher's leadership, but Tommy says it's only become more important with age. \"So many young people, and this transcends class, are questioning the capitalist system,\" says Tommy. \"Caryl Churchill was questioning that when we were in the rawest state of capitalism.\" Double identity Zilles draws a parallel between Marlene's dual upper and lower class identity and the actress's own experience as a Latina in America. For Zilles, she's one person at home with her mother in Mexico, and another working as an actress in New York City. She applies this double identity to her portrayal of Marlene, and indeed, the diversity of the cast brings additional complexity to the discussion of womanhood and socioeconomic status. Climbing the ladder of power as a woman is a brutal and sometimes unrewarding task, whether in 500 A.D. or 2018. And no matter what time period, the climb is easier with the kinship of women who have been there.

      "body": "FULL TEXT The open-air museum features more than 50 large-scale murals within a three block radius. Eighteen world renowned street artists and 20 local artists contributed and the collection is continually growing. Karrie Brawn, a Salem-based abstract artist whose mural is on Peabody Street, says the project was a great way to get artists out of their studios and working together. While many of the works are created with spray paint, Brawn used her typical acrylic paints on the concrete surface. \"Art doesn't have a set of rules,\" she says. \"It's a bridge to bring people together from all walks oflife.\" Rapid growth Two major characteristics set Punto Urban Art Museum apart from similar public art initiatives. The first is scale. The museum has exploded since its genesis two years ago with a crosswalk mural collaboration with Dominican artist Ruben Ubiera, who came of age in El Punto. In 2017 alone, 27 murals were added to the museum. This rapid-fire growth is in part due to wall access. North Shore CDC owns 50 buildings in El Punto, which means 50 walls worth of art space. The second standout feature of the museum is its commitment to El Punto's culture. Often public art signals the start of gentrification. A crucial part of the museum's mission is to maintain the current residents' living space while beautifying the neighborhood and bringing economic opportunities to immigrant owned businesses through foot traffic. Every single mural in the museum's catalogue is on or adjacent to rent restricted buildings. In an informational video about the project, Mickey Northcutt, CEO of North Shore CDC says, \"If we can create this really beautiful, innovative district and debunk that myth that a neighborhood is negative, then hopefully it will make folks think about whether their perceptions of the people that live there are also a bit of a myth.\" Positioning this enormous treasure trove of urban art amidst one of New England's most historic, Puritan cities, illustrates how the past and present can merge to create a brighter, more equitable future.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT There is a wealth of research to show the positive impact that a diverse teaching force has on achievement for students of color - including higher test scores, fewer suspensions, and increased graduation rates. Take the Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester as an example. When you walk down the halls of the Burke, you can't help noticing the highly diverse teaching staff, especially men of color. The Burke is the first school in Massachusetts history to move out of Turnaround Status with the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and the school also won the distinguished School on the Move prize by Edvestors. Burke Headmaster Linda McIntyre values diversity at the core of her school improvement strategy. Of her 29 teachers, 55 percent are black and Latino. By comparison, Brighton High School, which last year fell to Level 4 Turnaround Status, has a student body that is 91 percent students of color, while 69 percent of its teachers are white. The district has created a list of 20 \"Diversity Focus Schools\" which have failed to make real progress towards increasing teacher diversity. These schools receive heightened support and scrutiny from the Office of Human Capital. Not surprisingly, Brighton High is on this list. To be sure, there is a pervasive pipeline issue in urban school systems nationwide, and Boston is not the only district plagued with a shortage of teachers of color. We need more black and Latino students moving into the teaching profession. But diversity never happens by accident. It has to be intentional. This point was driven home by the BostonNAACP, Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, Black Educators Alliance of Massachusetts, and other civil rights groups in their recent paper called \"Broken Promises: Teacher Diversity in Boston Public Schools.\" Their report points out that back in the '70s, the court desegregation order that brought busing also included a mandate to increase the level of black teachers in Boston. Significant progress was made back then. But in the past 20 years, progress has stalled. The Task Force is closely monitoring the district's new pipeline programs and recruitment efforts aimed at fueling the number of diverse applicants. But today, schools have greater autonomy than they did in the '70s, which means principals are driven much more by their values than by mandates coming from central office. The buck stops with our school principals, who are on the front line of all hiring decisions. Ultimately, it's our principals who demonstrate their values by who they hire and don't hire. As an African American and former Boston teacher myself, I often have the pleasure of bumping into my former students, three of which are now working in the district. Through hugs and tears, they each tell me they went into education because they loved having me as their fifth grade teacher. It's humbling and rewarding to know I was the inspiration for these bright young women of color to enter the teaching profession. Clearly, one of the fastest ways to curb the diverse teacher shortage and fuel the pipeline is to ensure that black children grow up with Black teachers who they can admire and one day emulate. Ayele Shakur is co-chair, of the Opportunity and Achievement Gaps Task Force, and regional executive director of BUILD - Greater Boston. The 2016 Opportunity and Achievement Gaps Policy for the Boston Public Schools was created to eliminate disparities in academic attainment for students of color, English language learners, students with disabilities, and students of low socio-economic status. Diversity never happens by accident. It has to be intentional.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT  Attorney Michael Curry was recently promoted to Senior Vice President and General Counsel for the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers (the Mass League), which represents over 50 community health centers and over 988,000 patients across the state. Curry began his career with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, where he worked for 16 years, including 10 years in the company's Corporate Affairs Division. In 2008 he joined the Mass League, responsible for state and federal legislative affairs. His promotion came as part of a major restructuring of the nonprofit. He now leads the newly formed Government Affairs and Public Policy Division. Curry is also the Immediate Past President of the Boston NAACP and member of the National NAACP's Board of Directors and its Executive Committee. He currently serves on the boards of the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center and the Massachusetts Non-profit Network. He is a frequent guest commentator on WBUR's Radio Boston, Boston Public Radio WGBH with Jim Braude and Margery Eagan, and New England Cable News' (NECN's) The Take with Sue O'Connell. Community health centers were born out of the Modern Civil Rights over 52 years ago with the founding of the first two community health centers in the nation in the Columbia Point section of Dorchester and Mound Bayou, Mississippi. Community health centers have remained committed to their mission of providing accessible, affordable and high-quality health care for all. As a child growing up in Lenox Street Housing Development, Curry received his care at Whittier Street Neighborhood Health Center, and later at Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center. He often says, \"Where I'm from keeps where I am in perspective.\"",

Referred to by his nominator as \"a community treasure,\" under John Cruz's direction, the company has been a leader in construction, real estate development, property management, and giving back to the community through its nonprofit, Cruz C.A.R.E.S. The firm employs approximately 75 individuals, of which 90 percent are people of color. Cruz Companies' MBE contractor participation rate is as high as 82 percent, serving as an industry leader in diversity and inclusion; and recognized by organizations like the NAACP and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice. Headquartered in Roxbury and founded in 1948 by John's dad, John B. Cruz, Jr., this third-generation, family-owned firm is celebrating its 70th year in business. \"MWPC recognizes that the goal of equal representation for women can only be achieved through the combined efforts of men and women alike. We are honored to celebrate John for his incredible achievements in building communities, diversity & inclusion, and empowering communities across greater Boston,\" said MWPC Board President Gail Jackson-Blount. \"As the largest minority-owned construction company in the Northeast, Cruz Companies' commitment to hiring a diverse staff of high-level executives, women in the construction trades, and young people in the field has made it a champion of racial and gender equality in both the economic and social spheres.\" This year's event will be held on Thursday May 3, 2018 at 6:00PM at the Omni Parker House in Boston.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The rule had been the most significant progress in federal fair housing policy in the past fifty years. It required municipalities receiving HUD funding to engage with their residents and create local strategies to address disparities by race, family status, disability, and other characteristics in access to quality schools, proximity to employment, access to transportation, and exposure to environmental hazards. And it created hope for finally realizing the promise of the Fair Housing Act. In Boston, dozens of community groups from all over the city - including the Chinese Progressive Association, Mattapan United, the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, the Boston Branch of the NAACP, Metro Housing Boston, the Fair Housing Center of Greater Boston, Homes for Families, and others - helped organize community engagement meetings from Mattapan to Charlestown, East Boston to Chinatown. Before Boston could submit its Assessment of Fair Housing, however, HUD in January suspended the rule and informed cities that it would no longer review these local strategies to address inequality of access to opportunity. HUD effectively told Boston and similar cities that it no longer cared about the months or years of work the cities had put into their plans to address segregation. We recently interviewed a number of the participants in these meetings to get their thoughts on the process. A Boston tenant and staff member of the Boston Tenant Coalition, Kadineyse Paz, remembered the first of those meetings, when she was surprised to come inside from a downpour to find \"a huge crowd of Boston residents - the elderly, young folks, a real diversity of people excited to speak their voice and describe the challenges they are facing in their homes and neighborhoods.\" People described having issues finding a home because rents were increasing,\" she said, \"but also things I hadn't expected, such as being rejected from an apartment because of a disability, or because of being a family with small children.\" Dwaign Tyndall from Alternatives for Community and Environment noted that, \"What's radical about this Assessment of Fair Housing is for citizens to be able to participate in the planning process,\" and that \"the consistent emphasis from participants was on the need for more affordable housing and better access to transit, as well as concern about worsening segregation by race and by income as housing prices rise.\" From Philadelphia to New Orleans to Seattle, cities large and small have used the Assessment of Fair Housing process as an opportunity to confront the history of segregation in their communities. In the majority of submissions before the suspension, cities developed more robust plans to advance fair housing than they had previously: from deeply segregated New Orleans, which committed to using public land for affordable housing in neighborhoods with high-performing schools; to suburbs like Chester County Pennsylvania which committed to reduce the number of housing choice voucher holders living in concentrated poverty; to municipalities in the Kansas City region working collaboratively across municipal and state lines to create a regional plan to address disparities in access to opportunity. From climate change to immigration to fair housing, progress increasingly depends on bold action from our cities and states. In that spirit, the City of Boston has responded by pledging to continue to complete and to implement its fair housing plan. As we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, other cities should follow their lead and make good on the Fair Housing Act's original promise to take meaningful steps to reduce segregation in our communities.",

The two friends made an offer to the landlord for the retail space at 501B Washington Street, pitching their cafe idea. \"I stayed up that night putting together a menu and we submitted it to the landlord,\" Cupid says. The space had previously been occupied by an eyebrow threading place, which only lasted about six months, according to Cupid. With her and Wood's experience in the construction industry, they were able to remodel the retail space from scratch, with their own hands. The co-owners had to invest in new kitchen equipment, although there was no need for a full kitchen for the type of food products they make. \"It was a big green empty box when we got here,\" she says. But now, the cafe is outfitted with works of art by local artists on the wall, cozy reclining seats and tables, an open-concept kitchen in the lower level and a prepping station on the main level with refrigerators, blenders, panini press and, most recently, a new rice cooker. \"Our old one [rice cooker] was too huge,\" says Cupid. \"If you look in our display fridge, there are only a couple items because we try to make our food as fresh as possible.\" She continues, \"We got a smaller rice cooker so we can cook in smaller batches and maintain the consistency and freshness of the rice.\" Locally sourced With four part-time workers, the coffee, juices, smoothies and sandwiches are made in-house. The pastries are from bakeries in Malden and West Roxbury, the coffee is sourced from the Cape, the cold brew and nitro from New Hampshire, and during the summer, the kale, carrots and spinach for the smoothies are sourced from the Urban Farming Institute in Roxbury. \"We both don't come from culinary backgrounds so we had to learn on the fly,\" says Wood. \"We're foodies, we eat a lot of different food, but we had to learn how to operate a kitchen, make it flow, prep food, label ... getting down to the details.\" Wood says the permitting process took a long time to complete. \"When you start up a business you just have to be aware that the way you think it's going to go in your head is definitely not going to happen that way,\" says Cupid. The cafe's new rice cooker will be used to make an upcoming menu item: soul bowls. Suggested by a customer, they will consist of steamed rice and vegetables with creative spices. Wood and Cupid say they try to incorporate customer input as much as they can, from the menu to hosting community events and down to the background music selection. \"We really listen to our community and linked that to the structure of our business and how it operates and how we build it,\" says Cupid. If fresh healthy food options are the hook, then community events are the soul of the Juice and Jazz business. \"We have the coolest events ever,\" says Cupid. \"One of our favorite customers gave a workshop on currency trading here, we have a book club that meets four times a year and poetry nights. A lot of fun stuff happens here.\" Wood says, \"We're trying to focus on having more community events because it's not our cafe, it's the community's cafe. The people can be involved in it as much as possible.\" For Cupid, hosting events at the cafe gives her and her 7-year-old son something to do in the neighborhood too. \"There's not a lot that happens around here and when we had our paint party on Sunday, it was a great idea for a rainy Sunday afternoon where you didn't have to go so far for,\" she says. Wood and Cupid say they don't have a particular target market, and that they get customers by word of mouth and from all over the Greater Boston area. \"Sometimes we get an entire jury on their break, or it's two in the afternoon and it's jam packed with people from the community,\" says Cupid. Serving healthier food options has no doubt had an effect on the co-owners' diets as well. Wood says he has been a vegetarian for eight months now. \"Since we taste everything before we sell it, we decided to eat more like a vegetarian so we would know what a typical person on a plantbased diet would enjoy,\" says Cupid. \"Because your palate changes when you switch your diet.\" She jokes, \"So we would have been back here, throwing way too much salt on everything.\" Luckily, customers won't have to worry about this when they walk into Juice and Jazz. When you start up a business you just have to be aware that the way you think it's going to go in your head is definitely not going to happen that way.\" - Kajaal Cupid ON THE WEB For more information about Juice and Jazz Cafe, visit: http://juiceandjazzcafe.business. site or www.facebook.com/JuiceandJazzCafe/",

As a Dorchester resident for 30-plus years, Stan has a knowledge and passion for the Dorchester community. He has a strong background in nonprofits, and has worked in public health for over 15 years, where he founded a fatherhood program that continues to help men from low- to no-income families take part in their child's life.

He also worked with a variety of Boston nonprofits as an accounting consultant. As a previous Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center board member, he served in the roles of treasurer and then chairperson.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Today, OneUnited has grown to become the largest blackowned bank and first black internet bank in the country. Tri-State Bank has also grown over the years as it continues to serve the black community of Greater Memphis. And Mechanic & Farmers of North Carolina, the oldest black bank, is celebrating its 111th anniversary. In honor of the late Dr. King, and his legacy and visionary leadership, we reflect on his call for a \"bank-in\" movement as we are inspired by the activism of millennials and the #BankBlack movement. When Unity Bank was founded in 1968, there were 14,000 commercial banks in the U.S., of which only 20 were black-controlled. Established to give equal economic opportunity to the black residents of Roxbury and Dorchester, Massachusetts, Unity Bank embarked on this journey with the slogan, \"The Bank with a Purpose!\" It provided free seminars on consumer education, investments, credit and how banking works. Unity Bank was conceived by John T. Hayden, a black graduate of Harvard Business School and organized by the late Donald E. Sneed, Chairman and President, Marvin E. Gilmore, Vice President, and C. Bernard Fulp, Assistant Vice President and Chief Loan Officer. Fulp, who previously worked at two large banks in Boston and saw firsthand the discriminatory policies of banks including redlining, stated, \"Place of residency is given more weight than any other factor when commercial banks grant loans. Slum residents are eliminated solely on the basis of where they live. This drives those who can least afford it to finance companies and loan sharks who charge unreasonable interest.\" Unity Bank was founded to change all of that. Although progress has been slow, there continues to be hope and opportunity inspired by the #BankBlack and #BuyBlack movements and supported by the internet and advancements in technology. The black community has begun to focus on Dr. King's economic message by recognizing the power of its $1.2 trillion in annual spending to build generational wealth. Black banks and credit unions are proud to be at the forefront of this burgeoning understanding of the power of \"collective economics.\" Nearly 50 years later, OneUnited Bank continues the legacy of Unity Bank, including its mission to be \"The Bank with a Purpose.\" OneUnited became the first black interstate bank, expanding beyond Boston by acquiring banks in Miami and Los Angeles. The bank received a designation as a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) by the U.S. Department of Treasury and loaned over $2 billion to communities that are over 70 percent or more minority and low to moderate income, including Roxbury, Dorchester, Liberty City, South Central and Compton. The bank launched an internet bank in 2005 with mobile banking and 25,000 surcharge-free ATMs and built an exciting online community through social media. OneUnited Bank is \"unapologetically black.\" The bank continues to focus on financial literacy and, importantly, advocates for economic and social justice including supporting #BlackLivesMatter. After 50 years, the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lives on through the legacy of Unity Bank and Trust, the current work of OneUnited Bank and all black banks. We are honored to carry the torch ... and recognize the importance of passing the baton from \"bank in\" to #BankBlack. Teri Williams is chief operating officer of OneUnited Bank. \"Nearly 50 years later, OneUnited Bank continues the legacy of Unity Bank, including its mission to be 'The Bank with a Purpose.'\"",

She was surprised to find that many others in Boston's Haitian community had been questioned about their background. \"Almost everyone I photographed had a similar story, a similar experience,\" she says. Her subjects wear simple black and dark gray garments. Almost all the portraits are shot on a white backdrop, with a few on black. Each person engages directly with the camera, mostly unsmiling - not angry or confrontational, just living. Anselme clearly wields her camera with a natural talent. Not only are the images exquisite compositionally, it takes a great photographer to draw such natural poses from everyday subjects. Local roots Anselme grew up in Dorchester and Roslindale. \"I've been surrounded by the Haitian community my whole life,\" she says. Now studying graphic design and photography at Bridgewater State University, Anselme felt it was high time to celebrate her cultural roots. She has been publicizing the series and her work on Instagram, and in April, the photographer presented her project at the Boston Public Library's Hyde Park branch as part of ArtWeek. She hopes to have further opportunities to display the work. Anselme works out of a studio in Charlestown and shoots with a Nikon D610 camera. Her work can be seen on her website, and the most frequent updates on her projects can be seen on her Instagram (@anselmephotography). In addition to her series projects, she shoots portraits, fashion, music, photojournalism and commissions. She manages to infuse even the simplest of shots with emotional charge and otherworldly beauty. \"Faces of Haiti\" isn't the photographer's only series exploring black heritage. She's currently working on a project portraying her family members as Haitian royalty. The rich portraits, unlike the minimalism of the \"Faces of Haiti\" pieces, are laced with lush textiles and African symbolism. \"I've realized that a lot of my work has been about looking into my family's origins, about being Haitian and having African roots,\" she says. \"I think it's important to educate people about other cultures. It puts us at the forefront.\" ON THE WEB View Anselme's work online by visiting: www.anselmephotography.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Subjects for Coe's project run the gamut from activists and artists to policemen and social workers. Coe says people often surprise him once he gets to know them. \"I'm an African American man, I'm used to people sizing me up,\" he says. \"But I also love having my own misconceptions shattered.\" He recalls an afternoon when three young men downtown asked him for directions. They looked like average tourists, but as Coe began to chat with them and revealed he's a poet, one of the men abruptly recited \"Jabberwocky\" from memory. In \"What You Don't Know About Me,\" Coe seeks to reveal similar surprises in his subjects. This exhibit expands Coe's 2017 project as a Boston Artist in Residence. The BPL iteration contains several new panels and stories, including an original poem Coe wrote about the project. The exhibit imparts a special impact in Gallery J, situated at the heart of the newly renovated Johnson Building. Hundreds of people from all walks of life stroll through the library halls every day. Just like Coe's subjects, every library guest has a story. Coe hopes viewing the exhibit will cause people to think twice before making snap judgments about their fellow Bostonians. One panel features Yelena Piliavsky, a native Ukrainian, whose family fled to the United States in 1993. After her daughter had begun applying to colleges, Piliavsky was startled by a knock on the door. It was a Boston Globe reporter. Concerned they had done something wrong, Piliavsky asked what the reporter needed. They replied that her daughter had won a Rhodes Scholarship and the paper wanted to publish the story. Coe found his subjects by walking through Mission Hill and approaching people in local businesses. He found that while many people said they didn't have much of a story, his interviews with them were filled with rich anecdotes. By pairing the stories in panels designed by Noel Danforth with black-and-white portraits by Gordon Webster, Coe illustrates the cognitive dissonance between appearance and reality. \"Undermining misconceptions and stereotypes is the primary goal,\" says Coe. \"And with the way this country is going, that's even more important.\" ON THE WEB For more information about \"What You Don't Know About Me,\" and similar programming, visit: www.bpl.org",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Artist Akrobatik, a Dorchester native, participated on the planning committee and will attend the event on Saturday. Currently, Akrobatik performs with a collective called The Perceptionists and teaches a class on hip-hop history and culture at UMassBoston. \"Because hip-hop has only been around for 40 years, we have the ability to archive the whole scene,\" says Akrobatik. He's managed to whittle down his memorabilia to three major items: a flyer from a 1999 concert at the Middle East when he opened for Eminem, a photo from a 1990 stage performance and the cover art from his debut EP in 2000. The community gathering allows for a greater discussion, both about the artistry behind the hip-hop sound and the social oppressions that have kept the Boston movement down. This convention falls during the 20th annual HipHop Appreciation Week, May 14 to May 19, just a month after Kendrick Lamar's album \"Damn\" won the Pulitzer Prize. \"Show 'Em Watcha Got\" isn't just celebrating musical artists. Creators from every corner of the hiphop ecosystem, from graffiti artists to dancers, will be recognized. Rob Stull, an illustrator, comic book creator and owner of the Ink on Paper studio, was part of the Artists Without Limits group in 1983 Boston. The graffiti-crew-turned-art-production-company partnered with local area promoters to make artwork to advertise music, spoken word and dance. Stull plans to bring a flyer from a 1989 Shinehead concert, a flyer design from a Boogie Down Productions show and a jacket with a purple rose design from the '80s. Hip-hop emerged strongly among black and Latino communities in New York in the 1970s. Based on philosophical tenets like unity, wisdom and respect, hip-hop has always been and continues to be a tool for conflict resolution, community building and empowerment for young people in disadvantaged communities. National institutions have archived big-name artists of the genre, but for Boston in particular, the small-time community artists who weren't able to achieve fame in this environment are equally important to the history. In addition to the physical documentation, the storytelling is highly anticipated. Organizers hope a big crowd will come out from the community to share experiences and talk future progress. \"I think it's gonna be like a high school reunion, like a family reunion,\" says Akrobatik. \"We all have so much to catch up on.\" Running from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the library's central branch, the event is free and open to the public. Anyone interested in hiphop is welcome. ON THE WEB To learn more about the event, visit: http://blogs.umb.edu/archives/mass-memoriesroad-show/",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Director Daniel Boudreau says, \"We see it largely as a commentary on the way we live now, with this sense of hyper-individuality that in fact leads to feelings of isolation and destabilization.\" Camus' novel, published in 1947, was quickly utilized as an anti-Nazi allegory. One of the several poignant themes that resurfaces in \"The Plague,\" is that of propaganda. Particularly in the world of social media and the internet, media images exacerbating fear, anger and distrust are everywhere. Boudreau notes similar phenomena during American crises like Hurricane Katrina, when reports of looters and baby killers, which later proved to be false, worsened an already challenging situation. Now with fake news and unreliable sources everywhere, the role of media and information hits close to home. A rare outing Boudreau received permission from Bartlett to present \"The Plague.\" This is the only show being performed outside of Bartlett's own direction in London's West End. The expert cast includes, among others, Dayenne Walters, who directed and performed in Praxis Stage's recent production of \"For Colored Girls\"; Danny Mourino, a longtime Praxis talent; and Michael Rodriguez, recently seen in Flat Earth's \"Antigone.\" Praxis Stage has pushed an avant-garde theatre agenda since the group's inception in 2016. \"At Praxis Stage, we understand art, and particularly theater, as a powerful tool to resist and oppose such cultural political currents,\" says Boudreau, \"and also as an instrument that can break through fear and challenge the powerful's dominant narratives of collapse and combative-individualism.\" The performance splits between two venues. From May 11 to 20, the production runs at Dorchester Art Project, and from May 23 to 27, it's hosted by Boston Playwrights' Theatre. All seats are $20. The dual location promotes accessibility to theatre, a mission dear to Boudreau's heart, and also illustrates the transcendent message of the script. Not held down by heavy sets, costumes or time periods, the show could be performed anywhere, for anyone and carry a similar weight. Though sharp and analytical, the message of \"The Plague\" is ultimately optimistic. As Camus said, \"There is more to admire about people than to despise or despair of.\" ON THE WEB For more information, visit: www.praxisstage.com/",

The company operates all over Boston, but the main project sites have been in neighborhoods like Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan and the South End. Although increased development and construction in Boston has brought uncertainty for some residents, the activity has given Outkast more business. \"We get about 12 different contracts on a regular basis, but we get requests for bids from all kinds of projects,\" says Gray. \"Right now, there's so much work, we can pick and choose what we want to work on.\" The projects they choose usually depend on scheduling and how much manpower they have, says Gray. Outkast now has a total of 17 employees, including office administration staff and 13 electricians out in the field. According to Gray, Outkast is in the process of joining a local chapter in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union, \"for expansion opportunities, larger contracts and the opportunity to work on downtown projects.\" Other expansion strategies for the company include Outkast's partnership with Suffolk Construction and its enrollment in the Business Equity Initiative program with Eastern Bank. Gray says both programs have been essential in helping grow the business and receive mentorship. \"It's opened doors for us and we have been able to meet people we normally wouldn't meet,\" he says. Currently, Outkast is working on a $1.6 million contract project: the Marriott Residence Inn on Melnea Cass Boulevard. The new hotel is being built on the formerly vacant city lot, Parcel 9. We get about 12 different contracts on a regular basis, but we get requests for bids from all kinds of projects. Right now, there's so much work, we can pick and choose what we want to work on.\" - Paul Gray",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Ward's sculpted goats are a tribute of sorts to a humble, valued animal that is a source of food, a hard-working pack animal and an agile, daring climber. The trio at the deCordova stands on a grassy slope overlooking Sandy Pond. Their beguiling, gentle faces are smeared in paint, and plastic jewels shine in their foreheads. Ward has burdened each goat with urban debris. Spikes of rebar extend from their backs, which bear tall spires of such cast-off objects as a fire hose, shoe tips, and modem cords. In Jamaica, Ward has explained, rebar often protrudes from the rooftops of houses, so floors can be added to make room for a growing family. Somewhat comical and bizarre, Ward's fusion of rural and urban images evokes other odd juxtapositions in society, such as between haves and have-nots and insiders and outsiders. Entrances and exits On view on a nearby hill is an installation by another Brooklyn-based artist who fashions familiar objects of daily life into new forms that conjure realities beyond what meets the eye. Saul Melman's \"Best Of All Possible Worlds\" (2018), a commission for the deCordova's PLATFORM series of site-specific works, is a cluster of eight vacuum-molded casts made from the doors in his apartment. The group of translucent plastic replicas stands Stonehenge-like on the top of a hill. The artist has arranged the casts in the same locations that the doors occupy in his home, and he sited the installation along an east-west axis to capture the light of sunrise and sunset. An emergency room physician, Melman often creates works that explore transitions between states, such as between life and death. Here, his semi-transparent doors evoke entrances and exits of all kinds. His installation mingles the natural - sunlight in its moment-to-moment mutations - with the fixed material of his casts, which change with the light while remaining immobile objects. And mingling the physical and the ethereal, the installation, when viewed from a distance, appears to hover on the grassy knoll. Glinting in the sun, the translucent replicas are objects of interest in themselves and reward a closer look. Traces of paint and wood suggest the wear of daily life. One cast with gilded edges and elegant curved lines, evokes the old-world charm of the original door. Others are a set of rectangles, like found works of abstraction. Plenty more awaits visitors to the deCordova, a 35-acre sculpture park with more than 60 works as well as a contemporary art museum. Among the sculptures near the installations by Ward and Melman are Roxbury-born John Wilson's 1987 study for \"Eternal Presence\" (aka \"Big Head\"), the seven-foot high sculpture that stands at the National Center for Afro-American Artists in Boston; and DeWitt Godfrey's \"Lincoln\" (2012), a row of giant steel loops that tumbles down a hill. On June 21, the summer solstice, Melman will join visitors at the site of his work to observe the end of the longest day in the year. If the weather is clear, the setting sun will set his installation ablaze. ON THE WEB deCordova Sculpture Park and Museum: https://decordova.org/art/sculpture-park",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"The Founders Project comes out of a desire to both address the persistent lack of Pre-Colonial African Narratives in mainstream educational discourse and to create empowering visual representations of Boston's Black Youth,\" says Hamilton. Hamilton explains that in West and Central West African lore, the concept of the \"founder\" represents the physical embodiment of the people and their history. This provides a sharp contrast to the white, Eurocentric history taught in schools, in which the founder of a nation might be the man who stuck his flag on the land first. Through his process, Hamilton allows BPS students to physically become those founders and therefore to live and breathe the African history they stand for, even if only for a short time. \"The Black experience, as it's often represented, has been defined by misery, oppression and subordination, leading many to believe that our lives are, have always been and will forever be an ongoing cycle of denigration and suffering,\" says Hamilton. This project provides an opportunity to illustrate a positive history that's often ignored. With \"The Founders Project,\" Hamilton has created a fully illustrated companion syllabus interpreting represented iconography and drawing connections between African history and modern culture of the African diaspora. His partner, Now + There, is a public art organization that facilitates the creation of impactful, accessible public art in the greater Boston area. The Accelerator program provides artists with curatorial, technical and financial support to create new, temporary artworks each year. The team is still searching for the right space to install the exhibit in, but Hamilton says it's important to him that the space be accessible to the public. Updates can be found at @theartofstephenhamilton and #thefoundersproject on Instagram. Hamilton's artwork almost always has an educational tie teaching both artistic practices and African history. This passion comes from his first-hand experience of the lack of African history taught in schools. He found his cultural inspiration not in textbooks, but in art. \"Growing up in Roxbury, I was surrounded by the murals and paintings of artists such as Dana Chandler, Sharon Dunn and John Biggers. These artists dedicated their lives to creating artwork that made young black people see the beauty of our culture and heritage,\" he says. Now Hamilton carries on that legacy.

      "body": "FULL TEXT A Berklee graduate, Woodard has been leading the Fred Woodard Collective since 1988. In 2016, he decided to establish a jazz festival in Dorchester to bring music into his community. The Dudley Jazz Festival also aims to stoke an interest in jazz among young people, who may go on to carry the genre forward. Woodard says it was important to him to keep the festival in the Dorchester and Roxbury area. \"A lot of folks in the neighborhood haven't been exposed to jazz,\" says Woodard. \"When jazz musicians do come to town, they're not playing in this neighborhood.\" This is particularly poignant because of Roxbury's integral role in Boston's jazz history; many musicians got their start in neighborhood clubs. Harrell and Ford both have roots in Boston. When pianist and educator Ran Blake overheard Ford playing at a Boston nightclub, he encouraged him to study music at the New England Conservatory. In 1974, Ford joined the Duke Ellington Orchestra and went on to produce his own music. Coming full circle, Ford's latest release featured his former New England Conservatory teacher, Jaki Byard. Boston-based Lydia \"LovelySinger\" Harrell lives to perform jazz and soul. Since the age of 7 she's studied piano, clarinet and voice, and in 2007 performed with the Boston Pops. Further ingraining herself into the Boston landscape, Harrell sang the national anthem for the Celtics during both the 2009 and 2010 seasons. In addition to her solo performances, Harrell also teaches music and headlines a band that performs at events around New England. When Monte Croft was 10 he received a drum set for Christmas and immediately began making beats. At 14 he discovered the vibraphone, and the rest is musical history. Croft also cut his teeth at Berklee and performed at Boston area clubs before moving to New York. Most recently, Croft's work can be heard in the 2017 film \"The Greatest Showman\" starring Hugh Jackman. As the festival progresses, Woodard selects unique artists to bring a new sound to Dudley. \"Each year I'm trying to do something different,\" he says, \"so someone who's not acclimated to jazz can get involved.\" In the event of rain, the festival will be moved to the Bruce C. Bolling building in Roxbury at the same date and time.

John Barros, chief of economic development, said in a statement, \"By breaking down barriers, increasing access and opening doors to opportunities, expertise and networks, small businesses and entrepreneurs now have more resources to achieve their individual goals and be successful. I am eager to build on the success we have seen in Mattapan and East Boston, and look forward to working with all of the partners to assist small business in Roxbury and every neighborhood in the City of Boston.\" Taylor Connolly, communications manager for the Office of Economic Development, said outreach has been conducted by the mayor's office, the 20 Boston Main Street districts, and the city's Neighborhood Business Managers \"who are out in the neighborhoods, knocking on business doors and meeting small business owners to hand out flyers, contact information and registering people for workshops in person.\" In partnership with Boston Main Streets and local business support organizations and experts retained through the on-site business assistance program, the Small Business Centers in Mattapan and East Boston hosted close to 400 small business owners and entrepreneurs throughout 17 different workshops that covered topics including financial literacy, legal and leasing guidance and workshops for immigrant entrepreneurs. Public attendance According to city data, the majority of workshop attendees included food-based businesses and companies seeking contracting opportunities, as well as cooperative or employee-owned organizations. Workshops that saw the most attendees were focused on access to capital, tips for lean business planning and guidance on winning public contracts. Connolly said offering assistance specifically geared towards immigrant business owners is something the city is committed to doing. \"In the past, we have hosted workshops specifically designed for immigrant entrepreneurs that included success stories, best practices and available resources,\" said Connolly. \"At the Roxbury Small Business Center, each of our workshops have translation services and multilingual staff available to assist attendees.\" So far, the Roxbury Small Business Center has hosted two workshops. The first was on winning public contracts with the City of Boston and the second focused on construction bonding for federal contracts. According to Connolly, 40 attendees have visited the first two workshops and another 50 or more people are expected to come to the next one. The next four workshops will take place every Monday from June 4 through June 25 at the Bolling Building. They will inform participants on contracting with the City of Boston, how to start a food business, how to attract and keep customers and legal advice.

Writer and director Sandra Manzanares drew on her own experience as an Afro-Latina when making her film. \"Fine Like Silk\" follows a mother and daughter shopping at a black hair care store, speaking Spanish to each other. Their dual identities as both of African and Latina descent spark the unsettling interest of the Korean store proprietor. The daughter must act as a cultural translator to relieve the tensions of the conversation. \"Even when white people leave the room, white supremacy stays there, and that impacts how these communities interact with each other,\" says Manzanares. Having grown up in Mattapan, Manzanares hopes to illustrate that there are stories in Boston that take place outside of Newbury Street and Back Bay. On June 21 at the Museum of Fine Arts, the award winning film \"Liyana,\" produced by Thandie Newton of the HBO series \"Westworld,\" makes its Boston premiere. Woven in a stylistic mash-up of documentary and animation, the narrative follows five orphaned Swazi children who channel their trauma into creative energy. This opening night event will also feature the live storytelling of U-Meleni Mhlaba-Adebo and Valerie Stephens. Tickets for individual films and events are available, as are Gold passes, which grant access to all screenings, parties and events, and Silver passes, which grant access to screenings and panels. A full list of events and pass information can be found online. Since its inception, the festival has grown every year. In those 20 years, the festival has welcomed over 38,000 attendees and screened more than 600 films. It is now the largest festival in New England that celebrates people of color. \"I think it's important for everyone to see films about people of color across the world,\" says Simmons. \"It's a very different visual than what we're seeing in mainstream media. There are infinite narratives.\" I think it's important for everyone to see films about people of color across the world. It's a very different visual than what we're seeing in mainstream media. There are infinite narratives.\" - Lisa Simmons",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Next, she worked for three-anda-half years at Future Chefs, a nonprofit that uses food service training to help teens gain academic and professional skills. When Straughter learned last year that one ofthe Bruce C. Bolling Municipal Building's restaurant spaces, then occupied by Tasty Burger, was soon to be vacant, she jumped at the opportunity. \"When I walked through this space, I felt as though I could make this a restaurant that the community wanted and needed,\" she says. In opening Soleil in the Bolling Building, Straughter is returning both to the food business and to Dudley Square, a commercial district that figured prominently in her childhood. \"My mother loved Dudley,\" she said. \"We used to go to Woolworths. I remember riding the elevated train, going downtown.\" Straughter sees the bustle returning to the long-struggling district, with several entrepreneurs opening new restaurants in the area this year and Black Market, the weekend bazaar on Washington Street, drawing a diverse crowd of shoppers. \"I love Black Market,\" Straughter says. \"We are going to feed off of each other. It's great that people are interested in Dudley. There's a weave of energy and interest in Dudley\" Soleil's soft launch - a time period when the restaurant is open for business, but not publicized - was two weeks ago. Since then, Straughter and her nine employees have been tweaking the menu and improving the workflow. The food is a mixture of influences that Straughter says defies a label. \"Is it Southern cooking?\" she says. \"Some of it is. We have fried chicken. But we also have grilled salmon. Yesterday I made collard greens with kale. I have oven-roasted carrots with a honey glaze. It's not really Southern cooking, but it's a Southern thing with a twist.\" The food is all cooked from scratch, right down to the cranberry compote that goes into her sandwiches. Straughter avoids using canned or frozen foods, opting for fresh ingredients. \"There's a certain passion I have about food,\" she says. \"I really put my heart and soul into a meal.\" The restaurant In March, she began renovations in the space, doing much of the demolition and painting herself. The layout of the roughly L-shaped restaurant remains largely the same as when Tasty Burger first opened, but Straughter has made some significant changes. She took out two fryers and added in a grill, a charcoal broiler and an array of hot trays for entrees at the service counter. A salad bar is opposite the serving counter. Straughter added upholstery to the booths and ripped out a bench in the back section to create a bar. She has applied for a beer and wine license. At the far end of the restaurant, which protrudes into the lobby of the Bolling Building, she added tables and chairs from the Ester restaurant that closed recently in Lower Mills and added cushions. With several wide-screen televisions, the area is perfect for watching sports games, Straughter says. She financed the restaurant with savings and some help from the Department of Neighborhood Development's Small Business Center. In its first few days, Soleil has been busiest at breakfast and lunch times, she says. Straughter hopes a beer and wine license will help draw patrons in after 6 p.m., when Dudley has typically emptied out. When customers start staying after dark, Dudley's rebirth will be cemented, Straughter says. \"We have to create a destination point,\" she says. \"That's what this place is.\" There's a certain passion I have about food. I really put my heart and soul into a meal.\" - Cheryl Straughter ON THE WEB For more information about Soleil, visit: www.soleilboston.com Soleil owner Cheryl Straughter and her nine employees serve food cooked from scratch with fresh ingredients in the Dudley Square restaurant.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Savage grew up in Ahoskie, North Carolina, and graduated from Berklee with a degree in performance in 1984. He was hired to teach ear training in 1993, and over the next four years also taught in the percussion and ensemble departments. He was appointed chair of the ensemble department in 2000, and served in that role for 17 years, until his appointment as interim dean. While chair of the ensemble department, he significantly increased the musical diversity of ensemble offerings, including gypsy jazz, acoustic blues, neosoul, women in rock, heavy metal, reggae dub and many more. Earlier this year, he received the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drum Major for Community Service Award by the Cambridge, chapter of the NAACP. \"Ron has demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to music and music education through his 25 years as a faculty member and chair at Berklee,\" said Berklee President Roger H. Brown. \"He transformed the ensemble department as its chair, and will continue to lead the professional performance division with the same passion and drive that he brings to everything he does.\" Savage is an acclaimed drummer with a special focus on jazz and blues. He has performed extensively around the world with a wide array of performers including James Moody, Clark Terry, Curtis Fuller, Mulgrew Miller, Joe Zawinul, Nnenna Freelon, Vanessa Rubin, Sam Rivers and Albert King. Savage is also a passionate community advocate. He and his wife, Lois, founded the ALMI/Ron Savage Music Academy in 1999, which is committed to providing inner city youth with affordable music lessons and instruments. He serves on the board of the All-Dorchester Sports and Leadership program in Dorchester, Massachusetts. More recently, he founded the Cambridge Jazz Festival with Larry Ward.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Trenyce portrays Diana Ross in the musical-a role that she seems destined to play. She grew up in Memphis, Tennessee in a musical household (her parents were singers), with Motown providing a soundtrack to her family's life. She attended the University of Memphis on a full music scholarship, and later earned a spot in 2002 on season two of \"American Idol.\" For several years, Trenyce had been researching Diana Ross, examining what her voice sounded like and studying her interviews, in hopes of creating a one-woman \u00e2\u201d\u00ac\u00e2\u2022\u2013 show about the icon. The actress first I auditioned for the role of Ross while living and working in London, and was one of three finalists - but didn't get the part. Soon after, she left London for Los Angeles, and her new agent suggested she audition for the role. When she mentioned that she had already auditioned and hadn't gotten the part, her agent encouraged her to try again, saying, \"I think you'll make a great Diana.\" She auditioned, made it through the first round. On the second audition, Berry Gordy was there, and Trenyce landed the role. Meeting Gordy - the founder of Motown records and the writer of the musical - was a surreal moment for Trenyce, she says, taking her back to her childhood. \"I had grown up with Motown music in my household my entire life, the way that my family bonded on a Saturday or Sunday when we were cleaning. It was a way for us to have that family time,\" recalls the actress and singer. The essence of \"Motown The Musical\" is family. It chronicles the true story of Gordy, how he founded and grew the record label with the support ofhis four sisters, created an extended family of artists and musicians, and transformed the company into an empire that changed the fabric and the landscape of American music. In addition to the hit songs that people know and love, the show contains 90 characters, with most of the actors playing at least five or six characters each. \"We get to tell this amazing, iconic black people story,\" says Trenyce. BOSTON CONNECTION Dorchester's Quiana Holmes stars as Mary Wilson in the musical. For her, too, it seems that fate played a hand in bringing the Motown story into her orbit. In the spring of 2015, Holmes made her professional debut as Dorothy in Fiddlehead Theatre Company's production of \"The Wiz\" at the Strand Theatre. The following spring, she was cast as Diana Ross in \"Dancing in the Streets: Motown Revue Tour,\" a West End production. And in 2017, just two months after graduating from the Berklee College of Music, Holmes was on the road with \"MotownThe Musical.\" Everything seemed to happen so quickly, yet the actress had been preparing for this moment for a long time. Growing up in the small town of Rome, New York, Holmes, like Trenyce, been surrounded by music. Her mother, Beverly Holmes, was an evangelist and a biblical playwright who often incorporated her daughter in her productions. In high school, the budding actress was involved in several musical activities, from the symphony orchestra as first violin to the marching band as a pit member. In her professional debut in \"The Wiz,\" Holmes was able to work with a variety of actors. \"It was fantastic learning from them and being able to see how they managed their time, how they studied their lines, and how they got into character,\" she says. \"It was a steppingstone for me to see that firsthand because I was one of the younger people who were cast. That was an advantage for me.\" Holmes, who is still based in Boston, is thrilled to be part of this particular musical journey. She wants audiences to see, she says, \"that Motown is framing the message of unity and love, and that Berry Gordy has created the soundtrack of America.\" IF YOU GO Tickets for \"Motown The Musical\" can be purchased through Ticketmaster by calling 800.982.2787, by visiting www.BroadwayInBoston.com, or in person at the Boston Opera House Box Office, located at 539 Washington Street in Boston, Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"Ten years ago it was very hard to convince anyone that dance was related to climate change, for example,\" says Jose Mateo, founder of the festival. \"We're trying to take dance beyond its primary cultural role as performance for pleasure.\" The festival showcased over 90 performances on five stages, featuring everything from jazz and flamenco to West African styles and Benkadi drum and dance. The OrigiNation Cultural Arts Center, a nonprofit organization rooted in African influences, featured performances from children as young as 8, as well as teens and adults. Each group performed with unmatched vibrancy and enthusiasm. The festival space in Harvard Square also showcased Advocacy Way, a strip of booths offering information on advocacy groups, food vendors, children's activities and a post-festival dance party with DJ Sammy Smoove. Mateo recently made the significant decision to discontinue ballet performances by his company in favor of a greater focus on the Dance for World Community mission. \"I'm one of the few choreographers who's been able to produce new work every year, and I think it's time to invest those resources in something broader,\" says Mateo. With his dance company as well as the festival, Mateo's mission has always been to bring dance opportunities to a diverse group of people who are not always accepted, particularly in ballet. He hopes to grow the Dance for World Community mission with year-round programming and outreach. He's also working on ways to incorporate nontraditional dance into next year's festival. He says, \"There's a lot of dance that's more spontaneous, that's not deliberately organized. We'd love to showcase more of that in the festival.\" The company's annual presentations of \"The Nutcracker\" will still be hosted at the Cutler Majestic Theatre and the Strand Theatre. And the Jose Mateo Ballet Theatre will continue providing dance instruction for children, teens and adults at both its Cambridge campus and its new Dorchester studio. Mateo's instruction puts heavy emphasis on inclusion for all backgrounds, body types and styles. \"As in most classist societies, there's a real hierarchy as to who's important in dance,\" says Mateo. \"What we want to emphasize is that we're living in a multicultural society. We have to share cultural resources.\" ON THE WEB Jose Mateo Ballet Theatre: www.ballettheatre.org Dance for World Community Festival: http://www.danceforworldcommunity.org",

      "body": "FULL TEXT One of the reasons why I ran for office to begin with is because we, as a community, are not benefiting from the economic growth in our city. We see development happening in our neighborhood and throughout Boston, but communities of color have been largely left out of it. There are several development projects in Dudley Square that are underway and in the pipeline, and we need to be able to make informed decisions on what is happening in our community. We must have a process that is much more open, inclusive and transparent. Boston's housing and gentrification crisis is on the rise throughout our neighborhoods. Roxbury has recently seen units listed for over $700,000. While there is no \"silver bullet\" for our housing problems, there are actions that we can and must take in order to ensure that we can remain in our community. I'm fighting for affordable homeownership opportunities in our community that are accessible to people who live in Roxbury. We need to build homes that are truly affordable for Roxbury residents to buy and live in. Sometimes, there is a trade-off between a little bit more density and lower-cost units. Down-payment assistance programs can also help with this. I'm fighting for new ways to raise revenue dedicated to creating and maintaining affordable housing. This could be through a vacancy tax on unoccupied housing units, or a luxury tax on condos that sell for over $1 million. More funds are needed for the city to invest in making housing more affordable. I also want the city to increase the number of affordable housing units that developers are required to provide as part of building a market-rate project (known as \"inclusionary development units\") and increase the fees on those who do not provide it as another means of raising funds for affordable housing. Student housing is another factor that is driving up the cost of housing for long-term residents. I'm fighting to make sure that universities do their part and provide enough housing for their students, without taking over our neighborhoods. This particularly impacts neighborhoods like Roxbury that are in close proximity to colleges and universities. The Jim Brooks Stabilization Act would have provided important data about no-fault evictions. But it has failed to pass at the State House. I am fortunate to have organizations like City Life/Vida Urbana, Right to the City, and others fighting against no-fault evictions and advocating alongside me. Short-term rental companies are buying up buildings, evicting long-term tenants, and turning these buildings into de facto hotels. I have fought, along with several colleagues, to prohibit these investor units, while allowing those of us trying to stay in our homes to offer a spare room or owner-adjacent apartment for short-term rental. These are complex and difficult challenges, but we must remain unified in our fight to stay in our community. We need housing for all of us, from low income, to moderate income, and some market rate options. We need to hold developers accountable for creating the right housing mix. As your City Councilor, I look forward to your continued engagement and advocacy as we continue the fight to remain in our community. Kim Janey is the Boston city councilor for District 7 These are complex and difficult challenges, but we must remain unified in our fight to stay in our community.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT In her recent \"Re-Pop\" show at Gallery 263 in Cambridge, Marquez used sample materials from construction projects to create textural wall pieces. These are items like paint color cards or samples of tiles and linoleum. Often after colors and patterns are considered, the samples are disposed of. Marquez finds a new purpose for them. \"When you come to my studio you don't see paint, because I use everything around me,\" says Marquez. \"When you go to Home Depot and pick up colors, don't trash that.\" Marquez's style intentionally mimics the pop art boom of the 1950s. In utilizing this aesthetic with leftover commercial materials, Marquez identifies that era as the beginning of a toxic culture of mass production and consumerism. What was new, exciting, and not yet identified as bad for the environment in the '50s, now is inexcusable. \"Mass pollution is a big problem, but you can go against it,\" says Marquez. \"It's not garbage - it's materials.\" Even in her non-artistic life, Marquez is focused on preventing waste. At her dayjob at a paper product company, there often are misprints or incorrect orders. Instead of allowing the company to trash these products, Marquez donates them to local schools and libraries. Not only is this a productive use of resources, it educates children about reusing and recycling. In addition to promoting the conscious use of materials, Marquez's work critiques our culture ofexcessive consumerism. In Venezuela, she saw the wealthy waste while the lower classes suffered, and here, the same patterns exist. Construction crews work day and night to build high-rise luxury housing while the homeless population grows. The artist recounts her amusement when she moved into a new condo and found that the key fob was made of the same material as her artwork. Marquez encourages viewers to touch and engage with her work, recognizing the materials from their original purpose and thinking about them in a new way. She hopes to exhibit \"Re-Pop\" around the city, but in the meantime she accepts visitors at her Brockton studio.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT All these musical resources were evident during a rare local appearance by the musician, usually referred to simply by his first name, Vinicius, who delivered a superb 90-minute set Friday night at the Regattabar in Cambridge. After a rich career in Rio, Vinicius moved to New York in the mid-1990s, where he forged a new set of pioneering collaborations with downtown music and jazz artists. The musical flow Friday night, Vinicius, 67, spoke only to introduce his ensemble - pianist Vitor Gon\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b7alves, drummer Adriano Santos and bassist Paul Socolow - and to thank the audience. Vinicius conducted his set with the ease of a master at play, drawing on Brazilian musical traditions in all their variety and freedom through his voice and guitar to carry on an intimate conversation with his audience and accompanists. As Vinicius moved through his set, he constantly varied the pace, mood and style, alternating between gentle bossa nova songs and some pieces, including his own compositions, with elements of neo-rock and extended jazz passages. He began each with an introductory passage that let the audience know what was coming, and closed the song with a similar-sounding finale. But in between, each was a musical journey, with improvisational give-and-take between Vinicius and his accompanists, particularly Gon\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b7alves. Jazz influences About half of the 13 selections were infectious samba-inflected songs from his 2015 album \"Vinicius Canta Ant\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u201d\u00a4nio Carlos Jobim,\" his tribute to Jobim, the great bossa nova and Brazilian jazz musician. Using his low, expressive voice to precisely articulate each song's Portuguese lyrics, Vinicius brought out the musicality of his language even to those who do not know it. He talked with his hands - not only as his long fingers strummed and picked the strings of his guitar but also occasionally extending one hand to point or spread open, as if to persuade or engage his listener and emphasize the story he was telling in the lyrics. Bringing decades of mastery to his amplified guitar, Vinicius intertwined his vocals with intricate, infectious rhythmic and melodic patterns, now and then sauntering into passages of free jazz or injecting a raw reverb accent or line of funk before gliding back into a samba-inflected cadence. Wherever he went, Vinicius remained in intimate dialogue with Gon\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b7alves, a marvelous pianist who answered every spare, staccato or baroque turn with improvisations of his own. As their second and final encore, Vinicius and his ensemble performed a tender rendition of the bossa nova anthem, \"Garota de Ipanema\" (\"The Girl from Ipanema\"), written in 1962 by Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes. Vinicius lingered over its closing phrase, repeating its words, \"por causa do amor\" (\"because of love\").",

      "body": "FULL TEXT remains. Exhaustion is one of the overarching themes of the exhibition. A young child sits in a dead sleep in his father's arms; women wash clothes in the river with heavy arms; crowds in the airport collapse from physical and emotional exertion. Everyone, regardless of age or condition, works together to repair the island. With limited help from the United States government, the burden falls on the residents. \"It's not hardly over. Some places still don't have water or light. If there was already a diaspora, it's gotten worse,\" says Julia Csek\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u2022\u00a2, IBA's arts program coordinator. The photographers capture two different phases of the tragedy. Rinaldi's works illustrate the extent of the tragedy. \"Her photos are darker-she goes where the stench of death is,\" says Csek\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u2022\u00a2. She depicts a young girl, alone in the blacked-out world of her home, holding a single shining light source. She shows an elderly man struggling through the physical labor of repairing his home. The images are compositionally stunning, but emotionally excruciating. Costa depicts the slow community process of rebuilding. He captures two men sweeping sand off the street in front of a mural of the Puerto Rican flag. Another image shows two men walking across an obliterated dock, assessing the damage. Many of Costa's photographs tographs also showcase Rico is known for. This work offers sunlight. Costa doesn't sugarcoat the devastation, but he offers hope. In an adjacent room, a film about the hurricane damage plays on loop. Rios' narration accompanies images and interviews of locals. In particular, the film focuses on Boston's connection to the tragedy. Many Puerto Ricans have moved up to Western Massachusetts to escape the devastation, while others in the state have not heard from family members on the island. Several Boston-based nonprofits went down to contribute what they could to the relief efforts. On Thursday, June 28, from 6:30-9:30 p.m., IBA will host a free panel discussion featuring professionals, including Rios, discussing the exhibit and the ongoing efforts to rebuild Puerto Rico. Csek\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00e2\u2022\u00a2 points out that the problem is not just with rebuilding from this hurricane, but also implementing infrastructure for future storms. In some of the images it's clear that the broken homes were already teetering on the edge of destruction. She says, \"There will be more hurricanes. It's important to keep the conversation going.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Opening to the public on July 4, the Watershed will welcome visitors from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except Tuesday, and admission is fRee. Until Columbus Day, when the Watershed closes for the season, Boston Harbor Cruises will run an eight-minute ferry ride between the two sites from a dock next to the ICA. Museum members and ticket holders ride free, and so do visitors age 17 and under. Adding to Eastie's vibrancy Medvedow was a pioneer in bringing a vibrant cultural and civic center into the Seaport District. Now, in East Boston, the ICA brings new strengths into a community that already enjoys a rich civic life. Evidence of such vitality is visible as soon as visitors exit the ferry, which docks in lovely Piers Park, a wide swath of grass and trees overlooking the harbor. Along the street that leads to the Watershed are burgeoning community gardens and above them, artfully renovated residences. East Boston is proud of its heritage as a gateway city for immigrants. It was once second only to Ellis Island in the number of people for whom it was an entry point into this country. Home to generations of Italian families, East Boston also has gained a large Spanish-speaking population, and many community services are offered in both Spanish and English. The ICA Watershed, built out of a former copper pipe and sheet metal factory, stands among the worn warehouses in the Boston Harbor Shipyard and Marina, a working shipyard with a large docking facility and stunning views of the harbor and Boston skyline. Owned since 1985 by the Massachusetts Port Authority, the waterfront land is also host to marine businesses, a cider brewery, the Aussie-style eatery KO Pies and an artist-run nonprofit, HarborArts. A place with a storied past, the shipyard was a center for shipbuilding during the Civil War and during the 19th century turned out some of the fastest clipper ships in the world. By the 1950s, most manufacturing had ceased. Among the abandoned buildings was the one that the ICA chose to renovate as its East Boston home. HarborArts has turned the shipyard's open plaza into an outdoor art gallery. Randi Hopkins, director of visual arts at Boston Center for the Arts, and at the time a curator at the ICA, lent a hand in the project's startup. Conspicuous among the works on view is a 40-foot sculpture fashioned from recycled metal entitled \"Codfish.\" Standing on a rooftop like a giant weathervane, the sculpture was made in 2009 by local artists Roger Baker, Marc Casasanta, Steve Israel (HarborArts founder) and Bill McCormick. A community endeavor The process of creating the ICA Watershed was far more than a real estate venture. As plans took shape, Medvedow and her staff conducted vigorous outreach in East Boston and began building collaborative partnerships with local schools and nonprofits of all kinds, including health clinics, social service agencies and arts organizations. First among the ICA Watershed's programs will be projects that engage East Boston teenagers in artmaking here and at the Fan Pier museum. Last Friday's ribbon-cutting ceremony at the ICA Watershed was a scene of great good will, bringing together representatives from these organizations as well as elected officials, including Mayor of Boston Martin J. Walsh, and Thomas P. Glynn, CEO of Massport, which leased the formerly condemned property to the ICA. Anmahian Winton Architects of Cambridge designed the facility, turning the dilapidated factory into a 15,000-square-foot cultural and community space. Stack + Co. of South Boston executed the design - a ground-up, gut renovation. Grand scale Stealing the scene from the ribbon-cutting was the dramatic opening of the Watershed's industrial-scale hangar door, which rises and folds in on itself like a giant clamshell. Outside, the building is coated in translucent ivory polycarbonate. Inside, the Watershed's immense, warehouse-size spaces preserve elements of the facility's industrial past, such as cinderblock walls and massive steel chains. Its new roof features a 250-foot long skylight that runs like a spine through the building. The wall-size hangar doors in the front and rear can open the facility to both the lively shipyard plaza and a back patio that overlooks the harbor. Greeting visitors as they enter is a wall display showing the five islands that in 1833 were forged together to form East Boston. On view in an education gallery is a video of local residents telling their stories, as well as images of East Boston by participants in the ICA's teen digital photography program. Signage throughout the Watershed is in both Spanish and English. Each season, the Watershed will showcase a major artist. Organized by Eva Respini, ICA's Barbara Lee chief curator, the Watershed's inaugural exhibition presents immersive, multi-projector installations by pioneering video artist Diana Thater. Capitalizing on the vast, raw space, Thater's works inventively disorient viewers and blur the conventional boundaries of a gallery. \"Delphine\" (1999) shows a pod of dolphins swimming in the Caribbean in videos that cover the walls and floors, luring visitors into imagining that they too are underwater. \"A Runaway World\" (2017), filmed in Kenya, draws viewers into empathy-inducing close-ups of bull elephants, a species on the verge of extinction, as they gather around their watering hole. These works and others create a sense of immediacy between viewers and wildlife threatened by human excesses. Both inside the Watershed and in its setting, visitors will find abundant delights - and all this comes with a ride across the Boston Harbor.

      "body": "FULL TEXT This vision includes his latest project, an installation called \"Three Deliberate Grays for Freddie (A Memorial for Freddie Gray),\" to be placed on the Anne H. Fitzpatrick Fa\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b7ade of the Gardner Museum on Evans Way on Tuesday, June 26. The installation is an abstract portrait of Freddie Gray, the young African American man whose brutal treatment while in Baltimore Police custody led to his death in 2015 at the age of 25. The exhibit came about in part, Locke explained, because he had been \"thinking about this sort of unmonitored open assault on people of color ... and particularly the way people use policing.\" He added, \"With Freddie Gray it followed a typical scenario where someone was targeted because of their skin color. And there was a narrative: 'Oh, he had a knife,' 'Oh, he was dangerous,' 'Oh, he was wanted for something else,' where it turned out none of those things were true. And then this man lost his life and no one was held accountable for it. That sort of narrative has happened way too many times in American life.\" After repeatedly seeing the videos of Gray being arrested and images of Gray in the hospital, as well as what Locke describes as \"the sun-drenched photo of him on the street corner wearing that red shirt,\" the images were seared into his brain. \"I kept thinking about that loss, and how I wanted to mourn that loss,\" he said. For the fa\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b7ade installation, Locke generated three distinct monochromes by averaging the pixels of three individual photos of Gray that were frequently in the media. One is a family photo; one is from his arrest; and one is an image of Gray in the hospital on life support. The resulting colors form a time line of the life, suffering and death of Freddie Gray. The Gardner residency An artist-in-residence at the Gardner Museum in 2016, Locke is the 12th artist to create a temporary, site-specific work for the Museum's fa\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b7ade since it first began commissioning billboard- sized art works. Pieranna Cavalchini, the Tom and Lisa Blumenthal Curator of Contemporary Art who directs the Artist-In-Residence Program, had followed Locke's work for a number of years. She invited him as a resident \"because of his work, which is really strong and getting stronger constantly,\" she said. \"And then there was an added bonus of just who Steve is as a person. He reaches out to people in the most amazing and generous way.\" There's no curriculum or schedule created for Gardner artists-in-residence. They live in an apartment on the premises of the Gardner for a month and are given incredible access to the Museum and its collections. \"The idea is to give the artist what I call the 'giftof time,' without asking for anything,\" said Cavalchini. \"It's really allowing them to immerse themselves in the collection, which is an incredibly powerful resource. It's a living place. The artists go where they want to go.\" Cavalchini added, \"Most people end up doing work in some way that's responsive to the collection. It's always great because it's new work in the voice of the present. ... It's a great alchemy. Some really great things have come out of it including this amazing fa\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b7ade that will be going up shortly.\" Neighborhood-facing art About his collaboration with the Gardner, Locke couldn't be more thrilled. \"I wanted to make a work that faced Mission Hill thatspoke to the people who live there. The educational staffand the curatorial staffdo wonderful work in outreach to bring people into this museum, the teens behind the scenes - all these kids have this relationship with this place which is fantastic to see.\" With nothing but praise for the Museum, Locke concluded by saying, \"I come in here and I feel welcome here. I feel like this is my place and I want other people, especially people who live in this neighborhood, to feel like this is their museum. That's what the Freddie Gray piece means to me. Probably more than anything as a projection of the museum's affection for its community, and my own public act of mourning for Mr. Gray.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Extending about half the length of a city block-400 feet-along a hyperactive stretch of Main Street, with the MBTA station at its midpoint, the mural offers a whimsical, exuberant backdrop to the stream of fast-walking, texting pedestrians as well as skateboarders, bicyclists, bus passengers. Framed overhead by construction scaffolding, the mural has two tiers-a row of black and white drawings that express their makers' dreams and hopes; and below them, at eye level with passersby, a series of images painted in a bold earthen palette that evoke journeys, myths and memories. The entire mural is visible from across the street. Entitled \"Walls of Unity,\" the mural is a project of Creative Current, a multi-year initiative sponsored by MIT to build artistic and professional skills in local youth and to create connections between residents and the MIT community. Cambridge Mayor Marc McGovern took part in the unveiling of the mural on June 19th, a celebration co-hosted by MIT and open to all. Civic art The creation of the mural was planned and led as a civic art-making project by the Community Art Center (www.communityartcenter. org), located a half mile away, across from Washington Elms, a public housing complex. Founded eight decades ago, the Center provides neighborhood youth with year-round creative programming. Artist-in-Residence Salvador Jim\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9nez-Flores mentored the Center's team of six youth apprentices, each an artist, as together they envisioned, designed and executed the community art project. Over nine months, the apprentices engaged hundreds of residents and corporate employees as well MIT students and staffin creating images for the mural. \"Walls of Unity\" is the second mural created by the Center, which conducts the project as an annual program of Creative Current. \"Young people in the community gain experience and develop artistic and professional skills that can help them pursue creative careers,\" says Sarah Eusden Gallop, co-director of MIT's Office of Government and Community Relations and chair of the Kendall Square Association, a business group advancing the area as a global innovation hub. Creative Current activities also include sessions that bring local youth together with professionals from area companies to discuss their career paths and the creative skills that count in the innovation economy. Although many families in Kendall Square's adjoining neighborhoods have far lower income and education levels than the technology workers and students, a good portion of this diverse community shares the experience of being from another country. According to the 2010 U.S. Decennial Census, 38 percent of the households in these neighborhoods speak a language other than English at home. So do many of the people working in Kendall Square's research and commercial ventures and studying and teaching at MIT. As the apprentices led printmaking workshops with people from these varied constituencies, they found that the theme they chose for the mural-creating unity among people-inspired enthusiastic participation. Apprentice Sasha Williams, 19, a North Cambridge native who is starting at McGill University in September, said, \"People from different communities and walks of life pulled together. All were equally invested in creating this mural.\" An apprentice this year, William Gallop, 20, of Roxbury, looks forward to taking on the role of assistant teacher for the 2019 mural project. \"As a visual artist, I usually work by myself. During this project, I learned how to better articulate ideas as a member of a team. We set up workshops with MIT students, elementary schools, and after school programs and explored what it means to be part of a family and community. Together, we created a work of art that is on display in a place visited by people from all over the world.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Pathways provides early childhood education, serving families in 14 communities including Gloucester, Salem, Danvers, Beverly and Peabody. It serves more than 500 students and families annually with various programs, including Head Start, that reach children from birth to age 12. Mitchell joins Pathways from Boston's Action for Boston Community Development where he most recently served as deputy director of field operations providing operational leadership for 14 centers throughout Boston. He previously was director of ABCD neighborhood service centers in the South End and Dorchester and was outreach and policy director for Head Start and Children's Services. Among his board memberships have been United Way of Massachusetts Bay, Dorchester Board of Trade and Roxbury Youthworks Initiative. He holds a bachelor's degree in political science from Tufts University and master's degrees in public administration and in political science, as well as a graduate certificate in human services management, from Suffolk University. Mitchell is a Danvers resident. \"I love the work that Pathways has been doing on the North Shore for the past 50 years,\" said Mitchell in a statement. \"My interest in serving children and families as well as wanting to have a significant impact in a community led me to Pathways. The opportunity to expand the reach of its programs to a broader audience, to be innovative and to develop partnership with other organizations is exciting. Extending the reach of quality early education means that more children and more families will be served by this outstanding organization.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Ammy tells the Banner that although the couple lives in Westwood, they are familiar with the neighborhood since Michael, a licensed osteopath, owned his own medical practice in Jamaica Plain until he relocated his business, Lowney Medical, to Hyde Park. Michael learned how to lead a healthier life with a natural-based diet through his own study on medicine and disease prevention and Ammy, a former teacher at Boston Public Schools, has witnessed the effects of what unhealthy food can do. \"I saw firsthand the lack of energy kids have when they don't eat well,\" she says. \"But we can choose food that nourishes us.\" Juicygreens' menu includes cold and warm bowls of fruit with superfoods like acai, goji berries, spirulina, chia seeds and matcha. Customers can also choose more filling bowls with quinoa, mushrooms or kale and savory or sweet toasts with various spreads. Ammy says they work with farmers throughout New England and New York to source vegetables and fruits for their juices, smoothies and salads. \"Everything is plant-based, vegan and gluten- free,\" she says. Starting up Juicygreens sources its coffee from Counter Culture Coffee, a specialty coffee roaster with a local distribution office in Somerville. According to Ammy, they chose Counter Culture because they help train Juicygreens staffand they source their single-origin coffee responsibly. \"I always wanted to open a coffee shop,\" says Ammy who is originally from Colombia and grew up in Rhode Island. She pursued the idea by participating in a business startup program at the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation. She was able to pitch her business idea to other entrepreneurs. \"Based on the feedback I received in the program, we were supposed to just do a juice bar but then the community gave me the idea that we should also do a cafe,\" says Ammy. With a sharper business plan in place, the couple began scouting out potential locations all over Boston and came upon 61 South Street, a space formerly occupied by a Harvest Co-op grocery store. Situated right at the corner of South and Custer streets with outdoor seating, it's a prime location for a juice bar in an area with other independent local businesses such as Ferris Wheels Bike Shop and 40 South Street vintage shop. \"We like that we bring something a little different to this corner,\" says Ammy. \"We knew people were missing something here.\" They signed the lease last June and started the year-long process of rezoning and renovating, including painting the outdoor facade a bright lime green. Ammy says the zoning took about six months because the location changed from a supermarket zone to a restaurant zone. The cafe is outfitted with hanging and potted plants and an ample stream of natural light shines throughout the heavily- windowed interior. Then there is what Ammy calls \"the community room,\" a part of the cafe that resembles a living room with an array of straw chairs, cushy lounge chairs, a coffee table with books on nutrition and a separate corner for children to play with toys or read books. \"We're a family-oriented place,\" says Ammy while also mentioning that the bathroom has a diaper-changing table. Customers can slowly sip on beverages while conversing with friends or quietly work on their computers in the community room. Or they can attend wellness events hosted by Juicygreens on specific calendar days. \"We want to provide nutritional information to the community,\" says Ammy. For example, she says that one of her 10 staffmembers is also an ayurvedic coach and plans to host a workshop at the cafe. As owner of a new business in Jamaica Plain, Ammy says her and husband Michael's favorite part about running their own juice bar and cafe is being able to provide people with jobs. Ammy adds, \"And the smiles that people get after leaving our place.\" I saw firsthand the lack of energy kids have when they don't eat well. But we can choose food that nourishes us. ... We like that we bring something a little different to this corner. We knew people were missing something here.\" - Ammy Lowney",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"I was there,\" Randolph says. \"I had my photo taken with him.\" Randolph doesn't remember what film he saw, but he remembers the impact of seeing a black man invest in a neglected corner of the city. More than 20 years later, after Randolph obtained an MBA from the Wharton School of Business, worked in finance and launched a nonprofit anti-poverty agency, he is trying his hand at an entrepreneurial venture aimed at helping formerly incarcerated people obtain jobs that pay well. In 2016, Randolph, now living in Framingham, founded the 1854 Cycling Company as a way to provide manufacturing jobs to formerly incarcerated men and women who ordinarily face challenges finding the well-paying jobs they need to get their lives back on track. \"My goal in life is to help alleviate poverty,\" says Randolph, who spent his early years in Delhi, Louisiana with his low-income family before they moved to South Central Los Angeles at age 13. \"The bike thing is something I came across accidentally. I found out bike mechanics earn above minimum wage.\" Randolph took the name for his business from the year in which abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison, Sojourner Truth and Henry David Thoreau burned a copy of the U.S. Constitution in protest during a Fourth of July meeting of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in Framingham. Turning his back on the business school playbook he learned at Wharton, Randolph adhered to a bootstrap model of business development, seeking no outside funds for growth. He simply used his savings to purchase bike frames and components and began custom-building bikes. \"A lot of schools want you to put together a 98-page business plan, then go to a venture capitalist,\" he said. \"But that doesn't work for a lot of people of color. We have prove ourselves above and beyond what other people have to when we're in the ideas phase.\" Working under this slow-growth model, Randolph initially learned the bicycle business by trial-and-error. His first batch of three bikes with sleek steel frames, leather saddles and handlebar grips was beautiful to behold, but none sold. He modified the design, swapping out the leather for synthetic materials and began selling bikes. That experience, he says, underscores the efficacy of the bootstraps approach. \"There's no market research that can accurately predict how your product will sell,\" he says. \"The good thing about bootstrapping is that I didn't build 1,000 models. I was able to survive because I only made three of those bikes.\" Sans leather, the Craft Racer model Randolph produced began to sell, priced at $599 - a substantial price cut from his initial models. The stylish, steelframed single-speed has sold well not just in Boston, but around the world, Randolph says. So far, he's sold more than 200 of the bikes, building them as they're ordered over the internet. With that success under his belt, Randolph says he is now committed to raising funds from investors. He plans to expand his hiring of formerly incarcerated men and women and scale up the business to where he can sell 5,000 bicycles a year. For that, he says, he'll need an investment of $5 million. He's participating in the current cohort of MassChallenge, a Boston-based nonprofit business accelerator program. He says his firm's commitment to hiring the formerly incarcerated is an integral part of its brand. He is now selling his bikes in Boston through Spokehouse - Bowdoin Bike School, an Upham's Corner shop run by Noah and Giovanny De Amor. The duo plan to sell 1854 bikes exclusively at their new Sip and Spoke caf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9/ bike shop. To sell well in Dorchester, Randolph says, he'll have to lower the price point some. \"We have to build something at the same quality, but for less,\" he said. \"It will happen.\" Randolph is also branching out into electric bicycles, fitting electric-assisted hubs on existing models. He has added a threewheeled, electric-assisted cargo bike to his lineup. Ultimately, he says, he doesn't want to compete with major brands such as Trek or Schwinn, but rather continue to spin off specialized models that appeal to niche markets. But that doesn't mean the business will stay small. \"We're already selling bikes around the world,\" he says. \"We're becoming a worldwide global brand.\" My goal in life is to help alleviate poverty. ... The bike thing is something I came across accidentally. I found out bike mechanics earn above minimum wage.\" - Brandale Randolph ON THE WEB The 1854 Cycling Company: www.1854cycling.com Spokehouse - Bowdoin Bike School: www.bowdoinbikeschool.org Sip and Spoke: http://sipandspoke.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The community cruises offer food, music, intergenerational storytelling and an opportunity for residents to explore the aquatic side of the city. Kathy Abbott, president and CEO of Boston Harbor Now, says, \"Our hope is that everyone who comes in contact with the harbor falls in love with it. Last year on the Chinatown cruise, the little kids were just awestruck to see the planes landing at Logan. We want every child to feel that way.\" An RSVP link for the Mattapan cruise will be available one month before the cruise on the Boston Harbor Now website. Throughout the year, Boston Harbor Now organizes and hosts 450 free programs on the Boston Harbor Islands, including Saturday morning yoga, art lessons, history tours and overnight camping. To ease the cost of the ferry, Boston Harbor Now has partnered with the Boston Public Library to offer two-for-one ferry passes at every library branch. There are also special holidays, like the islands' opening day in May, when ferries are free. Not all of the activities on the harbor require a ferry out to islands. Of the 47 miles of coastline along the harbor, 40 are open to the public. The newly launched Boston Harborwalk web tool shows an easy-to-read map of which parts of the Harborwalk you can access and from where. It also identities which neighborhoods touch the harbor and what amenities are available, such as restrooms, kay<_B launches, Wi-Fi observation decks. Abbott says years of sanitation issues tainted the harbor's reputation, and Bostonians are still learning all that the area has to offer now. \"It was so dirty for so long, I think we all turned our backs on it,\" she says. \"Our topography is relatively flat, so unless you live on the water, you're not seeing the harbor.\" According to Abbott, the revitalized harbor now or serves as a public health asset, supporting emotional and mental health in its soothing beauty and physical health through the many active programs, like the annual Spectacle Island 5K run. But most of all, Abbott hopes that the community members visiting the waterfront will understand that the harbor is a part of their city. \"We think of the harbor as a resource for all of greater Boston,\" says Abbott. \"It belongs to everyone.\" ON THE WEB Boston Harbor Now: www.bostonharbornow.org Harborwalk web tool: www.bostonharborwalk.org",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Students audition for the program in one of three disciplines: acting, singing/ composing or dancing. Once accepted, the work begins. \"They pick a social justice theme at the beginning of the summer and develop a workshop, which they tour through the community,\" says Corey Evans, senior director of education at the Boch Center. \"The program culminates in a summer showcase performance.\" This year's theme is love and acceptance. Students are interpreting that in a number of ways, from romantic love to self-love and familial love. Last week, the 61 teen talents performed an original song, titled \"Love Ain't Always Easy,\" at the Massachusetts State House, wherein they advocated for arts funding. The program is as transformative for the students in the program as it is for the communities they support. Program participant Marck-Hens Jules of Everett says, \"The program has really helped me come out of my shell. There are many opportunities to try new things. This is definitely going to help me in the kind of art I want to do in the future.\" Deniece Woodard of Dorchester, also working in the program, was won over not only by the self-discovery, but by the advocacy portion of the experience. \"Heavy topics like the ones we're discussing are easier to take in through art,\" she says. \"Social justice is a hard pill to swallow.\" It certainly goes down easier through a song. Evans says many former program participants now work part time as group leaders for the project. The goal is to hire some of them full time, completing the circle of arts opportunities. \"Providing jobs for youth across the city is an important part of our mission,\" says Evans. \"Our niche is the arts.\" Though the program is only six weeks long, Evans says the teens grow tremendously in that time, and the confidence they develop in their skills is as important as the real world arts experience they add to their resumes. Evans says, \"A lot of teens walk away saying 'My mom didn't know I could do that.'\" This Thursday, July 26, the teens will launch an all-day flash mob across Boston to showcase an original dance performance. Keep an eye out; these future arts leaders will be hard to miss.

      "body": "FULL TEXT In 2003, Charles hung out his shingle, starting Mass Construction & Management with six employees. It wasn't easy getting started as an entrepreneur. \"When you don't have a project, you don't get a paycheck. It's scary,\" he said. \"It's much easier getting a paycheck from someone.\" Charles opened an office on Washington Street in Dorchester and began bidding on projects. He started with small projects, $300,000 and below. State government contracts kept the work moving, but in a system where the lowest bidder wins, the profit margins on such work aren't always conducive to business growth. \"You're competing against 20 to 30 bidders for the lowest bid,\" he said. \"You're competing against firms who bid at cost just to keep their people working.\" Bonding capacity Over the last 11 years, the company has grown steadily. Charles now employs 40 people and works out of an office in Stoughton that affords his business more storage space than his former Dorchester office. Like many construction business owners, Charles is looking to continue to grow by expanding his bonding capacity - the amount of money investors will commit to projects his firm undertakes. Construction bonding insulates clients against financial loss stemming from construction disruptions or delays. \"We have a bond capacity of $10 million,\" Charles said. \"We want to get to $25 million over the next five years. It's small and consistent growth.\" For that, Charles says, his firm will have to take on incrementally larger projects until it more than doubles its capacity. Currently, Mass Construction & Management is working on a $2.5 million project at an East Boston branch of the Boston Public Library. As construction manager, his firm supervises the project, subbing out work for plumbing, the HVAC system and electrical work. His workers will complete the finish work. University work What Charles finds even more promising however, is a $150,000 job rebuilding a computer lab at Northeastern University. While the project is relatively small for his firm, he says it will give him a foot in the door with local universities. \"The experience we'll get is worth it,\" he said. \"You're working for a prestigious university. If you perform at a high level, it really looks good in your portfolio.\" The university gig points to an avenue of growth Charles says he would like to pursue. \"We want to be a premier general contractor for small-to-medium- sized projects in local schools,\" he says. Certain demands come with university work. Because much of the work takes place between semesters, the time frame can be tough. \"The work is fast-tracked,\" Charles says. \"We're renovating a lounge. They want the work done within six to seven weeks, before school starts.\" On the positive side, area colleges and universities can provide a steady stream of jobs. \"The work is always there,\" Charles says. Although his brother was a general contractor, Charles did not work his way up in the construction trades. He started on as a general contractor fresh out of college. Part of the satisfaction he derives from the work comes from seeing a project completed. A greater part, he said, comes from seeing his workers head home with a paycheck. \"I come from a country where the level of unemployment is extremely high,\" he said. \"When you own a business, you can help people gain access to jobs with good wages.\" Charles is a vice president at the Massachusetts Minority Contractors Association, an association founded by the giants among black construction and management firms, including the late Ken Guscott and John B. Cruz III. Charles is quick to say his business stands on the shoulders of the early black contractors who opened doors for his generation in the notoriously competitive and insular world of Massachusetts contractors. Now, working with the minority contractors group, Charles is trying to do the same. \"We strive to help other minority contractors make it,\" he said. I come from a country where the level of unemployment is extremely high. When you own a business, you can help people gain access to jobs with good wages.\" - Maxime Charles ON THE WEB For more information about Mass Construction & Management, visit: www.massconstruct.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Boston native Rob Larsen leads the tours. Larsen is something of a graffiti history guru as well as an artist and photographer in his own right. Larsen's laid-back style and personal anecdotes bring an inviting atmosphere to the tour. He opens the experience saying, \"Feel free to be oblivious, stare at art, take pictures, I'll let you know when you're about to be killed by oncoming traffic.\" The street art and graffiti tour starts just past Symphony Hall on Huntington Avenue. The first half winds through Northeastern University's campus, which is chockfull of commissioned work. International artist Jef Aerosol painted mini pieces all over the campus in his minimalistic black and white style. His most common character is \"Sitting Kid,\" a boy drawn up into himself with his hands around his knees. Whether he's upset, sick, tired or merely pensive is up to the viewer. Red arrows are another signature of Aerosol's, they feature in each of his works. \"One of the things to notice is how he uses red to draw your eye through the piece,\" says Larsen. \"He'll look at the space that he's in and subtly, or not so subtly, use that environment.\" Cedric Douglass Boston native Cedric Douglass features notably on the tour, with two powerful pieces on Northeastern's campus. His 2016 mural, \"A World of Innocent Wonder,\" features a silhouetted child pressing the tab of a spray paint can. From the can emits a fantastical landscape with a dinosaur, Jackson Pollack-style paint splatters and Picasso-inspired morphed fish. The mural speaks to Douglass's interest in educating young people about art and showcases the incredible breadth of his talent. The first half of the tour focuses more on street art and murals while the second half hones in on the graffiti. Winding past Ruggles, through Roxbury and Mission Hill and ending in Jamaica Plain, Larsen illustrates how the big names in Boston graffiti, like Kem5, ProBlak and Zone, have evolved stylistically and moved from writing to creating depictive images. The Art Walks tour is a wonderful way to learn about local and international street artists, and to see firsthand how the scene has progressed in Boston. That said, it's not for the faint of heart, the three-hour walking tour covers three miles. Tours run through November.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"We received small donations from a lot of people who cared,\" says Noah De Amour, whose team raised almost $15,000 in the last week. In total 186 donations were made to Sip & Spoke, some from large corporations, including Eastern Bank, while others were small amounts from individuals, ranging from $25 to $500. Funding efforts were largely organized by The American City Coalition and the non-profit preservation group, Historic Boston Inc. Christine Araujo, executive director of The American City Coalition says they are \"heartened to see the community support for this revitalization project, one which brings a long dormant building into active use to meet the needs of the Upham's Corner community.\" Aside from significant donations from The 1772 Foundation of Newport, Rhode Island and Eastern Bank, Noah De Amour says their success belongs largely to the community, the hard work of his husband and business partner, Jovanny De Amour, their employees and the volunteers who have supported their endeavor since they started the Bowdoin Bike School in 2013. \"Every day I wake up feeling so lucky and fortunate to be in this position, but it's not luck,\" says De Amour, \"it's the hard work and dedication of a lot of different people.\" Having city councilor Michelle Wu champion your cause and tweet about Sip & Spoke to more than 21,000 followers also helped raise donations. The building in which Sip n Spoke will be sited is a one-story 1912 structure originally built as a comfort station - a public bathroom that supported the expansion of streetcar service into Dorchester. In 2015, the city's Department of Neighborhood Development issued a request for proposals for the redevelopment of the building. De Amor and Historic Boston Incorporated teamed up for the successful bid. Dorchester roots A lifelong resident of Dorchester and Roxbury, tired of passing by the dilapidated building on Columbia Road, Noah De Amour says he is \"excited to be a part of a team helping to re-energize the neighborhood.\" Currently located in a pop-up store on the corner of Columbia Road and Dudley Street, Noah De Amour (n\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9e Hicks) hopes to make the bike kitchen the business's \"forever home.\" The couple will consolidate the bike school and repair shop and run them both from the new location across the street. The abandoned comfort station will be reimagined by Boston-based design firm, Utile, with room for community functions, open mic nights and music performances. While HBI say that total development costs will reach over $1.4 million, MassDevelopment believe their investment will have an outsize impact on the community in Upham's Corner. Kelsey Abbruzzese, director of communications for MassDevelopment, says \"it is great news that Sip & Spoke have met their target and [MassDevelopment] are happy to provide them with the funding.\" The Commonwealth Places program that MassDevelopment offer has helped launch 51 local businesses since they started in the initiative in 2016, including a community ice rink in Leominster nd the \"Beyond Walls Mural Festival\" in Lynn. A common factor among these successful projects, says Abbruzzese, is their \"defined and vibrant community element.\" She says they are proof that \"a small investment can have a big impact, one which multiplies many times over when you have community buy-in.\" Community-focused And the community is where the team is focusing their longterm efforts. While Sip & Spoke will help save a historic building and hopefully get more locals riding bikes, they want to create a space where not just cycling enthusiasts can hang out. Noah De Amour envisions a hub where people of all backgrounds and interests can connect, without having to pay for a full meal, something, he says, is not currently available in Upham's Corner. He hopes the bike kitchen, scheduled to open at 611 Columbia Road next spring, can bring the community together over the relatively low cost of a cup of coffee. \"[Cycling] has no income, age or racial prerequisites,\" says De Amour, \"we live in such an insular, segregated society and anything we can participate in that helps fix this is beneficial.\" [Cycling] has no income, age or racial prerequisites. We live in such an insular, segregated society and anything we can participate in that helps fix this is beneficial.\" - Jovanny De Amour ON THE WEB For more information about Sip & Spoke Bike Kitchen and to donate to the campaign, visit: http://sipandspoke.com",

IBA recruits three acts and Berklee recruits the other three. Musicians are only given the stipulation that the music should be something people can dance to, and that usually means salsa. Zayra Pola Last Thursday 3nity, an all-female Boston area band led by Zayra Pola, headlined. 3nity celebrates both female musicians and international talent. \"We have three big influences,\" says Pola. \"American music, Latin music and African music.\" Though the band now has nine performers, it originated as a trio. The three founding members, including Pola immigrated to the U.S. from different countries and met while studying at Berklee. Pola says 3nity works hard to bring their own cultural experience to the audience. \"As a Puerto Rican, I have African roots and I have Spanish roots,\" she says. \"When we are on stage we send our crowd on a trip with rhythms from different places.\" Many performers are Berklee alums or educators. Eguie Castrillo, an associate professor of percussion at the school will perform with his salsa orchestra Mar del Norte on Thursday, July 19 at O'Day Park in the South End. The Tito Puente series, now 11 years old, is one of the most popular series' of Berklee's Summer in the City programming. And like most Latin American gatherings, there is a lot of dancing. MetaMovements Latin Dance Company attends the concerts to teach basic salsa steps to new dancers. But for every duo learning new steps, there are two more swishing hips and clapping hands on the dance floor like they never leftthe barrio square. The series isn't only a chance to highlight Latin American musical talent; it's an opportunity for Boston's Latinx community to come together in a celebration of their culture. And what better way to revel in your roots than to the strums of the cuatro and the bass of the bongos?",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Many other Porchfests around the country aim just to celebrate local music, but JP's festival hinges on a social justice operation. \"Unlike most Porchfests we have the mission to pull people together across class, income and racial divides,\" says co-founder Mindy Fried. \"JP has a reputation as a place that's very diverse, but in reality it's often segregated.\" Fried says making the festival truly equitable has been a process. Initially they focused on bringing in a range of performers, but as the years went on they brought affordable housing porches on board to host music and began to attract a more diverse audience. Musician J. Cottle began collaborating with Porchfest as a volunteer, but this year he contributed as a performer. Cottle's organization, Dunamis, works to educate artists in business to supplement their musical skills. \"We always say there are people to teach them to sing and dance, but who teaches them to negotiate contracts?\" says Cottle. Dunamis's set at Porchfest served the dual purpose of entertainment and education. Cottle gave his performers a contract in advance of the performance that contained a clause stating that any problems with the show would leave them completely liable for all expenses. Finding the clause was a lesson in reading contracts thoroughly and requesting fair terms. The performance also allowed Cottle's musicians to get feedback from viewers and other artists in a more casual setting. Now that Porchfest is an annual event, it's become a community effort. Fried says she and her co-founder, Marie Ghitman, have been able to delegate a lot of work to neighbors eager to participate. JP Centre and South Main Streets took over the responsibility of organizing and running a free trolley that circled Jamaica Plain, along Centre Street and South Main up to Egleston Square and back. Spoken word poets performed for all six hours on the trolley. In a neighborhood where diversity can be more of a marketing tool than a reality, JP Porchfest brings a uniquely equitable art experience to the scene. And that equity isn't just in giving artists a platform to perform, it's in giving artists and viewers of color a space to breathe and be. \"I feel good that my band, which happens to be mostly people of color, can perform freely in a way that feels natural to us,\" says Cottle. \"Being a part of that inclusion is really empowering.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Blaize points to a pen-and-ink drawing of a butterfly-like winged creature. Asked whether it's indeed a butterfly, Blaize gives an answer that gets at the heart of the Carnival aesthetic. \"The thing is about it, it's in your mind,\" Blaize says. \"It's a subliminal message. It creates interest. When you see a costume, it relates to so many things.\" Finished in gold, white and copper tones and replete with metallic foil scales, feathers and sequins, the costume will be worn by the band's queen with a harness that fits over her shoulders, and the bulk of its heft being borne by a set of wheels behind. The mass of colors, shapes and textures should function as a three-dimensional Carnival-themed Rorschach test for spectators, and more importantly, for the panel ofjudges who Blaize hopes will give the band a first-place finish in the King and Queen competition, usually held in the week before Carnival. \"It's bold, it's unique,\" Blaize says. \"In the sun it will shine.\" Carnival costume designers often rely on familiar themes - Greco-Roman designs, Indigenous American themes, Egyptian and African-inspired costumes and themes from the insect and animal kingdoms. For this year's design, Soca & Associates band leader Margaret Black started with a more abstract theme: \"Cravings.\" Asked how she comes up with the ideas for the costumes, all of which she herself designs, Black is blunt. \"To be honest with you, I don't even know,\" she says. \"Basically, it's whatever we come up with.\" Sitting in a folding chair in the middle of the mas' camp, Black cradles a rum-and-coke in a plastic cup, occasionally giving directives to one of the two dozen or so volunteers assembling costumes. Most of the work happens under an 18-foot high enclosure in the back yard, its wood and steel frame covered with plastic sheeting to keep the rain off the costumes. This year, the band's seven sections of \"Cravings\" include the themes \"Hidden Lust,\" \"Bitter Rebel,\" \"Burning Desire,\" \"Chocolate Beauty\" and \"Glitter Envy.\" Each section has its own color palate: Fuschia, purple and plum for \"Luxurious Whine,\" green for \"Glitter Envy\" and browns and reds for \"Chocolate Beauty.\" For Ashlee Perry, a Boston-born leasing agent who lives and works in Southborough and drives an hour every evening to work on the costumes, the band's theme \"Craving\" is about Carnival itself. \"It's about the excitement, the glitz and the glamour,\" she says. \"We crave to get on the road and whine. We're craving for more soca, more mas', more carnival. It's whatever you make of it.\" Blaize adds, \"It's whatever makes you say \"Wow.'\" Perry, who is of Cape Verdean ancestry, grew up watching mas' players in the Boston Caribbean Carnival and began playing mas' herself as a teenager. She, like many other mas' players, says she pines for Carnival season. Besides Boston, Soca & Associates will play mas' this year in carnivals in Worcester, Cambridge, New York and, for the first time, Miami. For each location, the band will truck the large costumes to the staging area, get assembled and compete with other bands, many of which are affiliates of larger bands in Trinidad and Tobago. Soca & Associates is Boston-based, operating solely out of the yard around Black's triple-decker and her basement, which has been transformed into an indoor mas' camp with the concrete floor painted in the bright red of the Trinidadian flag and mannequins modeling the outfits for each section. Sitting at a table in the back of the basement, Kwesi Matthew is carefully gluing rows of feathers to a head piece. On his cellphone, he plays a recording of the band's theme song, \"Craving,\" which he wrote for this year's carnival presentation. \"We waiting,\" he sings along to the soca beat. \"We cravin'\" \"For de fun,\" \"For de rum.\" That song, which Matthew plans to release to local DJs this week, will compete in Boston with \"Wine and Fling It Up,\" the soca anthem that was the official song of Trinidad's February 2018 Carnival. Black takes in the scene from her folding chair as the volunteer workforce deploys glue guns and fits costumes for a pair of women signing up to play mas' with the band. Meanwhile, she attends to the business of preparing for the estimated 400 people who will dance in costume or in band T-shirts behind the Soca & Associates sound truck - an 18-wheeler pulling a flatbed outfitted with a wall of loudspeakers and a DJ. Black, who took over the band from her mother-in-law three years after it was founded, says it's a lot of hard work keeping the band going. They held a prelaunch in November last year, displaying costumes for this year's mas. Blaize flew in from Trinidad earlier this summer to work on the larger pieces. Now there's less than a month to finish everything before Boston's Caribbean Carnival Saturday, Aug. 25. For Black, it's a labor of love. \"I just love the culture, the costumes, the people, the looks,\" she says. \"I just love everything about it.\" GLOSSARY OF TERMS Mas': Short for masquerade. Refers to those who wear costumes in Carnival. Mas' camp: A site, usually the back yard and basement of a home, used for designing and assembling costumes and as a gathering spot for mas' players. Whine (or wine): A Trinidadian version of the word wind (as in winding a clock), which describes gyrations of the waist, hips and buttocks. Soca: A music style indigenous to Trinidad and Tobago that includes elements of calypso, U.S. soul and funk and reggae.

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"We don't have enough of the small business owners coming forward and identifying themselves as small business owners,\" said Nadine Boone, lead business opportunity specialist at the Massachusetts District Office of the SBA. The increased business and jobs generated are aimed at increasing economic opportunities in the zones, according to Boone. \"That's what this is all about, it's all about economic development,\" she said. David Polatin, deputy district director of the Massachusetts District Office of the SBA, added, \"If people are living in a HUBZone and they're working in a HUBZone firm, they will pay their rent, shop at the grocery store, and it builds up the area.\" Preferences HUBZone is a preference program, so if eligible small businesses want to work with the federal government, there are setaside projects on which only HUBZone businesses can bid. \"The government has ambitious goals,\" said Polatin. \"There's a 3 percent goal for all government buying - 3 percent goes to HUBZone companies, and that's 3 percent of $500 billion. That's a lot of money, and what's happening is that the federal government isn't meeting that goal. So that's why we do events like this, to try to get people to get into the program, to take advantage of this program.\" HUBZones are largely determined by unemployment and income. If the unemployment rate in an area is 40 percent above the state rate, and the average income is 40 percent below the state average, the area is likely a HUBZone, although there are other factors that go into the formula. To be eligible for HUBZone certification, a business must have its office in a HUBZone and employ at least 35 percent of its workers from a HUBZone. In addition, it must be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by U.S. citizens, a Native American tribe, agricultural cooperative or Community Development Corporation, and be a small business according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Paul Gray, the president of a small business called Outkast Electrical Contractors in Dorchester, attended the conference. He said that business for him has been slow but progressing, and he hopes that becoming HUBZone-certified will open up opportunities to work with the federal government. Pluses and minuses While the program offers benefits for small businesses, in some cases the requirements can make applying for certification a complicated decision. Karl Coiscou owns a construction company, Quock Associates, LLC. He said he is wondering whether it makes sense to apply for HUBZone certification now, because his next big construction project is in Downtown Boston, which is not a HUBZone. However, many of his employees are HUBZone residents. He took on the downtown project because of the new push by Mayor Martin Walsh to increase the percentage of workers of color on Boston construction projects to 40 percent. He praised the HUBZone program, though, saying formerly incarcerated youth can benefit from it, especially through construction work, a field they often can work in despite having a criminal record. We don't have enough of the small business owners coming forward and identifying themselves as small business owners. ... That's what this is all about, it's all about economic development.\" - Nadine Boone \"If people are living in a HUBZone and they're working in a HUBZone firm, they will pay their rent, shop at the grocery store, and it builds up the area.\" - David Polatin ON THE WEB For more information about the SBA's HUBZone program, visit: www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/ hubzone-program",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The critical action of the show centers on a giant dandelion that sprouts on Jalil and Kwamaine's lawn and starts granting wishes. This fantastical plot functions as escapism for the two brothers and allows Wilder to tell the story of tough circumstances in a more lighthearted way. \"There's something about watching two young, black men seeing their wishes come true that brings so much hope,\" says director Summer L. Williams. \"In a world that always tells them they can't, this says they can.\" Kadahj Bennett, who plays Jalil, says the cast sat down with therapists to discuss what was going on in the boys' psyches to produce this fantasy. Though the show is comic and positive, the cast wanted to understand the serious undertones as well. Lyndsay Allyn Cox, the only woman in the show, who plays the two boys' single mother, says one of the play's strengths is its relatability. She recalls a group of school-aged kids who came to a rehearsal and said Cox sounded just like their own mothers. Both Cox and Bennett say they see quite a bit of themselves and their own experience in the show. Cox says she sees a bit of every black woman she knows in her own character. Bennett grew up with a single mother after his father passed, and their family had an important connection to black television, which plays a big role in the show. \"I love how black this production is,\" says Bennett. \"It's very black, it's very urban, but it's also about following your dreams.\" Every show is \"pay-whatyou-wish,\" with a zero-dollar minimum and a 10-dollar recommendation. Williams says, \"This is not about making an assumption about the people who would come to this theater. It's about theater being of and for the people.\" Proceeds contribute to future efforts to make theater more accessible. The Strand Theatre itself plays a role in the show, grounding the production in Dorchester, a neighborhood inhabited by people of color. Bennett says, \"I grew up here in Dorchester, I even worked at the Strand as a kid. It's awesome that people can see the stories here. Everything about it reminds me of my childhood.\" ON THE WEB To learn more about \"Leftovers\" and to purchase tickets, visit: https://companyone. org/production/leftovers/#tabs-5",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"When I was writing the proposal for this project, school shootings and bullying and immigration issues were all happening,\" says Valdez. \"I wanted to use this project to give young people a space to talk about that.\" The group of high-school-aged artists worked with Valdez over a 10week period to make the \"Still We Rise\" installation. For Valdez, the project was more about the process than the end result. She utilized the artmaking space as a healing tool, fostering conversations about current events and problems in the students' lives. One student was interested in music more than visual art. Valdez had local composer Alexander Barsov come in to work with him, and together they created background music for the exhibit. No matter the outlet, Valdez worked to make her students feel energized through whichever media spoke to them. Often Valdez would come to Urbano on days she wasn't holding class and find students there working on a mural for the show. \"I think when the students come to Urbano they feel like part of a family,\" she says. In the front gallery, \"Alone Together, Together Alone,\" showcases Valdez's own work, a dynamic mix of stone sculpture and painting. The exhibition centers on the theme of home. Valdez grew up in Argentina but has been living in different areas of the United States for many years. \"Immigrants and refugees always carry home with them,\" says Valdez. \"When I go back to Argentina I don't quite fit anymore. I always say I am from here, there and nowhere.\" One piece depicts thin white figures carved in stone and placed against a wall of the gallery. The figures have no faces, but huddle together. These unknown figures represent immigrants and refugees who come the United States with no home but each other. As immigration laws become stricter, it becomes even harder for newcomers to America to land in one stable place. Valdez depicts that uncertainty in just a few expert cuts of stone. Since its inception, Urbano Project has been a safe space for young people and art making. Urbano may be just the home Valdez was looking for.

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"We're teaching them through design challenges to get them thinking about how to design products,\" says Herb Lozano, events and marketing coordinator for the Roxbury Innovation Center. \"They actually have to create products that really function.\" The middle and high school students are engaged in one of the Roxbury Innovation Center's twoweek summer program sessions, learning about computer-aided design and other aspects of product development. \"They learn about the various stages of designing and testing a product,\" Lozano says. \"Every student will leave with a portfolio that has market research, a digital design of a prototype and an actual prototype.\" During the two weeks, students have access to many of the resources available to the adult entrepreneurs who attend classes at RIC or participate in their pre-accelerator program, a threemonth crash course in business development. Business pre-accelerator The Roxbury Innovation Center was founded in 2015 as a joint venture between the City of Boston and Venture Caf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9 Foundation. The nonprofit organization has a mission to help equip local entrepreneurs to launch and grow businesses. Participants in the pre-accelerator program are assisted in creating a business model and putting together a business plan. They receive coaching on how to pitch their product to investors. At the end of their pre-accelerator training, they take part in a pitch competition. After the program, participants are encouraged to apply to accelerator programs run by RlC's partner organizations, including Epicenter Community and Smarter in the City. Entrepreneurs who have completed the pre-accelerator program include a wig-maker, food service business owners, an event planner and several app designers. Lozano says one of the graduates developed a task management application, Golden Hour, that is selling. \"I actually have it on my phone,\" Lozano says. \"I use it.\" The pitch competition for the current pre-accelerator cohort will be held August 21. Six entrepreneurs will present their ideas before a panel ofjudges, then members of the general public will be able to pitch their ideas to the panel. In addition to the two cohorts of six entrepreneurs who have come through the pre-accelerator program, RIC has helped dozens of other entrepreneurs and small business owners through workshops on business- and technology-related topics from marketing to coding. RIC also creates opportunities for local small businesses by bringing their services and products into the Bolling Building, notes RIC Director Lanita McCormick. \"We ask people who rent our space to contract with local food businesses,\" she said. Design exposure The summer program students may be years away from launching a business, but while at RIC, they have a close-up view of the process of launching a business. Last week, product developers from the New Balance athletic shoe company discussed the product development process with the students. This week, the students are scheduled to visit the New Balance manufacturing site in Lawrence. \"They've been able to see New Balance products that haven't been released yet,\" Lozano says. \"They've been able to take everything they've learned from New Balance and use it in their own product development process.\" Gia Manigat, STEM program manager for RIC, notes that the program brings more than just training. \"The biggest value is that they're exposed to things they're not exposed to in school,\" Manigat says. \"In summer camps, they're usually playing outside. Here they get to learn something they can carry back to their school year.\" For now, a Meridian Academy 7th-grader named Natalia is focused on how to survive on that Pacific island. \"We have a list of things to make, things that could help us with food or shelter,\" she says, turning her attention to the building materials on her table. The biggest value is that they're exposed to things they're not exposed to in school. In summer camps, they're usually playing outside. Here they get to learn something they can carry back to their school year.\" - Herb Lozano ON THE WEB Roxbury Innovation Center: https://roxburyinnovationcenter.org Golden Hour: www.goldenhour.co",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"One of the things I found most interesting in my study of spirituals was the duality of it,\" says Groover. \"It's not only for worshipping - slaves were sending coded messages through it.\" That messaging, ways to cope with oppression and to find freedom, remains largely the same. Groover's album mixes the traditional words and melodies of spirituals with rhythms and beats of contemporary music like gospel, jazz and hip-hop. Many of these modern styles were born from the spiritual tradition, which is often referred to as the foundation of African American music. Groover is reinterpreting the music for today's audience. Origins After Muhammad Ali died in 2016, Groover began working on a song called \"Rumble, Young Man, Rumble,\" a favorite saying of the famous boxer. He blended the song with the spiritual \"Soon I Will Be Done With the Troubles of the World\" to create a rallying cry tailored for the 21st century. \"As a young man of color, or a young woman of color, you kind of feel like you have to rumble,\" says Groover. \"You have to fight. Even with all the degrees, I still feel like I have to work twice as hard to be recognized.\" A Boston native, Groover cut his teeth performing at Wally's Jazz Club in the South End at age 16. He attended Boston Arts Academy high school, earned a full tuition scholarship to Berklee, and is now finishing a Masters of Music Performance Studies through Berklee's Global Jazz Institute. Having grown so much in the Boston scene, Groover hopes to pass some of that experience down to the next generation of musicians. He currently serves as a jazz music educator at the Boston Arts Academy. \"It's important to me that they can see someone who looks like them teaching and performing music,\" he says. His greatest piece of advice to young musicians, he says, is to \"trust that you have something valid and important to share.\" Groover has live concerts coming up August 17 and 18 at Wally's and August 28 at the Beehive with Lee Fish Group. He's working on several 2019 concerts with the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and hopes to launch a tour of churches along the East Coast next year.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Under the physical security category, Windwalker offers support, such as risk assessments, and protections, such as armed guard services. Cybersecurity services include defense of intellectual property and other infrastructures, as well as proactive management of cyber-risk. Professional services entails helping organizations figure out problems, Duverne says. New technology Windwalker is expanding its training and instructional design component by moving into virtual reality systems, which can be used to develop immersive training programs. The company has already done innovative and award-winning training work, including their work with the U.S. Army's substance abuse program, Duverne says. The training services are bolstered by the online learning component, where the company creates learning programs, such as the new virtual reality training system. Lastly, the company focuses on research and evaluation services, specifically performance measurement and evaluation and survey management and design. When asked what ties all of the aspects of his business together, the entrepreneur says, \"We're here to help our clients to get ready.\" Duverne was able to expand Windwalker into what it is today by learning what companies need to be most effective and successful, as well as watching and meeting market demands, he says. Windwalker has expanded to seven different states since its founding in 2012. But Duverne says it wasn't easy to expand the business in Massachusetts. \"I had to branch into the federal sector, and I started looking at the federal government and looking at opportunities outside [Massachusetts], so I went to D.C., other states, going around the country just to see where else I could find opportunities and deals,\" he says. \"From that point forward, we grew from a practically one-person company to 184 people right now,\" says Duverne. Windwalker's clients include the U.S. Department of Defense, specifically the U.S. Air Force, Army, and Naval Sea Systems Command, as well as the U.S. Department of Transportation, NASA, the U.S. Postal Service, Amtrak, and the Department of Homeland Security. The defense and transportation companies are Windwalker's two main client types, and the company has contracts on both the national and state levels. New location The Windwalker office was originally downtown, and moved to Roxbury a little over three years ago. When asked why he chose to relocate to Roxbury, Duverne says he had many reasons. \"It's important for me as a minority person,\" he says. \" If I don't come here I can't expect someone who's not a minority to move here, so I need to set the precedent - like, it's okay to have your business in the community.\" He also says that being in Roxbury enables him to support the local economy. Windwalker is a certified minority business in Massachusetts and other states. \"I chose to certify because I'm a minority-owned firm. Why not certify, right?\" says Duverne. \"Sometimes there are opportunities in the state and outside of the state that require some level of certification, so I like to do that.\" He adds, \"it's not a bad thing to let people know who you are. We're a minority firm, so we're very proud of being a minority firm.\" It's not a bad thing to let people know who you are. We're a minority firm, so we're very proud of being a minority firm.\" - Herby Duverne ON THE WEB For more information about the Windwalker Group, visit: www.windwalker.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Located in the Fens, Leverett Pond, Jamaica Pond, the Arnold Arboretum and in Franklin Park, the fog sculptures go off at regular interviews daily from dawn to dusk. The installation runs through October 31. In addition to the immersive art pieces, the Emerald Necklace Conservancy will host performing artists in the unique spaces throughout the show's run. On Sunday, September 16, performance artist Ofri Cnaani will host an interactive piece called \"No Data Is an Island\" at Fog x Islands installation. During the hour-long experiences visitors will be encouraged to join a group message on WhatsApp and then wander around the exhibition solo. Cnaani will text instructions to the group like \"look up,\" and everyone will separately take a photo of their experience and share it in the group. \"So much of our lives is being mediated by our devices,\" says Cnaani. \"We are sometimes traveling places and not really being there.\" Just as the fog clouds change the perspective of the landscape, the device changes the experience of a place. Cnaani hopes people will be surprised by the different images taken of the same space and will garner a greater awareness of how our electronics alter our experience of the world. September 1-3, performing artist Naomi Bennett will unveil a 3D video projection installation in the Fog x Beach exhibit. \"I'm using inspiration from the natural elements and projecting it onto the fog,\" she says. \"I'm really interested in disembodied touch.\" Bennett became fascinated with that idea while sustaining long-distance friendships. Though she could talk with and see her friends, it wasn't the same without that physical connection. In this installation viewers will be able to walk into the video and \"feel\" it, but without a firm physical sensation. Bennett has previously lived and worked in Boston and says she hopes to bring awareness of the Emerald Necklace to the urban population. The artwork should serve as a natural escape from the stresses of everyday life. Bennett says, \"I think a lot of people could use some detachment from the world right now.\" ON THE WEB Find each fog sculpture on Emerald Necklace Conservancy's map: www.emeraldneck!ace.org/2\u00e2\u201d\u00bc\u00d0\u00bbth",

      "body": "FULL TEXT While bubble tea shops abound in Boston, the fare Ly and Om now serve at Coco Leaf Dessert Caf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9, which they opened in January of 2017, includes a wide range of traditional Vietnamese desserts, including Italian custards, French-style flan, mochi doughnuts, smoothies, sweet crepes and Vietnamese coffee. That last item is slow-brewed. \"It takes longer for the coffee to brew,\" Ly says. \"The flavor is stronger, more concentrated.\" The centerpiece of Coco Leaf's menu is its assortment of Che desserts - sweet desserts made with mung beans, black-eyed peas, kidney beans, tapioca, jellies and fresh fruits. The restaurant offers a dizzying array ofthe desserts, served in clear plastic cups displaying multicolored layers of fruits and beans, often topped with shaved ice. All of the desserts, some frozen, some baked, are made on the store's premises. The Italian custards, in strawberry, coconut/passionfruit and matcha green tea flavors, are sold in glass bottles with the Coco Leaflogo printed on the side. In addition to its extensive selection of desserts, the caf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9 Serves breakfast and sandwiches. As with all new businesses, it was a gamble opening a caf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9, especially with such a niche market. But in Dorchester's Fields Corner neighborhood - the epicenter of the city's Vietnamese population and a crossroads of the city's IrishAmerican, black, Latino and Cape Verdean communities - the demand was strong. \"The first three days, we had a line all the way to the door, constantly,\" Ly says. Owning a restaurant is more in keeping with his outgoing personality, the entrepreneur says, than working in a research lab. \"I have had a chance to meet a lot of customers,\" he says. \"It's a much more public place. I remember their names and their stories. People love to come in a talk to us.\" Ly grew up in Saigon before coming here to attend UMassBoston and Boston University, where he obtained a master's degree in biochemistry. He says his experience managing a research lab helped him gain the skills he needed to manage a staff that has grown from eight when the business opened to the current 12. Om, formerly a chef at a fourstar restaurant, gained experience opening a new restaurant for a former employer. His parents owned restaurants in Lynn. \"I've known him for ten years,\" Ly says of Om. \"He has a solid background in the food industry.\" Opening the business took a year, during which Ly continued working in the research lab while overseeing permitting and construction. Ly and Om decorated the interior with weathered wood wainscoting and benches and solid pine tables. \"We love wood,\" Ly says. \"We wanted something natural. Not too modern.\" More importantly, they had to build out a kitchen, with ovens, a grill and a serving counter. Ly says two-thirds of the startup funding came from his savings. An additional third of the funds came from a Small Business Administration loan. In the early days, Ly worked seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. Having a hands-on business partner helped keep the hours more manageable. Capitalizing on the success of the shop, Ly and Om are looking to franchise their business within the next five years. Under that arrangement, the pair would license others to open caf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9s with Coco Leaf's branding and dessert menu. In the short run, they are planning to open more stores themselves, and are currently in negotiations with a landlord for a second location. Considering their first location's success, Ly is confident their expansion plans will succeed. \"This is a unique concept,\" he says. \"There is no place in Boston - no place in Massachusetts - serving this food.\" I have had a chance to meet a lot of customers. It's a much more public place. I remember their names and their stories. People love to come in a talk to us. ... This is a unique concept. There is no place in Boston - no place in Massachusetts - serving this food.\" - Eric Ly ON THE WEB For more information about Cocoa Leaf Dessert Caf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9, visit: www.cocoleafboston.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The books showcase the breadth of Holmes' talent with two radically different styles. The illustrations in \"What Do You Do With a Voice Like That?\" look more like Holmes' other work - representational collages of black history in bold colors. \"The Stuff of Stars\" required a more abstract approach, as most of the book discusses atoms and matter. \"I really struggled with it, until one day I was in my studio and I came across this little piece of marbled paper,\" says Holmes. \"And I thought, 'This looks like the universe.'\" What emerged is an abstract visual storytelling based on the marble painting technique. Traditionally in marbled painting, an artist floats paint on water, treated with a chemical to keep the two liquids from combining. Then patterns are combed into the paint. For the book project, Holmes instead used nontraditional tactics, like blowing on the paint, for an even more otherworldly feel. As the text goes on and the universe is formed, representational shapes like butterflies and horses start to appear within the abstract paintings. The book ends with two race-less marbled figured embracing. In addition to bringing science in at a young age, the story reminds children that we all come from the same place, no matter how divided the world is now. Holmes dedicated the book to her son. \"I was remembering the magic of becoming a mother, and going through pregnancy,\" she says. \"The birth of the universe is quite like the birth of a child.\" Illustration isn't the only project Holmes has been working on. For the Roxbury Sunflowers Project, Holmes has distributed more than 20,000 sunflower seeds across Roxbury in an effort to bring beauty and nature to family gardens and uncared-for lots. She chose the sunflower for its powerful color and its resiliency, just like her hometown. \"I think it's an opportunity for people to honor their Roxbury roots,\" she says. On Thursday, Aug. 30 from 4 to 7 p.m., Holmes will host an event at the Grove Hall branch of the Boston Public Library. People who have planted sunflowers will share stories, and kids can create sunflowers of their own with provided art supplies. The Roxbury Sunflowers Project will culminate in a sunflower festival in October. ON THE WEB To learn more about the artwork of Ekua Holmes, visit: www.ekuaholmes.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Traditionally, the tale of Saint George and the Dragon describes the hero slaying a dragon that demands human sacrifices and saving the princess who would have been killed next. In his artist statement, de Nieves says, \"Saint George and the Dragon is a theme upon which I have composed many paintings. Its iconography has been the source of healing, strength, and self-revelation during my personal and artistic evolution.\" In today's world, the metaphorical dragon could be any destructive force to individuals or the community around them. Because of the mural's position on the Fenway Health building, disease, or even limited access to healthcare, could be interpreted as one of those destructive forces. The fable of the hero overcoming obstacles to create a better world is meant to inspire citizens to vanquish collective challenges. The message of coming together to solve problems is more relevant than ever in a continually divided political climate. De Nieves is a Mexican-American artist living in New York. \"All Is One\" presents only a small, muted part of his repertoire. In addition to narrative visual works, he's known for elaborate multi-media performances with his rock band, Haribo. Often in public performances he wears lavish costumes reminiscent of Nick Cave's \"Soundsuits.\" His art blurs boundaries between cultures, genders and realities. De Nieves' work has been shown at MoMA PS1, the Whitney Biennial, Documenta 14, The Museum of Art and Design and many others. The mural joins a continually growing collection of public art in Fenway, including the temporary Fog x FLO sculptures by Fujiko Nakaya and the Art Resource Collaborative for Kids (ARCK) mural near Lansdowne Street. \"All Is One\" was underwritten by Skanska USA, developer of the neighboring Harlo luxury residential building. Though given approval by the city of Boston and the Fenway CDC, the piece represents a new kind of public art in which the work, however pioneering, is inextricably linked to the gentrification of a neighborhood.

      "body": "FULL TEXT While there are benefits to the city in terms of construction jobs and increased tax revenue, there are also serious negative consequences, many spelled out in a recent report that I co-authored, Towering Excess: The Perils of the Luxury Real Estate Boom for Bostonians. One serious consequence is how quickly Boston's demographics will be transformed. Boston's luxury housing boom will accelerate the city's existing economic and racial inequalities. Massachusetts is the 6 th most unequal state in the U.S., in terms of the ratio between the incomes of the top 1 percent and the bottom 99 percent. And Suffolk County, with the four cities of Boston, Chelsea, Revere and Winthrop, is the most unequal county in Massachusetts. The richest 1 percent of Suffolk County residents have an average income of $2.79 million, which is 53.6 times the $52,149 average income of the bottom 99 percent. More housing, built exclusively for people in the richest 1 percent will accelerate, not reverse these trends, including the city's persistent racial wealth divide. A 2015 study co-published with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston examined asset ownership by race in the Boston area, taking a closer look at sub-racial groups such as the experience of Boston's non-immigrant multi-generational African American residents (called \"US blacks\" in the report) and Caribbean blacks (including Haitians). Instead ofjust looking at Latinos, the study broke down differences between, for example, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. With wealth defined as assets minus debts, median household net worth for whites was $247,500. For Caribbean blacks it was $12,000 and for US blacks it was just $8. Median household net worth was $3,020 for Puerto Ricans and $0 for Dominicans. In other words, half of US blacks and Dominicans in Boston have essentially zero wealth, they owe as much as they own. In the neighborhoods with the greatest density of new luxury housing (Back Bay, Downtown, Fenway and South Boston Waterfront), there were no home mortgage loans made to black borrowers in 2015, the last year for which we have data. Similarly, no Latino buyers received loans in the Fenway and South Boston Waterfront in 2015, according to the annual \"Changing Patterns\" report prepared for the Massachusetts Community & Banking Council. In contrast, 40 percent of home loans in Mattapan went to Blacks and 21.4 percent of home loans in Hyde Park went to Latinos. But the neighborhoods with the most substantial investment in luxury housing have zero, zip, nada in the number of loans to Blacks and Latinos. If these trends continue, Boston's luxury building boom will fuel accelerated class and racial separation in settlement patterns in Boston. The City of Boston will argue that luxury housing 's \"build, build, build\" strategy is working, that the benefits of housing trickle down will benefit Bostonians. But thousand of more luxury units will not address the current levels of inequality polarization. Given the amount of land, labor, energy and material resources being devoted to Boston's luxury housing boom, the burden is now on the city to prove that more luxury housing is doing more good than harm. Chuck Collins is a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Sudies. ...the neighborhoods with the most substantial investment in luxury housing have zero, zip, nada in the number of loans to Blacks and Latinos.\"",

As the director of cultural planning, Courtney will be responsible for managing all arts and culture planning initiatives, including program design and execution of planning-specific grants. She will act as a liaison to other city departments and public agencies, including the city's cultural districts, to ensure that planning processes align with the Boston Creates cultural plan. \"We are so excited to have Courtney join the Mayor's Office of Arts and Culture,\" said Kara Elliott-Ortega, chief of arts and culture. \"We know how important the intersection of arts and planning is to the success of Boston Creates, and Courtney will be a valuable part of our team as we collaborate with other departments, support the role of art in the public realm, and work to secure affordable space for arts and culture.\" Courtney completed her bachelor's degree at Northwestern University and later received her Master in urban planning from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, where she specialized in urban governance and social justice. She co-chaired the inaugural Black in Design Conference in 2015 and has continued to serve as an advisory board member for subsequent conference planning. Prior to joining the City of Boston, she worked as both an innovation fellow and innovation field lab coordinator at the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center, assisted with immigrant rights as an AmeriCorps member in Chicago, and taught English and arts as a Peace Corps volunteer in Morocco.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Diabate says, \"What makes it different from other festivals is that it ties these different cultures and styles together and educates about the connections between them. We have more in common than we think.\" The festival will open with a performance Oct. 19 on the Roxbury Community College mainstage. Previlus says the performance comes first this year so that audience members can identify which areas of dance interest them and then take the appropriate workshops over the rest of the weekend. Workshops are held October 20-21 at the Boston Conservatory at Berklee. Classes require no experience, and focus on fun and community-building as much as dance. \"Anyone can come to these classes and start dancing right away,\" says Diabate. This year, several new local and national dance specialists will join the festival. Junious \"House\" Brickhouse, a dedicated scholar of the Piedmont Blues music and dance style, will teach a workshop on the history and culture of the dance genre. Yesenia Fernandez-Selier will teach a high-energy Cuban rumba class, exploring how movements from rumba also appear in salsa, mambo, timba, reggaeton, hip-hop and other styles. Akili Jamal Haynes, who will be performing in an Afro-Brazilian workshop based in Orisha dance, says, \"In terms of empowering the community, coming together and sharing ideas is important, especially with all the negative images of black life going around right now.\" Ticket options include the Friday night performance only at $25 ($10 for children, $20 for seniors). Workshop tickets are sold per number of workshops, ranging from one workshop at $18 to all-inclusive workshops plus performance tickets for $160. There are also options for five workshops and 10 workshops. Diabate says they are also working on scholarship tickets for attendees with special circumstances. As the festival continues to grow, with the help of volunteers and community donations, Diabate and Previlus hope it can become a full week for maximum dance education. Though this is only the second year of the festival, clearly it fills a void in Boston's art scene. \"Calling it 'Black Dance Festival' in Boston was a bold move,\" says Previlus. \"Seeing all the different people come through the door was amazing.\" ON THE WEB For more information about tickets and the workshops schedule, visit: www.racinesfestival.org",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Reason credits her start in the cleaning business to the owner of Allen Construction & Remodeling, a local construction contractor who asked her to perform a final clean for one of his projects. \"I did the work with help from a neighbor - and the rest was history,\" Reason says. \"I started receiving work through word-of-mouth referrals and the work never stopped; it's been a continued blessing.\" \"I like seeing the finished product and providing customer service,\" Reason says about her decision to start a cleaning company. According to the entrepreneur, who grew up in Roxbury, the startup costs for Rise & Shine were minimal. For the first 10 years, Reason operated the company from her home, and only invested in a few pieces of equipment, such as floor-cleaning machines and vacuums. \"It's really not a lot, unless you're doing things at a larger level. But our contracts usually don't exceed $100,000,\" says Reason. She continues, \"You have to know what you can handle. Some companies grow too quickly and too big and they're not ready for the growth.\" Rise & Shine does not have residential customers, only commercial clients such as newly constructed buildings, office buildings and gyms. Reason employs 20 workers, including contract cleaners and administrative staff. She says they're all from Boston. \"I like hiring people locally,\" she says. \"I love and respect my community.\" She adds, \"I have an incredible team of individuals. It's a collaborative effort that makes Rise & Shine work.\" At the time of this interview, Rise & Shine had seven cleaning jobs going on, which is considered busy for the industry. The company has 10 customers for whom it regularly provides cleaning services, including some who have been with Rise & Shine since 2000. Reason says firms such as the John B. Cruz Construction Company and Crosswinds Enterprises Inc., both based in Boston, have been Rise & Shine loyal customers since the beginning. Although there is no shortage of work, some challenges come with a clientele that is mostly construction companies. \"In construction, you're waiting up to 60 days for that first check. So, if you've got four construction jobs going on and they're all telling you 60 days, but you're paying people weekly-that's a challenge,\" says Reason. Reason relies on her past experience as a project manager for Putnam Investments and as a trust administrator at Bank of America to keep her company financially strong and in the black. She recently reflected on her career and business journey while preparing to speak at a Madison Park Technical Vocational High School career day event. \"What I wanted to let the students know is that you don't have to choose one career,\" she says. \"It's okay to change. Change can be positive and healthy\" From military service, music production and corporate finance to commercial cleaning, Reason says she is satisfied with where her entrepreneurial drive has taken her. Her future plans for Rise & Shine include staying local. She says, \"I would love to acquire more work in the community. More contracts locally would allow me to continue to provide employment and professional growth opportunities for Boston residents.\" \"I like hiring people locally. I'm big into the community. I don't want to leave the community. ... I have an incredible team of individuals. It's a collaborative effort that makes it work.\" - Lois Reason",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Williams has roots in New England, having gone to prep school at Northfield Mount Hermon and then Wheaton College. After working in Wall Street for five years, he moved to Boston with his wife, solidifying his love for Boston sports teams. Williams put down an initial investment of $15,000 to produce his product and start Boston Sports Apparel Co. in 2008. But then his colleague called. \"[He] said he couldn't do it. He oversaw accounts for GE Capital and they got spun off. His job wasn't safe,\" says Williams. \"I didn't want to take the loss and went out in Fenway to sell the shirts.\" Working in the office by day and hollering out his T-shirt sales pitch by night, Williams paid attention to what sold and what didn't sell, as well as what other T-shirt sellers were doing. \"I could see further down the road than others could,\" he said. \"I saw what was beyond and what my next step would be.\" His next step would be introducing his designs to other local stores. \"I was scratching and clawing, introducing myself to owners of stores.\" The stores were receptive. Then, the company grew even more after Williams hired a sales representative \"who tripled our business overnight because he had an existing list of customers.\" Brick-and-mortar presence Today, the business has three brick-and-mortar retail stores with the name I Love Boston Sports, with 20 employees across all three stores. I Love Boston Sports stores are located at Legacy Place Mall in Dedham, South Shore Plaza in Braintree and Faneuil Hall Marketplace. The first retail location was in Dedham, when Legacy Place first opened 10 years ago. \"We didn't have a tremendous amount of product, only four shirts, and the economy was bad, but I wanted to jump-start our growth,\" says Williams. Although Williams only had four designs at the time, they were wildly popular ones. His shirt with \"McHale, Parish and Bird\" emblazoned on the front was a huge hit, and was even worn on an episode of \"Saturday Night Live.\" Last year, I Love Boston Sports had the opportunity to start as a pushcart retailer in Faneuil Hall, the tourist spot in Boston with the most foot traffic. \"We became the number one pushcart and they worked out a deal with us to open a store here,\" says Williams. His designs have become more elaborate and include cheeky inside jokes and references to pop culture and U.S. history. The \"Crossing the Charles\" T-shirt, a parody of the famous \"Washington Crossing the Delaware\" painting, depicts the New England Patriots team on the Charles River with quarterback Tom Brady leading the way. Although Williams comes up with the idea for each design, he hires experienced artists to make his visions come to life. \"The unique part about all of our artwork is that there's the stories inside of the art, there's hidden things,\" he says. Business challenges Not every business deal worked out for the best. \"One aspect of our business is trying to grow beyond the region. And as a hedge to what we do for the Boston teams, to be able to replicate this on a national level,\" says Williams. In 2013, Sports Authority approached Boston Sports Apparel to be a national vendor of hot market items. However, Sports Authority went bankrupt in 2016, owing Williams' company several thousand dollars. \"It was not fun, but experiences like that are good because it shows you what you're made of and what fortitude you have,\" he says. Fortunately, soon after the Sports Authority setback, Boston Sports Apparel was able to revive an earlier business relationship with Olympia Sports and sell their products through them. According to Williams, at the time Sports Authority went under, the sports apparel industry was going through abrupt change. Fanatics Inc., a large apparel company, struck a deal with the major leagues for exclusive access and license to sell professional team apparel online. \"With the Fanatics deal and websites like Amazon, small mom-and-pop stores weren't able to carry official apparel on their websites,\" says Williams. Competitive edge The Fanatics deal served to wipe out local competition for I Love Boston Sports, because Williams had never had the apparel licenses. He used only original designs. \"The fact is [Fanatics Inc.]'s product is so mundane, ours looks refreshing to fans.\" Williams says he thinks of design ideas before falling asleep every night, staring at the wall above his bed. \"I look at it as a blank canvas and come up with a framework of an idea. Usually I grab my phone and start typing it out, too, and put it into effect.\" Although I Love Boston Sports has a number of longstanding designs such as the Beatles \"Abbey Road\" album cover parody with Boston team players, Williams knows he has to think about the next thing that will capture customers' short attention spans. \"I know at some point, people might say, 'Eh, I've seen that before,' so I have to think now about what's next, to keep it moving.\" But for now, Williams isn't threatened by the big corporations. \"The beauty of what we do is we are more nimble and more connected to what fans want,\" he says. \"We're fans, just like they are.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT In the words of a senior, \"Winsor girls have a passion to create change in the world, and that's something that the world definitely needs.\" In today's world, \"we need one another now more than ever,\" reflects Head of School Sarah Pelmas. She often reminds students of the power in community: \"We thrive in helping others to thrive.\" Winsor graduates have been leading lives of purpose, generosity, and joy for more than a century. Today, the school continues to build on a tradition of providing girls with an education second to none. In preparing girls to \"contribute to the world,\" Winsor opens girls' eyes to their own extraordinary potential to \"contribute\" in countless ways, from cutting-edge Global Studies, to hands-on STEM courses, to extensive arts and athletics. Every day, their equally passionate teachers build an unparalleled academic foundation and the creativity, critical thinking, and confidence the future demands. What makes Winsor so \"magical?\" In students' own words: * \"Everyone who's here is really excited about being here.\" * \"Having such smart and strong girls around me, I feel like I'm in a community where I'm accepted and can be myself.\" * \"The teachers are all super, super supportive.\" * \"If you're a little quirky, that's totally fine.\" * \"Being in a class of 60+ girls who really care about you and want you to succeed is really special.\" Located in Boston's dynamic Longwood Medical Area, Win-sor's historic campus features extensive new arts and athletic facilities and innovative academic classrooms, inspiring girls to explore, lead, and collaborate. Its 470 students come from every corner of Boston and more than 50 surrounding communities. The school strives to be \"a place where everyone feels welcome,\" reflects Julian Braxton, director of community and multicultural affairs. Affinity groups are a powerful way in which the school lives out its ideals of welcome and support. Groups include SISTERS, short for Sharing Individual Stories Through Everyone's RootS, a support system for girls of African-American, Afro-Caribbean, Cape Verdean, and Latina descent; SOMOS, an affinity group for Latina Heritage and Hispanic Heritage students, and AsIAm, for students of Asian descent including the Indian subcontinent. \"The best part,\" explains one Winsor student, \"is knowing that everyone comes into our group with an open attitude. We bond with one another and share parts of ourselves and honestly become each other's sisters.\" From the start, \"we try to teach girls the importance of actively and positively defining yourself,\" adds Mr. Braxton. At Winsor, \"we want every girl who comes through the door to feel like this is her place,\" explains Ms. Pelmas. Each fall, the school's Parent Network for Diversity also sponsors a \"welcome\" event, helping girls and families feel at home at Winsor. Winsor's lessons - and friendships - stay with girls for their lifetimes. The college choices of Winsor graduates reflect the strength of both the school and its students. While college is in girls' immediate futures, Winsor truly prepares them for life. \"We're excited to share why Winsor is such a special place,\" says Pamela Parks McLaurin, director of admission and financial aid and a Winsor graduate herself. When she talks to girls, she weaves a simple invitation into her conversations: \"Challenge yourself. Enjoy yourself. Be yourself.\" The admission team looks carefully at every girl who applies, and seeks girls who will thrive here. Intellectual curiosity, academic ability, motivation, a generous spirit, and a respect for difference are all part of what Wnsor seeks. On Monday, Nov. 12, the school's annual Admission Open House will offer interested families a firsthand glimpse of Winsor girls and teachers in action on a typical day.

      "body": "FULL TEXT When Mayor Martin Walsh first took office, he challenged Boston city employees, including Gentle, to brainstorm ways to help Boston families improve their economic mobility. Such efforts led to the creation of the Mayor's Office of Financial Empowerment and the transformation of the Roxbury Resource Center into the Roxbury Center for Financial Empowerment, within the Office of Workforce Development, funded by the BPDA. Today, charged with the responsibility of providing economic mobility and workforce development for Boston residents, RCFE serves five to six thousand residents per year. This transformation required initiative and professionalism The number of employees at RCFE doubled Gentle and his staff underwent extensive training and certification to become financial coaches while also learning grant management tools and new software. Alan also had to create a public communication program to inform residents about these free opportunities and encourage them to participate. Additionally, Gentle had responsibility for managing the move to a new and less visible location. Despite these challenges, he and his staff have met service goals for financial coaching to several hundred residents per year (in English or Spanish), tax preparation for nearly 1,500 households each year, and free counseling for several thousand individuals who come to RCFE workshops on credit building, workforce development, or job assistance. This success has resulted in more funding for their work and helps assure the continuation of these remarkable programs.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Nate is a talented young man who has achieved success in the classroom and in athletic competition as a high school student. He is a starting lineman on Roxbury Latin's varsity football roster, captain of the varsity wrestling team, and a shotput and discus thrower for the varsity track and field team. Nate is also a stellar student, perennial leader of the school's Classics Club, a member of the debate team, sound technician for the dramatics program, steady baritone in the Glee Club, and much more. He has no shortage of abilities and inherent talent. Over time, though, Nate has learned to place far greater value on the quality of his effort and in the strength of his resolve. This allows him to savor the process, and even the struggle, of his experiences as much as the positive results that may come from them. Nate and his 52 classmates, seniors now at The Roxbury Latin School in West Roxbury, MA, have been tested physically, intellectually, and emotionally as they have grown up within the school. Taking part together in the classroom experience at Roxbury Latin, they have learned to assume responsibility for their studies. Challenging assumptions, seeking out interest, demanding urgency and relevancy from the work they embark upon, Nate and his peers have taken ownership of their academic growth and made the work matter to them. Such a transition signals the maturation of a student that Roxbury Latin considers fundamental, and that it works to foster in each and every boy of the school. Roxbury Latin expects its older boys to demonstrate to the rest of the student body what widespread involvement and scholarly investment look like. Nate and his fellow seniors understand the responsibility they share to lead the student body and to model Roxbury Latin's values: honesty, integrity, and generosity of spirit. The years these seniors have shared have granted them countless opportunities to learn from one another and to compete alongside one another. Nate and his friends have joined voices in song as members of the Glee Club. They have rehearsed for musicals, practiced for big games, and grappled together with important questions that have tested their intellect, their worldviews, and, profoundly, their souls. They have learned the value of the joint venture. As a class they recognize the strength of their whole and the power in their multitude. Together at Roxbury Latin they have put aside differences, let down defenses, and lifted one another up. Celebrating another's success and commiserating with another's loss have taught these young men empathy. They have learned to register the environments around them and to know with conviction how, and when, and why they must act upon their world. As Roxbury Latin students, they have come to know that they must be more than individuals in dogged pursuit of personal goals. They have the responsibility to act as citizens of larger communities, serving interests that extend beyond their own as they honor the school's call to lead and serve. A small school of 303 boys, Roxbury Latin is located in West Roxbury. Easily accessible from all parts of the city of Boston, the school is proud to serve the community it has been a part of since its founding in 1645. Nate Lopes, a shining example of one whose commitment is broad and whose investment is full, is one of many similarly bright and engaged students who together comprise the Roxbury Latin student body. As an independent, all-boys day school, Roxbury Latin is a distinctive community comprised of boys from various backgrounds contributing various talents. Through its need-blind admission process, the school seeks ambitious young men who endeavor to realize their potential and aspire to do something good with their lives.

      "body": "FULL TEXT The expansion on the second floor of the Dorchester Bay Economic Development Corporation office building converted the 2,000-square-foot space into a 2,900-square-foot lab, with additional facilities for a rotating art gallery, event space and co-working space for 51 creative entrepreneurs. According to Yadav, the expansion was funded with support from MassDevelopment, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' economic development and finance authority, through a Collaborative Workspace Grant. The lab opened in 2015 offering memberships for local art and social entrepreneurs that include free legal assistance, networking, business training, marketing services and co-working space. In addition, the FIL Launch-pad, a 12-week accelerator program for early stage startups, provides 25 entrepreneurs with mentorship, business education and peer-to-peer networking. Amir Dixon, founder and creative director of visual design firm Amir Now, Inc. (ANI), told the Banner at the lab's re-opening that FIL startups and co-working members all have their creative lens set to solve social and economic equity issues. \"We're a community of creators who push each other,\" he said. \"To address injustice, it requires building our businesses and providing jobs and training to our community.\" Insa Elliott, founder of Market 2Day, spoke at the grand re-opening event, recalling her experience as part of the FIL Launchpad's winter 2018 cohort. \"I got inspiration working with people who had a vision for their incredibly creative and meaningful ventures. That led me to work harder on what I was working on,\" she said. At the grand re-opening, Marea Parker, board president of Artmorpheus, announced the creation of the Liora Beer Scholarship. Artmorpheus is an artist-driven nonprofit also founded by Liora Beer. Yadav told the Banner that the scholarship, honoring the legacy of Liora Beer, will be offered to two people, an artist and a creative entrepreneur, beginning in 2019- Scholarship recipients will receive technical assistance, business support and event space for exhibitions. More details and the application process for the scholarship will be announced in the coming weeks. David Weingarten, who was Beer's husband, spoke at the event. \"If you're a recipient of a Liora Beer Scholarship for an entrepreneur in the arts, take chances, embrace risk, grow your ideas, love your community, help the people around you, fight hard and have fun,\" he said. Weingarten spoke about why Beer created the Fairmount Innovation Lab. \"Her idea was to bring resources to local people who are talented, smart, hardworking but maybe didn't have a perfectly formed idea of what they wanted to do.\" He added, \"Or maybe they had an idea of what they wanted to do but not what they could do.\" Dixon recalled the first time he met Beer, when he became a member of FIL about a year ago. \"I talked to her about my vision, and I will never ever forget it. She asked me, 'How do you aim to bring your creative skills to impact your community?' And I will always be grateful for that conversation.\" Marcelous Atmore, founder of Express Cuts 10.18, was a summer 2017 Launchpad cohort participant. His company connects local barbers with clients through a mobile application platform. He was interviewed by Beer when he applied to the Launchpad program. \"She was looking for something more artsy, but she believed in what I was doing. And then all these resources became available to me that I was [previously] finding hard to get a hold of,\" said Atmore. With future programming and bigger space, the Fairmount Innovation Lab aims to be \"a hub for the local creative economy,\" said Yadav. \"We're a community of creators who push each other. To address injustice, it requires building our businesses and providing jobs and training to our community.\" -Amir Dixon ON THE WEB The Fairmount Innovation Lab is currently accepting applications from early stage creative and social entrepreneurs for the FIF Faunchpad until Oct. 26. Applications are available at: http://fil594.org/application/ For more information about the lab, visit: http://fil594.org \"I got inspiration working with people who had a vision for their incredibly creative and meaningful ventures.\" -Insa Elliott",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The songbook referenced much of Pierce's musical trajectory through his tenure in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, as a member of the Roxbury-born Tony Williams' band and as a band leader in his own right. Undergirding Pierce's playing and musical sensibilities are the chops he formed working in the late '60s and early '70s in the house band at the legendary Boston soul club, The Sugar Shack and playing with Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye. Anchored by drummer Ron Savage, Dean of the college's Professional Performance Division, musicians in the first set included tenor saxophonists Javon Jackson, Mark Turner, Melissa Aldana and alto saxophonist Antonio Hart. David Gilmore was on guitar, Lawrence Fields on Piano and Ira Coleman on bass. The second set featured Terri Lynne Carrington and Ralph Peterson on drums, Kevin Eubanks on guitar, and Jake Sherman on Hammond organ, as well as the sax lineup from the first set. Javon Jackson, a tenor heavyweight and alumnus of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, kicked off the first set with \"My Shining Hour.\" Savage accompanied the saxes, guitars and Sherman's keys, playing off the soloist's rhythmical patterns. Turner's gentle, mellifluous tone wowed the audience and elicited gentle responses from the rhythm section. Aldana's more muscular approach wowed the crowd. On the second set, Pierce started with an uptempo Tony Williams tune, \"Warrior.\" On the drums, Carrington kicked up the intensity a notch, with rhythmic patterns that showcased Pierce's virtuosity. Carrington ended the tune with a rollicking solo, backed by Sherman on the organ. On the ballad \"My One and Only Love,\" Pierce began with an extended improvisation that led into the melody of the ballad. Playing without drums or keys, Pierce and a subdued Eubanks showed off the rapport the two have forged over years of playing together, going back to their time in Art Blakey's legendary 1980 big band. Next came the sole Pierce-authored tune of the set, \"Sudan Blue,\" a hard-driving blues number. \"Alter Ego,\" penned by the late James Williams, who intersected with Pierce at Berklee and in the Messengers, featured solos from Aldana and Turner, whose soft-touch approach temporarily quieted Carrington's intensity. On Victor Lewis' \"Hey, It's Me You're Talking To,\" Antonio Hart and Javon Jackson joined the set. Ralph Peterson took over on the drums, punctuating his playing with press rolls and bass drum hits that kept the soloists from staying too long in a groove. On the last tune, Joe Henderson's \"Finale - Homestretch,\" Peterson traded fours with the sax players, before taking his final drum solo. The audience, which included many of Pierces former students and colleagues from Berklee, as well as luminaries from the local Boston jazz scene, responded to the band's concluding number with a standing ovation. The concert marks the end of a chapter for Pierce, who has taught on-and-off at Berklee since 1976. But his departure from Berklee does not in any way signal a retirement.

      "body": "FULL TEXT One day Da Silva snuck onto the sewing machine and started making clothes. Her grandmother found out and scolded her for using her machine, but then softened when she saw what Da Silva had been working on. \"She said, 'Wait, hold up. You made that?'\" Da Silva recalls. \"She was impressed. From that day on, I was sewing every chance I got.\" The transition from artistic hobby to a full-time business venture occurred later on, while in college at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. Da Silva and her family immigrated to the U.S. in 2004 when she was 17. She was on the planning committee for the university's \"Africana Night\" event, but her team lacked the funds to hire a designer to participate in a fashion show. Much to the surprise of her peers, Da Silva volunteered to make the designs, revealing a hidden talent no one knew about. She designed 25 looks for the event. \"Everyone loved it, and I was in the school newspaper the next day and they called me a fashion designer,\" says Da Silva. \"And I was like, I'm a what?'\" She sold her first dress at the fashion show for $80. \"I knew how to make clothing and I loved it, but I didn't know I could actually become a fashion designer and get paid for it,\" says Da Silva. Soon she was selling more and more designs to her schoolmates, out of the trunk of her car, and was invited to showcase at other fashion shows at other colleges. In 2015, Da Silva was ready to take her fashion business to the next level and opened her own boutique at 1225 River Street in Hyde Park. The entrepreneur says the space happened to be available and within her budget. \"Financing the store was a little tough in the beginning,\" she says. Friends and family helped to start up the business. At the boutique and showroom, original Josefa Da Silva designs are on display with jewelry and shoes by other designers. Da Silva describes her designs as an eccentric mix of Asian and African styles in vibrant colors and avant-garde shapes. The clothes run in sizes 2 to 18 and are priced from$20to $2,000 depending on whether the piece is custom-made or not. According to Da Silva, the larger sizes tend to sell more quickly than the smaller ones. She is currently working on a plus-size collection to debut in New York in February. The designer has a core team of six people who assist with design, production, marketing and sales. The Da Silva team introduces new designs and collections every season, and mostly produces the clothes in-house. Da Silva says she experimented with mass production at one point, but \"it's a huge cost and we needed to have a much larger team to move and sell those products.\" Da Silva has embraced the global market, showcasing and selling her designs from Jamaica, Nigeria and Brazil to New York and Los Angeles. Although her business has thrived around the world, the local market was a challenge when Da Silva first opened her Hyde Park store. \"It was tough for me. To be able to design but also sell my products so I can maintain the shop,\" she says. The area in particular wasn't the exact market that her high-fashion designs are intended for, but Da Silva has adapted by making items that are less avant-garde and more affordable and digestible to sell locally. \"But in the future,\" she says, \"we will be there in places like Newbury Street and we will continue with our high-end model.\" Da Silva's fashion business began to really take off as she was finishing up school at UMassBoston, and she decided to focus on her passion full-time instead. \"Things were hard. I was trying to run a business at that time and I just never went back to it,\" she says. \"I took that leap of faith and was like, I'm just going to do this.'\" Harnessing inborn talent and entrepreneurship skills, Da Silva continues to make strides further into the world of fashion, in Boston and beyond. IF YOU GO The Josefa Da Silva boutique is at 1225 River St., Hyde Park. It is open 10 a.m.-B p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.

      "body": "FULL TEXT The idea emerged in 2014 while Coleman was working on \"Check the Technique Volume 2: More Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies,\" a book that tells the stories of hip-hop music through interviews with the artists. He ran across a few advertisements for concerts and was fascinated with the history they illustrated. For \"Buy Me Boston,\" Coleman focused on localized publications like The Bay State Banner and The Phoenix, pulling heavily on the archives of David Bieber, former creative director for the Phoenix, and Kay Bourne, former Bay State Banner arts writer. \"For me it was about local businesses, local entrepreneurs, local musicians,\" says Coleman. \"One of the things this book does is stitch back together a Boston that doesn't exist anymore.\" Bourne says, \"'Local Ads & Flyers' is the first book that has come across my desk to offer a straightforward picture of Boston as a whole and vibrant city. It puts African Americans and others on an equal footing. It's a corrective to the usual portrait of Boston where blacks are relegated to a few pages, if mentioned at all.\" The book features reproductions of the ads, all scanned from the original sources, with information about what the item is, what year it was published and its source. Coleman said he deliberately didn't add scholarly commentary to each piece, preferring to let the ads stand alone as a visual guide to the city. Coleman hopes the book will not just provide nostalgia, but also inspire new businesses to draw from Boston's history. For readers interested in finding more information or seeing the ads 'live,\" select pieces from Bieber's archive make up a regularly rotating exhibit in the lobby of the Verb Hotel in Fenway. Bourne's archives, which were donated to Emerson College, are not yet on view to the public. \"Buy Me Boston\" is available for purchase locally at Newbury Comics, Brookline Booksmith and Tres Gatos restaurant, book and music store. Signed editions are available directly from Coleman via his website. On Nov. 11 at 7 p.m. at the Brattle Theatre, Coleman will celebrate the book launch with a panel discussion, multimedia presentation and book signing.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Oompa is self-described as \"a Boston-born poet, rapper and educator, who is forever representing the queer, black, orphaned, hood kids.\" In 2017 she won the Women of the World Poetry Slam and she was a finalist in the 2016 National Poetry Slam. Words are at the core of her work, sliding rhythmically and rapid-fire in her poems and songs. In one of her 2017 slam performances her poem rang, \"Black dyke girl is an apology/for being on the wrong side of whiteness/ of bed, of the poverty line/for taking up too much space/having too much waist.\" She describes the catch-22 of representing as masculine or feminine in a black body. There are risks at both ends. Oompa currently lives in Cambridge and is working on a highly anticipated second album. Her music can be found on Spotify andYouTube. Dutch ReBelle, a Mattapan native, released her newest album \"Bang Bang\" this month, just in time for the Gardner concert. She won one of The Boston Foundation's 2018 Live Arts Boston Grants, which has facilitated the new release. \"Bang Bang\" her first full album since 2014, grapples with her identity as an artist, where she's often pigeon-holed into just the rap or hip-hop categories, and as an African-American, drawing from her Haitian heritage. The new sound in \"Bang Bang\" fuses Afrobeats and strains of rock with rap for more dynamic composition than her earlier hip-hop album \"ReBelle Diaries.\" On her website she writes that this desire to push boundaries began in her childhood. \"While most young girls were into boys and beauty, ReBelle was intrigued by the hip-hop magazines that would come for her male cousins ... ReBelle never felt she fit in to the normal standards surrounding her.\" Her music is available on Spotify, iTunes and SoundCloud. The RISE series and the Oompa and ReBelle concert is one of many ongoing efforts by the Gardner to incorporate more contemporary, multicultural voices in the museum's artistic conversation. It's also an important step in celebrating Boston's hip-hop industry, which so often faces resistance from mainstream institutions.

      "body": "FULL TEXT HAVING FAITH For Headley, who grew up in the church and \"loves gospel music and lives by gospel music,\" the path to Broadway and performing has been a miraculous one, she says, and her success and the various roles she has played astonish her to this day. The actress made her Broadway debut as Nala in the original Broad way cast of Disney's \"The Lion King in 1997. Three years later, she origi nated the title role of Aida in the Elton John and Tim Rice musical and went on to win a Tony Award for Best Ac tress in a Musical. Being on Broadway wasn't some thing that she ever dreamed of as a child. Her first introduction to the idea of being a performer was around the age of 6 or 7, she says, when a woman from her church asked her parents if she could take her to the movies to see \"The Sound of Music.\" Headley remembers putting on her favorite Sunday dress for the special occasion. It was a heady first experience for the young girl, who upon seeing the Julie Andrews-led film, \"thought all movies should have music, and you just broke out spontaneously in song.\" Her second introduction came at 15, when her teachers encouraged her to try out for musicals. The Trinidad native found that she loved the whole experience, from reading a script to being on stage. Headley reveals that the first Broadway show she ever saw was when she herself performed on Broadway. \"That's why I say my journey there is so miraculous. I'm grateful for it and I'm grateful that Broadway has opened its arms to me and I can open my arms and hug it back,\" she explains. Highlights Headley earned an Olivier Award nomination for her West End stage debut in \"The Bodyguard,\" in which she portrayed Rachel Marron, the character made famous by Whitney Houston in the film version. In 2016, she returned to Broadway as Shug Avery in the Tony-winning revival ?~`T~ Color Purple.\" In addition to her roles on Broadway, she currently stars as Gwen Garrett in the NBC medical drama \"Chicago Med,\" where her character goes toeto-toe with Sharon Goodwin, portrayed by S. Epatha Merkerson (\"Law & Order\"). The series marks Headley's second foray into television, after playing Dr. Jamison on the Netflix series \"She's Gotta Have It\" in 2017. New lessons Working in television has been a good learning experience, says the stage actress, who describes it as \"a different kind of discipline.\" She says she feels blessed to be working with the \"Chicago Med\" cast and especially with Merkerson, with whom she loves sitting down to hear stories about her work, her acting roles and her time on Broadway.

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"Whenever I get on the mat, I find my balance,\" she says. \"When I first tried Bikram yoga, I took it for seven days straight and cancelled my gym membership.\" Bikram yoga, the main experience the studio offers, is traditionally practiced in a room heated to at least 105 degrees Fahrenheit and at 40 percent humidity. Participants then stretch and sweat their way through 26 poses. \"It's good for beginners because the routine is the same no matter where you go, which allows people to go deeper into their poses through repeated practice,\" says Blackett-Dibinga. Previously a weight-training and track athlete, Blackett-Dibinga used Bikram yoga to strengthen and heal her chronic knee pain and to manage stress on a daily basis. She has been practicing yoga for 15 years and Bikram yoga for 10. The entrepreneur grew up in Dorchester and has been living in Washington, D.C. with Omekongo since 2005. Before the couple opened their own yoga studio, Blackett-Dibinga was a senior director at an international organization focused on assisting children with HIV and AIDS in East and South Africa. Her job consisted of traveling back and forth between the two continents, something that grew increasingly difficult after she had her own kids. \"I didn't want to keep traveling anymore, I wanted to stay close to my kids. Opening a yoga studio was an opportunity for me to create a lifestyle I wanted,\" says Blackett-Dibinga. The Dibingas opened their first BikramYogaWorks studio in 2014 in Riverdale Park, Maryland where Omekongo was studying for his doctoral degree in International Education Policy at the University of Maryland. \"It was difficult finding a good contractor,\" says Blackett-Dibinga, recalling her early business challenges. \"They could tell we had no idea what we were doing and so they screwed us over. I had sunk all my savings in opening the first studio.\" Thankfully, the owner of the building helped the couple complete the first studio buildout. Since then, the BikramYogaWorks network has quickly expanded. There are four other studios, in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, and a second one in Maryland. The Boston studio, located at 561 Boylston St. in Copley Square, opened Oct. 1 and the newest one, in Baltimore, opened Oct. 27. As a business strategy, the couple seeks partnerships with mixed-used developers who are open to including a yoga studio in their office, commercial or residential buildings. \"They see that we have a valuable amenity and quality service,\" says Blackett-Dibinga. Although each studio carries the BikramYogaWorks name, each location is its own independent business entity, in order to decrease liabilities for the owners. Blackett-Dibinga tells the Banner that it was her goal to open a studio here in her hometown. She visits Boston often and teaches classes at the studio with Maudi and Shaumba-Yandje Dibinga. Prior to opening a Boston location, the Dibingas would practice yoga at other studios while visiting Boston, and were often the only people of color in the room. \"It made me think, does the wellness industry target people of color enough?\" says Blackett-Dibinga. \"We want to let people know that Bikram is for everyone and can benefit anyone,\" she says. \"It's going to help you, no matter who you are and what issue you may have. It helps with range of motion, flexibility, pain and even your sense of self.\" They make their studios accessible, she says, by offering a $49 month-long trial of all their classes and services. If a client then chooses to become a member, it costs $135 a month and includes all Bikram, Pilates, and LifeStretch classes, two posture workshops a month, free mat rental and two free guest passes per month. BikramYogaWorks doesn't just offer yoga classes, it creates a sense of community and provides the tools for an enriching life. \"We want people to come here to connect and meet other like-minded individuals because they might not connect enough with others in their jobs, driving in their cars or through their phone screens,\" says Blackett-Dibinga. Along with yoga and Pilates classes, the studio also offers inhouse services such as fascial stretch therapy, cryotherapy, educational workshops, inspirational talks, often led by Omekongo, and organized wellness retreats to places like Bali. \"We want to create a total body, mind, and spirit experience,\" says Blackett-Dibinga. To further foster community, they offer a simple but nutritious treat of pineapple slices after class on weekends to give clients a chance to sit and engage with others, instead of hurrying off to the next part of their day. The Dibingas employ two core staff members and eight to 10 instructors per location. \"We look for energy and customer focus among our staff members and instructors. We care more about how you treat the client than your teaching abilities,\" says Blackett-Dibinga. They aim to host at least 20 people in each class and have 2,500 members at each studio. \"Our goal is to increase membership because the clients save money on classes and we receive a steady stream of revenue in order to stay afloat,\" says Blackett-Dibinga. Yogini and businesswoman Blackett-Dibinga recognizes the bravery and hope it takes for people to walk into a Bikram yoga class for the first time. Many times they have tried other strategies to cope with their physical ailments, whether it's with medication or surgery, but are hoping that stretching, posing, and sweating will work for them. \"We give people kick-ass workouts because that's what they're looking for. They're looking to challenge themselves,\" says Blackett-Dibinga. \"We want people to leave everything they have on the mat.\" ON THE WEB For more information, visit: https://bikramyogaworks.com",

We look forward to Amanda's leadership as she takes us through our next phase of growth. Her experience in the education space and insight will prove an incredible benefit not only to KIPP Massachusetts but more importantly to our kids and families.\" \"I'm honored to take on this important role,\" said Seider, \"and I'm grateful to Mike for his great work as chair. Through a period of extensive growth, both in scale and complexity, Mike has ensured we've stayed true to what makes KIPP great - a focus on strong results, a joyous, nurturing culture, and a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion at all levels. As I assume the chair position, I'm eager to lead the next chapter of our board's work. I'm very excited about KIPP's future, and to continue to support the incredible work of our students and families in this new capacity.\" Seider joined the KIPP MA board in 2011.

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"It was music I needed to experience and listen to after my mother's death,\" Dee Dee told the Banner. \"I needed to find something to lift me up and make me dance.\" Born in Memphis, raised in Flint, Michigan, having lived twenty-four years in France, and now a resident of New Orleans, Dee Dee's art absorbs and brings to life her deep appreciation for resilience and vitality. Whether it is scat singing, as she performed in Boston, or a song made famous by Al Green, like, \"I Can't Get Next To You,\" on her Memphis CD, you know it is Dee Dee's voice, she is that original and distinctive. Her show at Scullers featured a quartet of piano, bass, drums, and her voice, with songs made famous by Betty Carter and Billie Holiday. \"Sometimes I'm happy, and sometimes I'm blue,\" sang Dee Dee. Her physicality on the stage evidenced her work as an actress, winning a Tony in 1975 for her performance as \"Glinda\" in \"The Wiz\" and the British Laurence Olivier Nomination for Best Actress in a Musical starring in the London production of\"LadyDay\"inl987 Dee Dee spoke to the Banner about her life and music. Q: As a woman in jazz, what changes, if any, do you observe in both how fellow musicians and audiences regard your art over the years? A: I had to learn to assert myself as the leader of the band. And that didn't happen until the mid 1990s. I didn't like the arrangements of some of the songs, which happened to have been made by my bass-sist. I spoke to him, told him he needed to change them, and he was incensed. It was a defining moment to realize I am the boss. Two years later he quit the band. Look, jazz is a macho art-and it's a delicate balance for me as a woman. I have to be respected as the leader of the band, which is like a family. Q: Your voice is your instrument. Can you say a few words about that. A: The voice for me is the original instrument. So, for example, when I do my own solos, I'm speaking to other musicians in the band. It's most important to communicate with the band. I also recreate sounds like trying to recall Satchmo singing with Ella Fitzgerald. Q: Jazz creates a safe, sane place of calm and dignity, but at the same time the music does not lull one into complacency, does it? A: Not at all. Music that comes from an individual who is creating from a spiritual place is restorative. Not commercial. Q: Are there performers in hip-hop and popular music you enjoy listening to and feel inspired by? A: Well, when I get home from work, I love silence. No TV. What I've been listening to lately are the music of Dhafer Youssef, a Tunisian singer, and Oumou Sangare, a singer from Mali. I've recorded work that draws on Africa, like my earlier CD, \"Red Earth,\" a lot of which was recorded in Mali. I feel the need to reconnect to Africa. Q: Some musicians create a sound and stick with it. Others, like Miles Davis and Bob Dylan and you, reinvent themselves. Does the desire or need for reinvention come from within you or is it a response to your environment or some combination of these? A: My need for change comes from within me and it's something that can be effected by things around me, such as politics and fashion. The goal I have is to constantly challenge myself. I don't think there's anything worse than complacency. I don't want to relax. Most artists are about that constant need to create. I need to make an emotional connection to the music. Q: Finally, since we're in Boston, and you received an Honorary Doctorate from Berklee in 2015, what's your impression of the jazz scene here? A: Boston is probably one of the primary cities in the country for jazz. You have Berklee, and Boston University also has a great music department. There is a lot of music accessibility in Boston, it's a very open city in that way. And you know? I just think of Boston as a very creative city musically.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT This was the third year Handel and Haydn has sponsored community concerts under the \"Every Voice\" name, but it was the first year with two locations. The concerts are meant to bring the community together while celebrating underserved groups. Last year the focus was women, black Americans and children. This year Latinx, LGBTQand veteran voices were lifted. The celebration manifested itself in the program. For example, the work of Wilfred Owen, a sergeant in the British Army and a poet, was performed as a salute to veterans. The concert of early and modern music was split into three sections, and each group was exalted through music and spoken word. \"I would like to dispel the notion in this country that classical music is for old, wealthy white people,\" says Mobley. \"More than anything I think this is the music of the people, because sound can't be owned.\" This concert is just one of many cultural programs held in the First Church of Roxbury's Meetinghouse. The structure is the oldest surviving wood frame church in Boston and stands on a site that hosted a worshipping congregation from 1631-1976. The Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry moved in and took over care of the property 15 years ago. The Meetinghouse, which historically served as both a worship space and a civic hall, has undergone major exterior renovations and the UUUM is planning for interior renovations in the future. \"Our vision has been transforming it into a true meetinghouse for the Roxbury community,\" says Reverend Mary Margaret Earl. \"We're continuously having cultural events that benefit the community.\" The Meetinghouse has a strong historical significance. Famous abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and suffragette Lucy Stone appeared there for multiple speeches, and Garrison's funeral was held there. With history in mind, Mobley says that in 2016, just before the divisive presidential election, he changed the theme of the concert to \"Requiem for Division.\" He says, \"We decided to have one more funeral in the space. We put rest to the idea of division. It was then that I felt the bones of this place, standing at the same pulpit as William Lloyd Garrison.\" Mobley and Earl hope the Handel and Haydn Society concert, and future programming, serves to restore the community connection that the Meetinghouse was built to foster. \"If an audience member leaves not just entertained but interested in learning more about this history that's in their backyard,\" Mobley says, \"then I'm happy.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"Air Sea Land\" begins with light. Presented as an in-the-round geometric star shooting bright multi-colored beams towards the sky, \"Creation: Light\" marks the beginning of the sculptural journey and evokes the beginning of time. Here, San Miguel illustrates the way light has guided animals and humans alike in their development. The piece also references the Prudential Center here in Boston. Sometimes referred to as Boston's \"North Star\" that guides people downtown, the Pru glitters different colors for special occasions and sports games. The next Seaport installation sculpture, \"Creation: Water\" also ties evolution with Boston's history. Just as animals and humans developed from the water, so did the city. The organic shapes in this piece bring in San Miguel's pop-art influence. With the next set of sculptures, San Miguel illustrates two types of animals. His \"Diversity: Domestic\" illustrates a squirrel holding a pigeon. Both these animals are often found among humans, especially in the city. Anyone who has seen tourists cooing over squirrels on Boston Common can attest to the comfort of these animals in urban spaces. In \"Diversity: Wild\" San Miguel depicts a majestic deer in mid-stride. Deer are often seen running away from the human world into the woods and vegetation where they're safe. In this way San Miguel is illustrating a spectrum of natural creatures. \"Mythology: Being 1\" and \"Mythology: Being 2\" show humans interacting with and affecting the natural world. Part-human, part-animal figures remind the viewer how both animals and humans can change each other's ecosystems and adopt each other's characteristics, for better or worse. The final sculpture, \"Natural Balance: Coexistence\" depicts a human hand holding a dove and represents balance between humans and nature. \"Air Sea Land\" is also a call to action, a reminder that humans need to work in harmony with the natural world to survive. This commentary is especially poignant in one of the least natural areas of the city. What started as a piece of the Boston Harbor mostly submerged in water has been built by human hands into land, then into a shipping area and now into a trendy, urban living space. San Miguel's bright, bold sculpture walk reminds residents of the risk of turning their back on the natural world in favor of the bright, new and hard.",

The organization seeks to reinforce the dignity and worth of individuals, acknowledge and respect cultural, gender and other differences, and serve the community with vision and integrity. CBES is located at 2315 Washington Street in Dudley Square, Roxbury. Beverly Ann Rock, CBES Board President, said the board is delighted to welcome Vance to CBES and anticipates that he will build on CBES' solid foundation. \"We know the vital contributions Michael has made to the Boston community and our most vulnerable neighborhood residents during his years at Action for Boston Community Development,\" she said. \"We are very fortunate to now have the benefit of his strategic vision and outstanding program development skills here at CBES.\" A Dorchester resident, Vance grew up in Mattapan and joined ABCD as an Assistant Director at the Mattapan Family Service Center in 1993. He was soon promoted to ABCD Director of Field Operations. In 1999, he became Vice President of Field Operations, responsible for 14-17 Boston neighborhood sites, supervising directors and operations managers. Many of the sites provide elder services programs ensuring hot meals for seniors, assistance with housing and health care issues, fuel aid, tax assistance and more. He also supervised ABCD's Community Coordination, Housing and Homelessness departments with responsibility for several department budgets; oversaw the annual toy drive/Adopt-a-Family program and represented ABCD on multiple community boards; implemented creative staff development programming.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"Originally we had planned to have eight weeks of production,\" says the baker, who grew up in Dorchester's Codman Square neighborhood. \"But because of limited funding, we ended up producing 48,000 in four weeks. It was crazy!\" Though Sweet Teez is formally a solo operation, Maynard hired 13 temporary workers to complete the mammoth task, and then permanently took on three of them as part-time workers. Maynard received a wholesale license for her business in September, and after being approached by Whole Foods, met with them in October. For the two-year-old bakery business, striking a deal with Whole Foods - in which Maynard's pies will be sold throughout the North Atlantic region's 42 stores - was a test of scalability. \"I went into the meeting with Whole Foods to talk about 2,000 mini pies in maybe two or three stores,\" says Maynard. \"But then they told me they liked my pies so much that they wanted to order 48,000 of them. I've never done an order this big before.\" Finding help Normally producing 1,000 baked goods a week, Maynard covered the costs of the dramatically increased production through loan financing from Boston Impact Initiative and Dorchester Bay Economic Development Corporation. \"It's terrifying, as a business, because that first week was so crazy. All I kept thinking was, 'This needs to work, because I took on this loan,'\" she says. With loan financing secured through a network of resources referred by Commonwealth Kitchen, the food business incubator in Dorchester out of which Sweet Teez operates, Maynard then had to find the right workers to complete the order. \"I brought the crew together really organically,\" she says. Some workers were recruited from the Boston Public Health Commission and Fairmount Collaborative, while others were borrowed from other food companies who share space at Commonwealth Kitchen. And a couple of Maynard's family members pitched in as well. \"One of my aunts came out of retirement to help me make pies,\" says Maynard. The large Commonwealth Kitchen facility was able to accommodate the scaled-up production, according to Maynard, with the kitchen's commercial oven able to bake 1,400 pies at a time. \"We have this huge tilt skillet where you can cook a lot of things at once, that's actually never been used before,\" she says. \"I was like, 'How is this my life? I'm really processing 160 pounds of cherries every day.'\" Maynard and her team also went through 150 pounds of flour a day. \"I normally buy a 25-pound bag of flour and that lasts me almost a month,\" says Maynard. \"I've used more ingredients in the past four weeks than I've used since I started this business.\" Luckily, Maynard says, \"As you scale up, at a certain volume, you pay less for bulk.\" Budget control In doing the numbers, Maynard says she came in under budget for some ingredients, such as fruit. She worked directly with Katsiroubas Bros., a wholesale fruit and produce supplier in Hyde Park, for the cherries, apples, and blueberries. \"We're looking to scale the business now, now that we know what our capacity is,\" says Maynard. However, she isn't necessarily expecting to fulfill another 48,000 mini-pie order anytime soon. \"We're expanding, but the growth is happening in a way that makes sense for us,\" she says. \"I don't want to grow too quickly and not be able to sustain it. We're trying to be strategic.\" Maynard says her business has a blended revenue stream that includes corporate clients, individual customer orders and wholesale. \"There are a few cafes interested in carrying our products in the near future,\" she says. Sweet Teez has built a roster of 300 regular clients, including Capital One and Boston Consulting Group. Maynard says doing business with Capital One was one of the main reasons she started making pies in the first place. \"I never used to make pies at all. I started off making cakes, cupcakes, and brownies. But Capital One calls me one day and says they want mini-pies, and I said, 'Yeah, sure!'\" Now, Sweet Teez sells pies year-round. \"Our pies are not super sweet. I want you to taste the blueberries and the cherries. I want the apples to taste like a hug,\" says Maynard. \"I want the pies to be vanilla-ice-cream-ready.\" Maynard's long-term goal for the business is to have her own production and retail space. \"I want to be able to do quick service in the front and have wholesale and catering going out the back,\" she says. Dessert lovers in the North Atlantic Region can now purchase Sweet Teez mini-pies at any local Whole Foods store, just in time for the holidays. \"Our slogan is 'Worth Every Bite,'\" says Maynard. \"Sometimes when you have dessert, it's not worth it. But we aim to be an indulgence, an experience.\" We're looking to scale the business now, now that we know what our capacity is. ... We're expanding but the growth is happening in a way that makes sense for us. I don't want to grow too quickly and not be able to sustain it, we're trying to be strategic.\" - Teresa Maynard ON THE WEB For more information about Sweet Teez Bakery, visit: www.sweetteezbakery.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Even with the sweetened version of the concentrate, the amount of sugar added is subtle. \"Per serving, you would get approximately 60 calories and 14 grams of sugar, which is one-third of what you get out of a Starbucks cup of chai,\" says Thapar. Traditional Indian chai is nuanced. Every cup of chai begins with three base ingredients of water, milk and tea leaves. Then you add the spices, and the possibilities of ratio and flavor are endless. \"Most chai will have some ginger,\" says Thapar. \"It's seasonal too. For example, cardamom is a more prominent spice in the summer.\" Their 750-milliliter pouch of Raw Spice Strong Brew Chai Concentrate makes 10 to 12 cups of chai. Consumers or cafes add their own milk and boil it with the concentrate in the specified ratio on the pouch. The concentrate contains a spice mix of ginger root, cinnamon, cardamom, fennel, dry ginger, cloves, black pepper and star anise. In contrast, most mainstream cafes in the U.S. make chai using a syrup concentrate, with preservatives, acidifiers, and a lot of sugar, says Thapar. \"Our mission is to educate people in America about the possibilities of chai - how to make it, where it comes from, the different notes and spices,\" he says. Thapar and Desai have created an instructional video for the Boston Chai Party website to show viewers how to make chai. In addition to the way it's made, Thapar says there's also a disconnect with the way chai is perceived. \"For us, chai is a cultural phenomenon, it's meant to be enjoyed with people. To me, it's normal to sit down, have a conversation and take a moment while sipping your tea or chai,\" says Thapar. \"Chai is that connection with others. It's a bridge between people.\" Starting up Thapar, who still works fulltime in computer science, says the business startup costs were minimal at first, but grew over time. \"In total, over the last few years, we've put about $50,000 of our own money into the company,\" he says. Thapar and Desai are the sole employees and sole owners of Boston Chai Party. Operational costs include renting a kitchen facility at Foundation Kitchen in Somerville, licensing, inventory and packaging. Thapar and Desai trademarked Boston Chai Party and hired a friend to design the logo. A brandnew package design is on the way, says Thapar. Customers can order a cup of Boston Chai Party chai at nine area cafe locations: three Barismo cafe locations, Wildflower Pantry in Brighton, True Grounds in Somerville, Union in Allston, Red Barn in Framingham and Seaport and Davis Square Donuts. Thapar says the business relationship with the Barismo chain was formed through a contact, but as for the rest, \"we just walked in, and talked to the owners.\" Boston Chai Party is slowly building up its retail business too. Pouches of chai concentrate are available for purchase at Wildflower Pantry in Brighton, Good Health Natural Foods in Quincy and Cambridge Naturals in Porter Square. They are priced at $13.99 each at Cambridge Naturals. The company also sells individual chai ingredients, such as Assam black tea leaves and spice mixes on its website, and has been a vendor at SoWa Farmers Market. Thapar says they had to prove to cafe owners that their premium product was worth the premium price. Boston Chai Party's wholesale price to cafes is about a $1 per serving. \"Cafes are used to paying a lot less. They sell customers a $4 cup of chai after getting the concentrate for less than 50 cents per serving. However, cafes are able to get back that 50 cents because more and more customers are coming back for the chai,\" says Thapar. The Kendall Square Barismo location, for example, has seen a 200 percent increase in sales of chai since the cafe started using Boston Chai Party concentrate, he says. \"This makes up for our premium pricing, and we have replicated this result in other cafe locations.\" Boston Chai Party makes its masala, or spice mix, fresh every week and sources its black tea leaves from Assam, India every six months. \"The masala we use in our products is the same masala we use at home and it's the same masala my mother uses at home,\" says Thapar. As someone who regularly visits India, where his parents reside, Thapar was able to scout out the right tea farm to import from. \"Rushil and I wanted to address the slavery and mistreatment that exists on some tea farms and make it part of our mission to source from a place with decent health insurance and a decent wage for their workers,\" he says. Challenges Boston Chai Party started off as a passion project for Thapar and Desai, who were co-workers at Massachusetts General Hospital at the time. An authentic cup of chai was missing in the mainstream market and the duo wanted to fix this problem. But it took a lot of trial-and-error to figure out how to turn the idea into a profitable company. They spent three years coming up with the idea for a packaged chai concentrate. \"Initially, our idea was to bring chai to the market in its most authentic form,\" said Thapar. \"But that would mean you would need to have a specific set-up in every cafe for customers to boil everything together and strain it. That's how you make chai in India.\" They experimented making the chai themselves and delivering it to office clients. \"We quickly realized it was a logistical nightmare,\" says Thapar. At one point, the company took a loss when a cafe deal fell through. \"We were in talks with this big cafe and ended up ordering a lot of bottles to sell our chai in, but the deal didn't go through and now we have all this bottle inventory,\" says Thapar. \"These are the sort of pitfalls you have to try to anticipate.\" They have put the bottle idea on hold for now until they can operate at a bigger scale. After a year of market research, the entrepreneurs learned that there is a cap on the amount of money consumers are willing to spend on a 15-ounce bottle of chai. \"Most consumers don't want to spend more than four dollars,\" says Thapar. \"But we couldn't get our costs below a point where that retail price would keep us profitable.\" For that, they would need to produce at a higher volume, he says. Sharing the chai culture Thapar and Desai are still learning how to grow their company and spread their message of what authentic chai tastes like and the significance it has in Indian culture. \"Almost every household in India drinks chai,\" says Thapar. \"My 2-year-old dips his morning cookies in my chai and my 6-year-old knows how to make it, although he s not allowed to make it on his own yet.\" The duo feels so strongly about educating U.S. consumers and baristas about real chai that they are willing to teach local cafes how to make it, regardless of whether they buy Boston Chai Party concentrate. \"So at least they make it the way chai has been made for centuries. We want them to serve an authentic product and not an appropriated one,\" Thapar says. \"People are passionate about their food and I can relate to that,\" he adds. \"Chai is my childhood and it's on display everywhere in cafes, markets, and stores. I want to share the true experience of someone growing up in India; I want to share the genuine experience of chai.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"The book is very autobiographical,\" says Aderibigbe. \"I grew up with many women around me who were beaten by men who were supposed to love them. This book is an attempt to go back in time and understand my childhood.\" The book is structured in three sections. The first is the protagonist's grandmother telling him stories of their family history; the second contains stories told by his mother and moments that he witnesses; the third is an elegy for the luture. By structuring the book as primarily told by other sources, Aderibigbe illustrates the ways children raised in these circumstances witness and understand abuse. As an adult he can now examine how this behavior was normalized in the society he grew up in. \"[A large number of] African women die from beatings by their husbands,\" says Aderibigbe. \"These things are kind of swept under the carpet. Many of them die so their kids can survive.\" This problem isn't isolated to Nigeria. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. \"How the End First Showed\" has already been awarded the Brittingham Prize in Poetry, a testament to the desperate need for works like this. Aderibigbe incorporates his African roots into his poetry stylistically as well. The book is sprinkled with Yoruba words and phrases, and the poet utilizes the cadences of the language and music of Nigeria. \"We salivated; slices of yam softened. / We chewed our teeth; slices of yam perished. / Mother smiled. Father arrived, / filled the room with curses; / his voice beat in our hearts, / as thunder on the walls of a building,\" he writes. His stanzas flow from the soft, slow descriptions ofhis mother to the hard, abrupt entrance ofhis father. Aderibigbe received his Master of Fine Arts in poetry from Boston University and currently lives in Boston's Back Bay. He's also pursuing his Ph.D. at Florida State University. His poetry has been published in the \"African American Review,\" \"The Nation,\" \"Ninth Letter\" and other outlets. On Dec. 10, the Harvard Book Store in Cambridge will host Aderibigbe for a free reading and book signing.

In his work as deputy COO for BPS, Grandson has worked to support the implementation of key initiatives across the operations division, including leading the operational superintendents team and serving on the BuildBPS leadership team. As interim chief academic officer, Grandson will oversee the Academic Support Services for Equity Team (ASSET) which currently includes the offices of Academics & Professional Learning, English Language Learners, Special Education, Social Emotional Learning & Wellness, and Opportunity and Achievement Gaps.

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"It's a great season to be sharing time with your family and what better way to do that than with a holiday performance?\" says Peterson. For the first time, Arts-Boston is also collaborating with the Cambridge Mayor's Office, though productions across the bridge have been among the discounted shows in the past. Tickets are available on the ArtsBoston website at up to 50 percent off for over 130 performances and dining experiences. This week the program will sell its 250,000th ticket and the purchaser will receive a special, celebratory surprise. Peterson says the program brings community members out to see shows they might not otherwise have considered. \"I would say around 50 percent of the people that go are seeing that particular show for the first time,\" she says. Peterson herself is taking her 93-year-old mother to see \"Christmas Revels\" at Harvard's Sanders Theater. \"Tafuta! A Young Child's Search for the True Meaning of Kwanzaa,\" a performance by OrigiNation Cultural Arts Center at Roxbury Community College on Dec. 15, is one of the offerings highlighting diverse artists. Sha-umba Dibinga, founding artistic director of OrigiNation, wrote the production to educate the public about Kwanzaa. \"The reason I wrote it is because in the city of Boston there aren't any productions that celebrate Kwanzaa,\" says Dibinga. \"A lot of people think it's a replacement for Christmas and it's not. It's also not just a story for African Americans. It's for everyone.\" \"Tatufa!\" follows a young girl who is being teased at school for celebrating Kwanzaa. As she begins to explore the celebration and meet other people participating in it, she learns the true meaning of the holiday. Local OrigiNation dance students make up the cast of the show, further cementing it in the Boston community. Dibinga says there are about four adult performers and the rest are children, some as young as 6 or 7- \"Some of them have never, ever been in a production before,\" says Dibinga. \"It's the best feeling to watch them perform for a full house.\" Tickets for \"Tafuta!\" are on sale at ArtsBoston for $10 each, 50 percent off the original price. Peterson says she plans to continue including a diverse group of productions in the Mayor's Holiday Special as the program grows. \"The arts belong to everyone,\" she says. \"It's important to see yourself represented on stage.\" It's a great season to be sharing time with your family and what better way to do that than with a holiday performance.\" -Catherine Peterson",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Julie Pierce Onos, a certified holistic nutritionist from Acton, Massachusetts, has been working with private clients for about a year. Prior to being self-employed, Onos says she worked full-time for a government agency. \"Sometimes it's hard. You go from having a steady paycheck to really having to hustle to get clients,\" says Onos. \"But the payoff is that I'm doing work that I really love.\" Some people decide to freelance because they don't have other employment options and do it out of necessity. In the \"Freelancing in America\" study, only 63 percent of surveyed respondents said they are freelancers by choice. The study defines freelancers as individuals who engage in supplemental, contract-based, or temporary work within the past 12 months. Only 29 percent of surveyed freelancers are full-time freelancers. Covering costs Ngoc-Tran Vu, a community organizer and freelance artist from Dorchester, says she does various artistic gigs for private clients, nonprofits and community groups. Her rates vary depending on the scope of the project, but some clients offer to cover the costs of materials, or provide a stipend of a couple hundred dollars, while others don't offer anything. \"I'm working towards being a full-time artist, but right now, it's not sustainable,\" she says. \"I rely on my full-time job.\" Vu is currently program director for the Association of Independents in Radio. Another study conducted by COMMERCIALCaf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9, a real estate listing and data provider, offers some insight as to why the majority of freelancers still maintain day jobs: housing and work space costs. COMMERCIALCaf\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9 used average monthly housing expenses, taken from RENTCafe's August 2018 apartment rent data, and coworking rates at We Work locations across the U.S., to calculate costs that self-employed workers might incur. The study found that in Boston, a freelancer working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, would have to charge clients $75 per hour for their services to afford an apartment by themselves and a dedicated deskatWeWork If splitting housing costs with a roommate, that rate decreases to $42.40 per hour. The average hourly rate charged by U.S. freelancers is $38 per hour, according to a 2017 survey published by Hubstaff, a time tracking software company. Boston freelancers making $38 per hour would need to work 85 hours a week in order to afford both housing expenses and a private office at We Work, 80 hours a week for housing and a dedicated desk at We Work, and 77 hours a week for housing and a hot desk at We Work. Keeping overheads down Onos, who works as an independent holistic nutritionist full-time, keeps her operational costs down by working from home. \"I work mostly through the phone or through facetime with clients,\" she says. Her main service is a 12-week holistic health program called \"Nourishing Your Body, Mind, and Spirit.\" She also offers a special type of facial massage at a salt cave in Maynard, Massachusetts, part of a partnership she has with the spa where the salt cave is housed. \"Right now, I'm going to continue to work from home to keep costs down,\" she says. \"I don't have overhead in the sense of a workspace.\" Vu conducts her freelance work from home too, if the client does not offer up a workspace. Not having a separate dedicated workspace is something she keeps in mind when responding to freelance requests. \"It's challenging only when I have a big project that requires a big space,\" says the artist, who has worked on large-scale murals. \"But a lot of my work leans towards digital and photography work.\" She adds, \"For artists of color in Boston, it's a huge challenge if you don't have space and you can't work on public or large-scale art,\" which most likely would result in large-scale compensation. Setting fair prices for their skills and services in order to work sustainably and afford living costs is a common challenge among freelancers. \"In the art field, there isn't a rate guide,\" says Vu. \"There's no standard. It depends on your reputation and your relationship with the client.\" Onos says she does not disclose her prices upfront, since her services are highly individualized per client, but \"I'm definitely in the ballpark of other holistic nutritionists,\" she says. According to Thumbtack, an online service that matches customers with local independent professionals, private nutritional consultants charge an average of $60 to $90 per hour in the Greater Boston area. \"The biggest challenge was coming from being employed and then figuring out how much I should value my time,\" says Onos. \"Especially when you're excited about what you're doing. You'd like to do some things for free, but that's not sustainable.\" The biggest challenge was coming from being employed and then figuring out how much I should value my time. Especially when you're excited about what you're doing. You'd like to do some things for free but that's not sustainable.\" -Julie Pierce Onos BY THE NUMBERS A report commissioned by Upwork, a freelancing website, and the Freelancers Union titled \"Freelancing in America: 2017,\" found: 57.3 million: The number of free-lancing workers in the U.S. 36 percent: The percentage of the U.S. workforce made up by freelancers. 8.1 percent: The amount of growth in the U.S. freelance workforce between 2D14 and 2D17. 2.6 percent The amount of growth in the overall U.S. workforce between 2D14 and 2D17.",

Having served on the Board of Health since 2015, he is already aware of the current and emerging challenges and opportunities facing the commission's work today and I'm confident that he'll do great job leading the board.\" Lopes currently serves as president and chief executive officer of East Boston Neighborhood Health Center (EBNHC), one of the largest community health centers in the country.

After a few years outside the health center, during which he worked as a business consultant, Manny rejoined EBNHC in 2004 as vice president and chief information officer. In 2012, Manny was named CEO by the EBNHC Board of Directors and in 2015, became president. He becomes the first person of Cape Verdean descent to be named Chair of the Board of Health in Boston. \"I am ready to serve and drive forward the public health priorities and goals outlined by the Mayor and being executed daily through the vast programming offered by the commission and its public health and community partners,\" said Manny Lopes. \"I look forward to working closely with Executive Director Valdes Lupi, the BPHC staff, and my fellow board members to further advance an agenda that supports all Bostonians, so they can equally have every opportunity to thrive.\" \"I am excited to have Manny as chair and to work closely with him and our board to implement strategies and initiatives to advance the health for all Bostonians,\" said Monica Valdes Lupi, executive director, Boston Public Health Commission. \"Given his leadership at the health center, he has a keen appreciation for the public health challenges that our clients face and brings great energy and experience in innovating to this role.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The show was born three years ago when Witherspoon produced a shorter version of it for her church. Her pastor was so impressed, he insisted afterward that the show be expanded and brought to the public. The community came together to make the show a reality. The current iteration features new choreography by Jo-Me Dance in Hyde Park and six new songs. \"I do a large focus on the atmosphere in which the birth happened,\" says Witherspoon. \"I do it from the perspective of the African diaspora.\" A modern tale Witherspoon also has updated the story for a contemporary audience by adding more female characters. She includes the story of Elizabeth, the Virgin Mary's cousin, who was blessed with a child despite her advanced age and previous inability to conceive. \"Not a lot of women's voices are heard in the Bible, so I tried to bring those to the forefront,\" Witherspoon says. She also created a completely new character, the Sphynx, who acts as voice of good and reason to King Herod. Rebecca Zama, who plays the Sphynx, says, \"We're a hub of diversity in Boston and a lot of the time depictions of the nativity almost whitewash the story. We're telling it so that it's inclusive of the diverse reality of the time it's set in.\" The production was a community effort. Witherspoon, who has worked in the arts for decades, drew on contacts from all areas of expertise to make the production a reality. \"I tried to bring in a whole host of community people to make sure that, not only is it artistically sound, but that the community is involved,\" she says. Most of all, Witherspoon hopes to bring the joy of the holidays to the audiences. By including so many different artistic styles, she opens up the doors for people of all ages, backgrounds and tastes to enjoy the production. \"I have this wide spectrum of arts background, and I like to bring it all together. I want the audience to always be engaged,\" she says. \"I think this, at the core, is about the heart. I tell stories of love.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Grace is building a strong base for local musicians who are emerging. \"Bill Banfield, an instructor and guitarist over at Berklee, is an amazing resource,\" she says. \"He suggests talent to me who might perform here.\" Banfield is also the author of several books on culture, music and philosophy, including \"Cultural Codes: Makings of a Black Music Philosophy (African American Cultural Theory and Heritage).\" Coming up at DCBK, Grace says, \"We have jazz on Wednesday and Thursday nights as well as Sunday mornings, and our Jingle Bell Brunch on the 23rd of December is going to be a huge holiday jam featuring jazz and blues singer Valerie Stephens.\" More in the South End Down the street from Darryl's is Wally's, the always-reliable jazz club that has served as a space for musicians for decades. Every night of the week, from 6 to 9 p.m. the club holds jam sessions, and depending on who is playing, you have a shot at a memorable evening. The Beehive is another South End venue where jazz is often on the menu. No cover charge, but drinks and dinner are definitely part of the scene. One of the best acts featured at the Beehive in December is Noah Preminger, a Connecticut-born sax player who performs on Saturday the 15th. Preminger was the winner of Downbeat Magazine's \"Rising Star Best Tenor Saxophonist\" in 2017- Speaking of the sax, the same night Preminger is at the Beehive, you can instead attend the Friends of John Coltrane Memorial Concert at 8 p.m. at Northeastern University's Blackman Auditorium. Celebrating John Coltrane's music and spiritual legacy, the evening is hosted by Eric Jackson, legendary radio personality, and features the musical direction of Dr. Carl Atkins as well as renowned performers including Stan Strickland, Laszlo Gardony, Bill Pierce and Bobby Tynes. Other major venues Later in December, on the 28th, you may want to head over to Scullers, one of the best jazz clubs on the East Coast, where the Black Art Jazz Collective is holding forth on what they are calling \"post-bop originals dedicated to African American icons.\" Thirty dollars gets you in the door. On the other side of the river is the Regattabar, ensconced in Harvard Square's Charles Hotel. Sorry to say, there are no performances scheduled there in December until a New Year's Eve show, but don't lose hope. Plan ahead and you will have the rare opportunity to see and hear Ron Carter on Feb. 22 and 23, 2019- Carter is arguably one of the greatest musicians of the 20th century, having played bass with the Miles Davis Quintet from 1963 to 1968, and at 81 years old, he remains creative, resilient and inspirational. Old and new, Boston remains at the forefront of joyful jazz this holiday season.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Despite the bitter cold of the evening, residents of the Villa Victoria affordable housing community in Boston's South End neighborhood came together on Plaza Betances in an intimate gathering. The musical group Jibaro Soy, led by band director Aida Silva, graced the neighborhood with parrandas, or Puerto Rican Christmas caroling, and continued the music out on the plaza where people danced as they waited for the ceremony to start. \"Even though it's not as warm as it is in Puerto Rico right now,\" said Vanessa Calderon-Rosado, CEO of IBA, \"the people, the music and the dancing warms us all up.\" As 2018 draws to a close, Calderon-Rosado reflected on her organization's 50 years of community building. \"It was in 1968 when a group of Puerto Rican activists organized like we are tonight, to develop affordable housing and programs,\" she said. \"Thanks to those efforts, we are making great contributions to our beloved city,\" said Calderon. Walsh, who is assisting with the lighting of more than 30 Christmas trees across the city this holiday season, offered up remarks before the lighting countdown. \"I want to congratulate IBA on 50 years of advocacy, of pushing and fighting for housing, better education and better opportunities for our young people,\" he said. He continued, \"In the last couple of years we've gone through some ups and downs with our federal government, but it's organizations like this and leaders like Vanessa who have gotten us through difficult times - and we have good times coming.\" At the ceremony, cookies and hot cocoa were handed out and the Trustees Mobile Farmers Market held a pop-up shop by the plaza. The Trustees Mobile Farmers Market regularly sets up shop at community locations in Dorchester, the South End, Jamaica Plain, Roslindale and Roxbury. The mobile market provides affordable and farm-sourced food and accepts SNAP/EBT, WIC and Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program coupons. The culmination of IBA's 50th anniversary celebrations will be an event on Dec. 20 called \"50 Portraits of Villa Victoria.\" The event, at IBA's La Galena, 85 W Newton St., will feature a collection of photographs, vignettes, poems, paintings and other works of art created by IBA's youth program participants. The gallery opening will also feature music created by artist-in-residence Devin Ferreira and will be free and open to the public.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT CrossFit is a strength and conditioning regimen created by Greg Glassman in 2000, consisting mainly of aerobics, calisthenics and Olympic weightlifting. Caraballo has been training in CrossFit since 2012 and is currently a Certified CrossFit Level 3 trainer. There is only one level higher, Level 4 Coach. Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Caraballo moved to the states in 2000 and attended Penn State University, where he studied kinesiology, and then received his master's in exercise physiology from the University of Florida. Living in Boston since 2010, Carballo co-founded another CrossFit gym in Roxbury called CrossFit on the Hill and managed various Boston Sports Clubs locations across the state before striking out on his own in Eastie. Known around Boston as a CrossFit trainer, Caraballo says he received a phone call from a realtor about an industrial building in East Boston that would be an ideal location for a new CrossFit gym. \"The big industrial doors are good for ventilation, especially in the summer,\" says Caraballo. \"The high ceilings allow for rope climbs and the big space allows for advanced gymnastics skills.\" He adds, \"I live in Eastie and thought it would be a great opportunity to give back to my community.\" According to Caraballo, remodeling the space cost $20,000, which the building's landlord financed through a loan. Payment for the remodeling and the rent is $5,400 monthly. \"It's a higher rent than Roxbury, but these industrial buildings in Eastie are dying out because developers keep buying them and converting them,\" says Caraballo. The gym has 134 members, or \"athletes\" as Caraballo calls them. He says some of his members don't think of themselves as athletes, but, referring to one of CrossFit's difficult full-body squat exercises, \"If you're able to do burpees, then you're an athlete, because you did that yourself with your body.\" The gym employs 10 staff members - eight part-time coaches and two part-time administrative workers. Caraballo is the only full-time staff. To further develop the business, he says, his administrative staff handles the gym's social media channels and he works with a business consultant group based out of Kentucky (the founder is an old colleague of Caraballo's) on a monthly basis. For the past three months, CrossFit Jeffries Point has worked with a lead engine marketing company to implement Facebook ads in their business strategy, aiming to increase memberships through targeted ads. Facebook ads have helped generate $2,500 in sales with the gym's three-week introductory program, priced at $129 per person. Caraballo and his team expect to convert that into 10 long-term memberships with year-long packages priced at around $2,400 per person. Caraballo says in his four years of operation, he has never placed a for hire ad, instead recruiting coaches by observing athletes who come in and getting to know them personally. \"We're a relational gym, we all have conversations with each other,\" he says. If he sees that particular athletes interact well with other members and other coaches and have fully absorbed the CrossFit experience, he invites them to join the gym's six-month internship program. At the end of the six months, interns have the option to continue on and get their CrossFit certification. \"This recruitment process is a way to replicate and maintain the culture that we have here,\" says Caraballo. Caraballo says many of his coaches happen to be full-time school teachers and are skilled at instructing and communicating with others, a useful trait when managing five to 15 athletes per class. In addition to CrossFit regimens, the coaches at CrossFit Jeffries Point also guide athletes in nutrition and habit building. \"We're all about education and helping others gain a better understanding of what your body needs,\" says Caraballo. As a husband and father of two young children, Caraballo says the biggest challenge for him as a business owner is balancing time with his family. Luckily, he has cultivated a familial atmosphere at his gym, and gets to work with his wife, Sandy Caraballo, who is a certified CrossFit coach in addition to being an engineer. Working in the fitness industry means working mornings and evenings, says Caraballo. When his 7-year-old son gets out of school in the afternoon, you'll often find him at CrossFit Jeffries Point playing soccer with a makeshift net. Most of the gym's members live in East Boston. \"We have developed relationships with them,\" says Caraballo. Just last Friday, the gym hosted its annual Christmas party, where they raised $600 for the East Boston Community Soup Kitchen. As someone with experience in one-on-one personal training, Caraballo says he likes that with CrossFit, he can train a group of 10 to 15 athletes in one hour, as opposed to just one person per hour. \"The ripple effect is greater,\" he says. \"It's like throwing a tiny rock in a lake versus throwing a large boulder in a lake - and we're throwing it together.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Who should invest in the new fund? Anyone who can, organizers say. Working-class Massachusetts residents can start investing with as little as $50. While others will be large accredited investors putting in $5,000 or more, the hope is that a significant number of the investors are ordinary Bostonians who have a stake in the success of local neighborhoods and small business owners of color. \"Our hope is for thousands of people who are living in Roxbury Dorchester and Mattapan to be investors in the Ujima Fund, and for hundreds to ultimately receive lending from it. The goal is for it to be a mass community fund,\" said Aaron Tanaka, director of the Center for Economic Democracy and one of the Ujima Project's co-founders. Nia Evans, the Ujima Project's executive director, put it even more directly. \"If you live in Boston, you should invest. If you identify as a person of color or as a working-class person in Boston, you should definitely invest,\" she said. \"Be the first person to invest, and consider it yours.\" Ujima's evolution Seeds for the Ujima Project were planted when a study group made up of more than 40 organizations, business owners and impact investors and sponsored by City Life/Vida Urbana, the Center for Economic Democracy and Boston Impact Initiative gathered in 2014 to learn about community finance. The Ujima concept emerged and volunteers began to build interest with organizing and outreach. The urgency to create a community-driven economy in Boston was heightened by a 2015 Federal Reserve report that revealed the city's massive racial wealth gap. Historical barriers to home ownership and unequal access to education, employment and entrepreneurship contributed to this gap. Making matters worse, Boston is one of the fastest-gentrifying cities in the nation, with rising rents threatening to displace residents and businesses. Ujima's 2016 pilot investment experiment crowdfunded $20,000 from more than 175 people, who then voted to distribute loans to five local black and immigrant-owned businesses. One of those businesses was Bowdoin Bike School, which used its loan to purchase a point-of-sale system that increased efficiency and helped the business expand. Today, owner Noah Hicks De Amor and his team are preparing to open a full-service bicycle shop and cafe in Uphams Corner. An inaugural citywide assembly in September 2017 solidified Ujima as a membership organization. At that time, the fund was expected to launch by the end of 2017, but it took longer than expected to make final decisions and get all the legal paperwork in place, said Lucas Turner-Owens, Ujima's fund manager. Activity ramped up over the past year with 50 weekly member meetings, three neighborhood assemblies, and workshops on financial and political education. During a two-day citywide assembly in October, members voted to approve 36 specific \"good business\" standards to define eligibility for the Ujima Business Alliance. Businesses in the UBA gain greater community support and opportunities for anchor institution contracts and Ujima Fund loans. Ujima will vet businesses on factors like percent ownership by people of color, fair scheduling, supplier diversity, environmentally sustainable practices and eliminating the dual-tier wage system by which tipped employees are paid less than minimum wage. A non-traditional fund Several elements set the Ujima Fund apart from other community fund models, Turner-Owens said. Besides making lending decisions democratically, Ujima prioritizes community investors over larger investors. For instance, if there is a higher loan default rate than expected, the Ujima Fund pays back small community investors first, followed by higher-net-worth investors and foundations. \"This is not traditional,\" Turner-Owens explained. \"Most funds reward folks with the most wealth.\" In addition, Ujima intends to take a more sensitive and flexible approach toward small business borrowers. At the October citywide assembly, members hashed out and voted on some loan structure decisions that make capital access more friendly, such as not forcing entrepreneurs to put up homes or existing business assets as collateral. Growth and activity Ujima now has more than 400 members. About 250 are voting members, meaning they meet the criteria of identifying as people of color and/or working-class and Boston residents or displaced from Boston. Other member types include non-voting \"solidarity members\" - supporters who live outside Boston or who are not working-class or people of color - along with grassroots partner organizations and Good Business Alliance entrepreneurs and employees. The fee to become a member ranges from $25 for general membership to $5 for youth ages 14 to 24. Weekly meetings are held at City Life/Vida Urbana in Jamaica Plain. Member subcommittees focus on arts and culture, business support, youth engagement and anchor institution outreach and other goals. People can be members without investing in the Ujima Fund, and can invest without being members, but Evans emphasized the value of doing both. She urges Boston residents to \"not only become an investor, but a member, a shaper of what your investments are used for.\" For information on how to invest online or by mailing a check, see Ujima's website or email invest@ujimaboston. com with questions. A learning process Ujima Project member Darris Jordan serves on the outreach and recruitment committee. At a recent press round-table event held at Dudley Cafe (an early UBA member), the lifelong Dorchester resident spoke of his experience. \"When I first heard of Ujima,\" he said, \"I thought, this shouldn't really be so radical, this idea of people investing in their neighbors and communities and the businesses they frequent.\" But working in Ujima's outreach effort, Jordan has seen firsthand how much work and time it takes to bring the idea to fruition and to educate, convene and fully involve community members. \"It's been a learning experience, finding ways to bring people into the fold and make it less overwhelming,\" he said. \"What's most exciting to me is that we're laying the groundwork, giving something roots so it's here for a long time. Down the line, people will really have this [democratic economy] mentality - it'll be the new normal.\"",

She also co-founded The House Slam, a poetry slam venue at the Haley House Bakery Cafe in Roxbury that offers a free poetry slam and open mic events twice a month. \"I am eager and humbled to serve as Boston's Poet Laureate,\" said Olayiwola. \"I am excited to work directly with writers across the city's poetry spectrum to provide resources and build bridges between creative communities. With the City, I am looking to establish a youth poet laureate program, develop residential and workspace for writers and weave poetry into the everyday lives of Bostonians. Please look out for me in a library, classroom, lecture hall, City Hall, living room or street corner in the years to come!\" The poet laureate program, established in 2008, is a way to highlight literary arts and promote a citywide appreciation for poetry. The poet laureate's challenge is to inspire deeper engagement in the written and spoken word, while acting as an advocate for poetry, language and the arts. The poet laureate is charged with raising the status of poetry in the everyday consciousness of Bostonians, which she does by attending public readings, civic functions, and poetry events. The poet laureate serves a four-year term.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The larger space of the Shubert allows the show to have a live band on stage for about half of the dance numbers. In some cases, the band play with a recording for a fusion sound. Williams has upgraded the show's Boston set to include more notable locations, including his own Tony Williams Dance Studio in Jamaica Plain and the Hatch Shell, where the band is situated. The Russian dance scene will also include an extra number in the voguing style of the 1980s. Williams created \"The Urban Nutcracker\" in 2001 because he had been steeped in the dance since childhood but had never felt it reflected his identity as a biracial dancer. \"From the get-go, I was multicultural. In the early days, when I first started to dance, I was in a white world and I was mixed-race. And that made me feel inferior. I felt like I couldn't be myself there.\" And so he began creating something different with his dance school. At the time, hip-hop and tap classes were especially popular. \"I had recently heard Duke Ellington's rendition of the 'Nutcracker' from 1961 and I thought, 'Why don't I incorporate the jazzy hip-hop dances that I do?'\" he says. \"I took all these styles and I stewed them together.\" This year, the show will feature Khalid Hill, the original tap teacher of the Tony Williams Dance School, in the prologue. A dance group from Harlem will also join the cast for a few steps. Williams hopes audience members, seeing dancers on stage who look like them, will be encouraged to pursue the art. He hopes to continue growing the diverse casting in future years. Williams says he created \"The Urban Nutcracker\" for everyone, and he hopes that's who shows up to see it. \"It's a show that's not just for daughters and moms, but for everyone. It's got humor, pathos and high-level ballet dancing.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"I try to always look at our archives and see what music was performed in 1865, when H&H musicians originally celebrated Jubilee,\" says conductor Scott Allen Jarrett. This year he chose excerpts from Mendelssohn's \"Saint Paul,\" and Handel's \"Judas Maccabeus,\" which tells the story of the first Ha-nukkah celebration. PurceU's \"Dido and Aeneas\" will also make an appearance, a little preview of the full score, which will be performed later in H&H's 2018-2019 season. The musical program will be rounded out with a spiritual arranged by Harry T Burleigh. \"He was one of the first African American musicians to be welcomed into the scene at the time,\" says Jarrett. It will also include music traditional to the event, like \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" and \"Battle Hymn of the Republic,\" which was written by Julia Ward Howe, a soprano who sang with H&H in the 19th century. Poet and performer Regie Gibson will read from the Emancipation Proclamation to top off the hour-long performance. \"What I hope our audience will recognize is that throughout H&H's history, we have used this music to reflect our current times. It was true in 1863 and it's true now,\" says Jarrett. Each year that the concert has occurred, the MAAH has centered it on what was going on in the corresponding year in history. This year the event will explore the 14th Amendment, passed in 1868, which formally defined citizenship and the rights therein. This is particularly timely, as what it means to be a citizen of the United States is continually explored on the contemporary political stage. Jarrett says the power of the event is evidenced by how much it has grown. The initial Jubilee concert was performed in the African Meeting House in Beacon Hill to a crowd of 200 people. Since then the concert has moved to the Back Bay and ultimately to Trinity Church to accommodate the growing crowd. The concert is free, but seats are first come, first served, so it's recommended that audience members arrive early. \"I think it's very special to our audience members to be able to connect with the history of civil rights in this country,\" Jarrett says.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The mayor-appointed system began nearly 30 years ago after some admittedly dysfunctional times on the elected Boston School Committee. Yet that's not the whole story. The successful home rule petition giving Boston's mayor the power to appoint came after the Boston School Committee had been expanded and diversified. In disbanding the elected committee, Boston removed 60 percent of its black elected officials. In fact, communities of color largely opposed an appointed school committee. When the Boston City Council voted 10-2 for an appointed board, the two 'no' votes were the two African American councilors - Charles Yancey and Bruce Boiling. In the state Legislature, many black and Latinx representatives voted against the petition for an appointed board. An American University study of city referendums found \"voters in predominantly black wards far more likely to oppose an appointed committee.\" Hattie McGinnis, head of Boston's Citywide Parent Council, advocated against an appointed board because it \"gives complete control to the Mayor for whatever he wants to do.\" McGinnis' warning is all too relevant today. Parents watch from the sidelines as Mayor Walsh and his appointed representatives make critical decisions about our children, our schools and our communities. Family engagement becomes \"messaging\" to get buy-in for already determined plans, rather than a genuine shared decision-making process. Nowhere were the problems of an appointed school committee more evident than Dec. 19 at Boston Public Schools headquarters in Dudley Square. Students, parents, teachers and community members, as they had for weeks, called out institutional racism, and challenged the narrative that their schools were failing and needed to be closed. Tears often accompanied the testimony, sad proof that those pleading to keep their school communities open were, in Ayanna Pressley's words, \"the ones closest to the pain.\" The school committee's vote (5-0, with one abstention) to close West Roxbury and Urban Science Academy offered painful proof that students and families are not the ones closest to the power. School committee members seemed genuinely moved by the stories, concerns and hopes of the West Roxbury Education Complex's students, families and teachers. But they voted anyway to dash those hopes. I think that would not have happened if Boston had an elected school committee. Or if it did, they'd be accountable come election time. The main arguments for an appointed system are that it takes politics out of decisions about Boston's schools, and makes the mayor accountable. But in the time between mayoral elections, students can begin and graduate high school. Or not, because their high schools are closed, with neither the mayor nor accountability in evidence. Politics, however, are very much present. No one gets and remains on the Boston School Committee without staying on the mayor's good side. That's politics in the negative sense of influence and patronage, rather than the positive power of voting. In a city school committee election, that electoral power could even be extended to 16- and 17-year-olds, or as San Francisco has done, by expanding voting rights to non-citizen parents. Former member of Boston's elected school committee and long-time METCO director Jean McGuire said, in explaining her opposition to an appointed school committee, \"It really concerns me that we would give up in Boston what we dumped tea in Boston Harbor for.\" This was in 1996, and referring to the Bill Clinton campaign slogan, Dr. McGuire added, \"It's democracy, stupid\" Democracy isn't perfect, but disenfranchisement is far worse. It's past time for Boston to return to an elected school committee. In convening a hearing last month on Boston Public Schools governance, City Council Education Committee Chair Annissa Essaibi-George took a first step. But we can't stop there. As Congresswoman-elect Pressley reminds us, \"Change can't wait.\" Mary Battenfeld is a BPS parent and member of QUEST (Quality Education for Every Student).",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Mayor Martin Walsh's Office of Economic Development, which currently works with 17 minority-and women-owned business enterprises through its technical assistance programming, highlighted six businesses that opened this year by Latinx entrepreneurs: JC Fruit Shop, Cacao, 100% Delicias Express, 21 Plus Smoke Shop, JPizzle Kitchen and Juicygreens. Also noteworthy is the launch of Ivyees \"Everything Honey,\" the first woman of color-owned retail business to open in Boston's North End neighborhood, this past November. Owner Ivy Lawson offers up skin care, hair care and other wellness products made with organic, raw honey. A very niche venture, Barber-Time Media Network is a minority-owned business that launched in 2018 to provide digital advertising and streaming media content for barbershops and salons. According to BarberTime's website, the company aims to \"create a better branding experience for our ad partners, better deals for their consumers and create residual income for the barber or stylist.\" Local expansion and growth Other businesses, such as Sweet Teez Bakery, Happy Supermarket and BikramYogaWorks successfully scaled up or expanded. Teresa Maynard, founder of Sweet Teez Bakery, fulfilled a 48,000 mini-pie wholesale order for Whole Foods this past year, her biggest order yet, with the help of a growing team. Happy Supermarket on Blue Hill Avenue in Dorchester, owned by brothers Francisco and Jose Fernandez, now has a second location on South Street in Jamaica Plain called Happy Supermarket II. The City of Boston's ReStore Boston program helped complete the architectural facade of the new storefront. National Bikram yoga studio chain BikramYogaWorks opened up a Boston location in October, their five other locations dotted along the East Coast. The founder of the studio, Kendra Black-ett-Dibinga, is a Dorchester native. City business resources Small business owners in the city, particularly entrepreneurs of color, face many challenges, including access to capital, access to legal counsel and navigating city permitting and licensing processes, and City Councilor Kim Janey held several public hearings in 2018 to address these issues. Walsh and the OED held a workshop series through the Small Business Center to assist new entrepreneurs in starting, maintaining and growing their ventures. The free workshops were offered throughout the summer in East Boston, Roxbury and Mattapan. \"We are so thrilled to see so many new and growing small businesses that are minority- and women-owned and definitely reflect the diversity and uniqueness of Boston's residents and neighborhoods,\" said Natalia Urtubey director of small business at the OED. \"To address the evolving needs of Boston's small businesses, we are proud to expand our technical assistance resources to support more non-traditional and micro-enterprise businesses.\" Independent business resources In June, nearly 280 minority-owned businesses received pro bono legal consultation and technical assistance from attorneys of 14 different firms at BizGrow, an event hosted at Suffolk Law School by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice. Latinx entrepreneurs in Massachusetts have found a new resource in PowerUp Latinx Biz, an economic empowerment initiative led by attorneys and community organizers Betty Francisco and Eneida Roman. The initiative launched in October and is connecting Latinx business owners with resources such as capital. And right before 2018 ended, The Boston Ujima Project launched the nation's first democratic and community-controlled investment fund. Hoping to raise $5 million by 2020 with investments from working-class Boston residents and large accredited investors alike, Ujima Project members themselves will be able to provide loans to Boston entrepreneurs of color, maintaining a stake in the development of their own neighborhoods. In 2019 and beyond, efforts to mitigate gentrification and displacement from Boston's currently booming development and housing market will continue to focus on economic empowerment and small business expansion for residents. We are so thrilled to see so many new and growing small businesses that are minority- and women-owned and definitely reflect the diversity and uniqueness of Boston's residents and neighborhoods.\" - Natalia Urtubey, director of small business, Office of Economic Development",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Drawing upon his 20 years at Madison Park High School in Roxbury, where he taught communication-arts-radio/TV production, as well as his role as executive producer of his own internet site, Sun-Music.net, Collins, who retired from teaching in 2011, took his passion for music and made it available to anyone with internet access. \"So much of music that's played on terrestrial radio is depressing and repetitive,\" he told the Banner. \"Even the jazz on Sirius is programmed by the musical directors rather than the DJs. But I can play pretty much everything I like. And so can Eric.\" Eric is Eric Jackson, the man who arguably is responsible for playing the best jazz on Boston radio over decades, whose ability to educate and entertain listeners is nonpareil, and whose deep voice is instantly recognizable. \"Eric is on 12 hours each day,\" Collins explained, \"with his automated playlist airing 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., noon to 3 p.m., 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. and midnight to 3 a.m. His show goes live on terrestrial radio, 89.7 WGBH, every Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening from 9 p.m. to midnight.\" Remarkably, Collins said, Boston does not have what he calls \"an urban radio station,\" and jazz and other genres of music heavily influenced by jazz aren't heard much over the airwaves. \"You have WERS,\" he said, \"and like other college radio stations, a lot that's played is influenced by whatever class is there at school that year - what's played is based on student populations.\" In order to fill that gap, Collins has worked closely with WGBH to carve out a niche over the past five years to create what is today a mini-universe ofjazz music. There is the website, the live radio shows by Eric Jackson, and numerous community-based partnerships that are reciprocal, supporting everyone involved in them. \"We have partnerships with Harvard Arts, the Cambridge Jazz Festival, Scullers Jazz Club and the Celebrity Series of Boston,\" he said. This spring, in collaboration with several partnerships, Collins is helping to highlight more jazz throughout the city. \"In mid- to late January, we're posting a documentary on the website about the jazz performances of 25 bands that played in a festival on the Esplanade along the Charles,\" he said. \"It was wonderful - they all played the same set simultaneously on the last Saturday of September.\" In February, it will be \"Live from Scullers\" via the website, with pianist Justin Kauflin on Feb. 1, and on Feb. 21, Warren Wolf, playing vibes. For April, during Jazz Appreciation Month, Collins is working on an event to honor the drummer Roy Haynes, who went from Roxbury to world fame, playing with Lester Young, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Stan Getz and John Coltrane. Along with his illustrious brothers Vinny, a well-known photographer, and Michael, pastor emeritus of 12th Baptist Church and a former state representative, Roy Haynes is legendary, and at age 93, he is still performing. \"I came up as a live jock,\" said Collins. \"So live or automated, I'm always a music guy!\" ON THE WEB Jazz 24/7: wgbh.org/jazz247",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Born in Chicago in 1943, Jones-Henderson attended the Sorbonne in Paris, France, earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1971 and a Master of Fine Arts from Maryland Institute College of Art in 2005. In the late 1960s, he became involved in the Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists, or COBRA (later renamed AfriCOBRA). During those years, he created large-scale figurative weavings that were showcased in the group's exhibitions. The influence of that weaving technique can still be seen in the color choices and pattern styles of his more recent works. Visual music In 1979, Jones-Henderson began to make his mark on Boston as executive director of the Research Institute of African and African Diaspora Arts, Inc. in Roxbury. He also served in academic roles at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design and Emerson College and was honored by the National Conference of Artists with the Award of Excellence and the Massachusetts State Senate with a Citation for Cultural Excellence. Though intimate in scale, the current exhibition showcases the breadth of Jones-Henderson's work both in media and style. Jones-Henderson is known for his mosaic-style works made with enamel painted tiles, but he's also created weavings and screen prints. \"I feel the exhibition is a sort of visual memoir,\" says Jones-Henderson. \"I'm very concerned with my works having aesthetic nourishment. They're visual music.\" Music is a theme throughout the show. One piece, titled \"A Few Words From the Prophet Stevie\" pays homage to Stevie Wonder. Another, titled \"Bebop Kuba,\" references the jazz sounds of the 1940s. The artist also includes a reference to Malcolm X. \"I thought it was quite timely in the location, so close to the [former] Charles Street Jail where Malcolm X spent some time,\" he says. Migration movements The exhibition title, \"River to River Deep,\" is meant to represent the Niger River in West Africa, where many African Americans are descendent from, and the Mississippi River, which many African Americans crossed when leaving the U.S. South. \"That reference is a poetic reference to water as a vital part of life worldwide, but specifically to the migration of the African people,\" says Jones-Henderson. The artist hopes \"River to River Deep\" will inspire people aesthetically and incite them to learn more about the history included in each title. Jones-Henderson says, \"I hope viewers will be moved spiritually to consider the larger landscape of humanity.\" ON THE WEB For more information about \"River to River Deep,\" visit: https://barrygrouprealestate.com/napoleon-jones-henderson/",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The other two contestants who pitched their businesses to a panel of judges and an auditorium full of people were food startup Vita Pura, founded by Vanessa Vajara and nominated by Commonwealth Kitchen; as well as software solutions business Langston Corporation, founded by Adam Taylor and nominated by Smarter in the City. The panel of judges were: Lakshmi Balachandra, assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Babson College; Rica Elysee, CEO of BeautyLynk; Biplaw Rai, co-owner of Dudley Cafe; and Glynn Lloyd, executive director of Eastern Bank's Foundation for Business Equity. The \"people's choice\" third-place prize was chosen by the event's attendees, who voted for the best business pitch via a smart-phone polling system. Marv Neal, host of The Urban Heat on 98.1 FM and founder of nonprofit 365 Dad, was MC for the night and catered food was provided by local businesses Jamaica Mi Hungry and Sweet Teez Bakery. \"Our goal is to supercharge our ecosystem for women and people of color,\" said Karen Kelleher, executive director of LISC Boston. Karleen Porcena, economic opportunity program officer for LISC Boston, said, \"Boston has a lot of resources, but it can sometimes be really disconnected. We want to bring those resources together and showcase a different narrative of what Boston looks like.\" She continued, \"Boston has had this narrative of being old-fashioned, dominated by white culture and tradition, and that narrative is changing with events like this.\" With the business contestants spanning various industries from technology and food to design and social events, Porcena said, \"All of the contestants are super creative and ambitious. They saw a need in the market and filled it.\" Sumu of Zainab Sumu Primitive Modern is from Sierra Leone and creates artwork and clothing while traveling to Northern African and Western African countries, basing her creations on the distinct culture of each country. Launched in 2015 after Sumu attended Massachusetts College of Art and Design, the brand has a South End showroom and pieces are available for purchase at places like SoWa Market and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Sanaa With Friends is a multicultural painting experience bringing people together of various backgrounds. Similar to Paint Nite events, Sanaa With Friends hosts guided painting events that are more culturally inclusive to clients of color. According to co-founders Downes and Johnson, Sanaa With Friends has hosted more than 70 events since launching, including birthday and bachelorette parties. Each painting event is highly customizable, and the company works with local artists who create artworks specifically for Sanaa With Friends' customers to recreate in a social setting. Express Cuts 10.18 is an on-demand grooming service that takes \"everything we love about the barbershop\" and brings it to the customer, according to Atmore. The mobile app platform lets clients with busy schedules book local barbers at their requested time and location. Vajara of Vita Pura pitched her business as an upgraded version of a traditional Brazilian snack made with crisped yucca flower and filled with cheese. Vita Pura's cheese puffs are not available on the market yet, but Vajara said her food product is extremely popular among friends and family and is made with all-natural ingredients. \"You won't feel guilty if you eat 15 at a time,\" she joked. Langston Corporation offers intelligent software solutions for the black experience, CEO Taylor said. The corporation's first product, the \"Black\" app, collects news and stories from the world's biggest influencers of black culture such as Essence or The Root. To combat Google search bias, the black app provides content that is socially and culturally relevant to black users. According to Taylor, the app has been downloaded in 92 different countries. \"We collected millions of data points, analyzed the data and pushed it to our AI engine,\" said Taylor. In response to a judge's question about using the term \"black\" instead of \"urban,\" Taylor said, \"It would not feel genuine to use urban, even though it has more mass appeal.\" The winners of the cash prizes will use the funds to further develop their businesses by implementing marketing campaigns, hiring new staff and focusing on innovation. \"Navigating the system for small businesses is so hard, whether you're trying to find a loan, a retail space, or build your credit,\" said Porcena. \"Our vision is to uplift both the talent and the organizations that are here helping the businesses day in and day out.\" LISC Boston provides funding, financing and technical assistance to community development corporations (CDCs), nonprofit developers, grassroots organizations, and policy and advocacy organizations throughout Massachusetts. Navigating the system for small businesses is so hard, whether you're trying to find a loan, a retail space, or build your credit. Our vision is to uplift both the talent and the organizations that are here helping the businesses day in and day out.\" -Karleen Porcena Our goal is to supercharge our ecosystem for women and people of color.\" - Karen Kelleher",

      "body": "FULL TEXT As the 2018 season progressed, Cora guided the Red Sox to win a franchise best 108 regular season games, the best in Major League Baseball. Remarkably ironic, the last Major League Baseball team to integrate its lineup, the Red Sox, had beaten the Dodgers, the first Major League team to integrate its lineup. Last year the Red Sox fielded the most racially integrated lineup in their 115-year history. For the majority of their 162 regular seasons games Rookie Red Sox Manager Alex Cora would start 10 players that included at least five African Americans or Latinos. Despite the team's establishment in 1903, it was not until July 21,1959 that the Red Sox added a minority to their roster: Major League Baseball rookie, 25 year old Elijah \"Pumpsie\" Green, an African American from BoleyOklahoma. But even then, he was only signed as a back-up player. Green went on to play the next three full seasons for the Sox '60,'6l and '62, mainly as a pinch runner or in a day-off replacement role for infielders. The Red Sox failed in those years to make it to the World Series. Pumpsie ended his Major League career with the New York Metsinl963. By contrast, on April 15,1947 the Brooklyn Dodgers had begun their season by starting at second base, in an everyday role, 28 year-old Major League Baseball rookie Jack Roosevelt \"Jackie\" Robinson. He was the first African American to play for a Major League team Robinson played his entire 10 year Major League career with the Dodgers, which won the 1955 World Series. He retired on October 10,1956. The Dodgers moved to Los Angeles the following year to start the 1957 season. Robinson had played the 1945 and '46 seasons for the Kansas City Monarchs in the Negro Baseball League and was an AH Star. As his fame spread throughout America, Major League teams began to invite Robinson for a tryout. The legend, disputed by some, is that one such tryout occurred at Fenway Park in Boston in 1946 during which South Carolina born, then Red Sox owner, Tom Yawkey supposedly was heard to have said, \"Get that n***** off my field\" The present management's abhorrence for any such attitude or policy culminated in April, 2018 with Yawkey's name being stripped from one of the streets bordering Fenway Park, restoring its former name, Jersey Way. It was Dodgers owner Branch Rickey who offered Robinson a contract for the 1947 season. When word got out that Robinson would be coming to Florida for spring training, there were threats to blow up the DodgersFlorida baseball facility. As a result, Dodgers spring training for 1947 was moved to Cuba. The significance of that move was not lost on President Barack Obama on March 22,2016 when he attended the historic exhibition Major League Baseball game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban National Team while on a goodwill tour to renew relations between the U.S. and Cuba. In an ESPN interview celebrating the 69th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's integration of baseball, Obama said about baseball,\" It can change attitudes sometimes in ways that a politician can never change, that a speech can't change.\" It has been said, if you want to understand America, you have to understand baseball, and if you don't understand baseball you can't truly understand America. Boston's racial climate has enjoyed major change over the 60 baseball seasons spanning 1959 Red Sox African American rookie player Pumpsie Green to 2018 Red Sox World Series champion Latino rookie miracle manager Alex Cora. Boston is overcoming its racist past. Racial progress in baseball and Boston public life are on the same path. Now it is time for Roxbury to journey into the future by enjoying the success of the Boston baseball miracle and ending its curse on the Red Sox. Jack Drewry is a Boston attorney and adjunct professor. Now it is time for Roxbury to journey into the future by enjoying the success of the Boston baseball miracle and ending its curse on the Red Sox.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Fort Hill Bar is one of Rox-bury's minority-owned and woman-owned restaurants, and owner Norvia Pena said she ultimately feels that new developments are beneficial to her business because of the increase in new luxury housing developments in the area. But Pena also can cite the 2017 renovation and re-launch of her business as a factor in her success. Pena, who is originally from the Dominican Republic, took over the bar well over a decade ago. When she bought it, she said, the Latin-American restaurant on the corner of Washington Street and MLK Jr. Boulevard was one of the only businesses in sight. The restaurant struggled to find customers. But now, she says, the area is changing, and Pena said that's great for her business. \"You have houses everywhere. They just built two wonderful buildings over there,\" Pena says, pointing out the front window of her restaurant. \"It's getting good.\" Pena took over the restaurant in 2005. For years before that it had been a strictly Dominican Bar. Pena herself immigrated to the US from the Dominican Republic with her family when she was 11 years old. Early on, Pena knew she wanted to revamp the business and create a neighborhood bar. She hired a consultant to walk her through the community process, to help her listen to Roxbury and see what they wanted. Through the process, she met with approximately 30 different people. \"Everybody said the same thing: They just want a nice place they can go and eat, they can have drinks, good food,\" Pena said. She invested in decorations to make the interior more inviting, renovated the foundation of the building, and hired a new chef to help her create menu items the community would want. In 2017, she re-launched the restaurant. At the opening, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh was present and Boston's Eater magazine covered the event. Since then, political candidates Ayanna Pressley, Liz Miranda, and Rachael Rollins all used the place for campaign events. As for the community, Pena says that she caters to everybody, not just Dominicans. \"When you come, you can see a group of African Americans, a group of Latinos, a group of whites, and they're all drinking, they're all eating together,\" Pena said. \"When I see that, I feel really happy. I wanted to be an everybody bar, and it's getting there.\" Mixed feelings on gentrification The owners of Dona Habana, a Cuban-owned Cuban restaurant at Melnea Cass Boulevard and Mass. Avenue in Roxbury, also recalled getting extra help at the beginning. Co-owner Nivia Pina said organizations like the Boston Redevelopment Authority and Nuestra Comunidad Development Corporation offered assistance, including grants, for businesses to stay in the community. \"Things definitely got better over the years,\" said Pina. \"People love our product, so the better the area got, the better our business got.\" But Pina has conflicting feelings about how current Roxbury gentrification affects the area and its residents. \"It's sad to see how people are leaving because they can't pay their rents,\" said Pina. \"On another hand, new people are coming and new business is created. So I have mixed feelings.\" A cafe with a mission Dudley Cafe in Dudley Square is another popular meeting place. Unlike Fort Hill Bar, it's relatively new, having just opened in 2015. Another difference from Fort Hill Bar is that Dudley Cafe's owners are very critical of gentrification in the neighborhood and citywide. Biplaw Rai, the cafe's managing partner, co-owner and co-founder, said he is angered by the other new developments in Roxbury. He said they cater to the wealthier newcomers to Roxbury, and generally aren't for current residents, as new buildings' rents are too high and restaurants are unwelcoming or expensive. \"I walk around the city and see all these new buildings and shiny stores. You hardly see people use it,\" said Rai. \"When they are [used], it's by a select few, for a short amount of time. It's like, why are we wasting millions of dollars if it's not serving the community?\" He said that in Roxbury, people are more aware when local businesses change hands or when new businesses open, than in neighborhoods like Cambridge, Somerville, and Jamaica Plain, because Roxbury residents \"have been through more changes.\" \"They know what businesses come into the Square,\" said Rai. \"They know how they operate, if they are not giving back to the community, and vice versa.\" Because of that, Dudley Cafe attempts to give back in different ways. Rai, who worked in food service prior to opening the cafe, partnered with Roxbury resident Solmon Chowdhury who lived in the neighborhood for 30 years, and owns several other restaurants in Boston, to open Dudley Cafe. Both men are South Asian and said they wanted the space to serve the minority community of Roxbury. Dudley Cafe maintains a strong social justice mission. The cafe names menu items after strong women, to remind people of \"feminine power,\" the owners say. They work to keep menu prices affordable, such as $5 for challah French toast or $2.50 for a bagel. They offer the space for nonprofits and groups like the Boston Cyclists Union, and never charge them to hold events there. Rai said he makes sure that he gets to know the people coming into the cafe, so everyone feels welcome. \"It's very easy for people to walk in and see like big glass windows, clean establishment, and have this mentality of like, 'I don't know if I really belong,'\" said Rai. \"It's about feeling welcome.\" Rai said it's not been \"an easy ride\" to make a profit or even to break even. Still, their commitment to the community maintains. When Dudley Cafe first opened, the owners reached out to local high school students, offering the students jobs first. \"It was a paid gig, not an internship,\" Rai emphasized. A fair wage experiment Rai cites Haley House Bakery Cafe, a nonprofit cafe nearby in Dudley Square, as \"an inspiration.\" Haley House opens up jobs to members of the community who face barriers to employment, such as having criminal records. Bing Broderick, executive director of Haley House, spoke about Dudley Dough, a Haley House spinoff that opened in Dudley Square in October 2015 with a commitment to offer its employees a living wage. However, with the fair wage program, which paid employees $15 per hour, Dudley Dough couldn't break even, and the pizza shop closed in 2017- Broderick also said many of his Haley House employees feel the [negative] impact of gentrification. Dudley Cafe's Rai admitted there is a lot he doesn't have control over in Roxbury, but he is passionate about his business continuing to do what it can. \"Obviously we can't change the fabric of what's happening, as far as gentrification goes,\" said Rai. \"But our philosophy is, 'Let's make an impact in things that we have the power to.'\" This story was published via special arrangement with The Bay State Banner Everybody said the same thing: They just want a nice place they can go and eat, they can have drinks, good food.... When you come, you can see a group of African Americans, a group of Latinos, a group of whites, and they're all drinking, they're all eating together. When I see that, I feel really happy. I wanted to be an everybody bar, and it's getting there.\" -Norvia Pena",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The multisensory, multimedia presentation follows two men who have experienced domestic violence and are working towards acceptance. Mascoll, who is a survivor of abuse himself, says it's important to raise awareness for the topic. \"I think it's difficult for men in general, but especially for black men, to talk about their emotions,\" he says. \"It's been such a survival tactic for people of color to keep quiet.\" Significant updates have been made since last year's performance. The show originally included only one projector; now it utilizes three to create a fully immersive experience. At Hibernian Hall, the production was shown in the round; at the larger Calderwood space it will be performed in a more traditional theater format with the audience facing the stage. Mascoll will also be sharing his own personal story in addition to the original accounts. The hour-and-a-half long experience will finish off with a talkback. The Boston Foundation will be filming this performance for future use. The talkback isn't just a way for Mascoll to discuss his artistic work; it's a safe space for audience members to communicate as well. Mascoll says, \"The last time we did the show we had four or five people disclose during the talk-back And we had the resources to get them help.\" In addition to his continued work on the \"Triggered\" stage show, Mascoll is launching a podcast with his partner called \"Living a Triggered Life.\" The podcast will discuss how to be in a relationship with a domestic violence survivor and how to support them. Mascoll says, \"Communication is key, and patience. Trying to be honest with ourselves first is important. Then we can share the experience.\" He plans to have psychology professionals as guests on the show to add an expert perspective. He'll also take calls. The podcast is being produced by Podcast Garage in Allston, and Mascoll estimates it will be available on their website within a month or so. In all his work, Mascoll aims to illustrate that this is an important topic to discuss and that victims shouldn't feel ashamed about their circumstances. He says, \"I hope people come away with hope, empowerment and awareness.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The performance celebrates the 125th anniversary of the Walnut Hill Arts School, an independent high school in Natick emphasizing the arts. The school was founded in 1893 by two Wellesley College graduates and served as a boarding school for girls for more than 80 years. Even then, the arts were at the forefront of Walnut Hill's educational programming. The school became co-educational in the 1970s and has been spreading music education and experience to students from all over the country, and globe, since. Rymer says, \"Walnut Hill and my training in Boston gave me everything I needed to have my current career.\" Going places Pianist Taylor Wang, a junior at Walnut Hill, has been studying piano for 13 years and hopes to go on to a professional career. She also notes that Walnut Hill offers more than just musical education. \"Because it's a boarding school, there's an aspect of independence and learning to manage your time,\" she says. This episode of \"From the Top\" will take place at the New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall. NEC has fostered a decades-long partnership with Walnut Hill. According to NEC, Walnut Hill's music department is the only high school program in the country linking a major conservatory (NEC) with an independent school. Rymer is an alumnus of all the organizations involved; he completed his bachelor of music and master of music degrees at the New England Conservatory and was one of the first recipients of the Jack Kent Cooke scholarship award on \"From the Top.\" His last appearance on the show was in 2005, and Rymer is excited to come back \"I think it will be a lot of fun to play with old friends from Walnut Hill and to see the new generation of musicians,\" he says. Guest host Lawrence Gilliard Jr., an actor (\"The Wire\" and \"The Deuce\") and Julliard-trained clarinetist, will facilitate the segment, which highlights young musicians who are still training at Walnut Hill as well as the graduates, like Rymer, who are flying in for the occasion. The recorded segment will air on participating stations and by podcast during the week of March 11. Tickets are free for students and start at $15 for adults. They can be purchased online. Rymer hopes that the accessible event highlighting young musicians will encourage others to pursue their dreams. He says, \"I hope the audience feels inspired.\" I think it will be a lot of fun to play with old friends from Walnut Hill and to see the new generation of musicians.\" -Tony Rymer",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Dorcena Forry is also co-chair of Suffolk's Diversity and Inclusion Council, formed on Aug. 1, according to her. Aldo Guerrero, risk manager at Liberty Construction Services, a subsidiary of Suffolk, said the new council is tasked with \"building a diverse and inclusive workforce where all are supported, respected, connected and valued.\" \"When the council began its work, it became clear we needed to understand and more broadly discuss what diversity and inclusion means in our workplace. This is why we're here today,\" said Guerrero before inviting Francisco to speak in front of a crowd of company employees and partners. Francisco, who has been at his role at State Street for two years, and once played football for the NFL, shared how he immigrated to the United States at age 17 and started his human resources career when he observed how homogenous corporate America was. \"I get to my first corporate gig and I don't see anyone who looks like me,\" said Francisco. \"And when I do, they are not in the same type of roles I'm in.\" Eager to get to the bottom of it and unsatisfied with his boss's response that \"We're having a hard time finding people like you,\" Francisco started volunteering at his company's HR department, analyzing their hiring practices and where they recruited talent from - usually elite college campuses. \"I asked, 'How come we don't go to an HBCU - an historical black university?'\" Francisco said. \"They said, 'Well, how good are those schools?' You start to unpack unconscious biases around education and what talent looks like.\" When it comes to creating the best team for a company, Francisco said, \"If you want to be the most innovative and competitive, you have to have people who can approach problem-solving differently, and think differently.\" Francisco said that he pushes the executive team at State Street to ask, \"How smart are we building our teams, how smart are we engaging with the people outside of the organization? Are we moving people equally throughout the organization? Are we judging people in the same way? Do we have systems in place to flush out biases?\" Surrounding oneself with people who are different is not a natural tendency, Francisco mused. \"All of us have biases and tend to gravitate towards people who are like us, make us feel safe and reflect who are.\" He added, \"There's nothing wrong with that. But I would challenge you to be able to work with people who don't think like you, to collaborate with people who have different opinions ... to analyze your network and how comfortable you are dealing with people who aren't like you.\" Francisco concluded his talk by naming leadership qualities he believes help companies succeed and build strong and diverse teams: intellectual curiosity, flexibility and humility. Follow-up questions Dorcena Forry continued the discussion by asking follow-up questions, many of which were submitted by Suffolk employees. In response to Dorcena Forry's question, \"What was the most impactful diversity and inclusion vision you've implemented?\" Francisco said, \"If we don't treat this work in the same way we approach business, then it's not going to succeed. We need to measure it.\" According to State Street's 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report, diversity goals were set across eight different categories to increase representation of women globally and employees of color in the U.S. Should company leaders have to address employees within the status quo feeling \"threatened\" by staff changes and an increased emphasis on diversity, Francisco said, \"You can't forget about the people already there. You need to tackle how managers who have been there 10,15 years are looking at it.\" He continued, \"They might be thinking, 'What does this mean for me if I'm a white male? Am I still valuable to the organization?' You have to do a lot of work internally, with everybody, so they understand what it means and the opportunities it creates for everybody.\" Dorcena Forry and Francisco discussed how to normalize diversity and inclusion within the company culture. \"It shouldn't be a completely separate issue from the rest of the work that happens at the company,\" said Francisco. \"The best way to start to have a conversation is in a way that's intertwined with how you talk about work, and then it becomes second nature for people to be like, 'Yeah, why wouldn't we want to do that?'\" Suffolk CEO John Fish has made new key hires in the last month, including appointing Lea Stendahl from E-Trade as chief marketing officer and Puneet Ma-hajan from General Electric as chief financial officer. \"There are different lenses happening here,\" said Dorcena Forry when asked about the Diversity and Inclusion Council's priorities. \"We're starting to track data to measure our diversity - we're looking at talent, internal mentorship, and how we're communicating.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"We unfold our voices to say what is violent to us or heals us,\" said Liceaga-Rojas during the show's introduction. \"Femme, queer, trans, nonbinary and cisgen-der women show their resistance and healing works based on their experiences and worldviews in a hetero-patriarchal social climate.\" With music, poetry and performance art, \"Poetry is Busy\" provided an interactive experience for audience members, who were asked to change locations twice throughout the night to observe two of the performances and stand face-to-face with the artists' emotions in an intimate setting. Elsa Mosquera Sterenberg, arts programs director at Inquilinos Bo-ricuas en Accion, which operates Villa Victoria Center for the Arts, said this year's event was dedicated to Latina artists. \"We're excited to host amazing people from all disciplines of the arts, including a very special poet and writer from Puerto Rico,\" said Sterenberg, referring to Raquel Salas Rivera, last year's poet laureate of Philadelphia. The lineup also included Lilly Evelet, a mixed indigenous woman and interdisciplinary artist; Kar-ishma Javier, a singer with an extended vocal range and ability to perform in 10 languages and 17 genres; and Bashezo Boyd, who goes by Bashezo, a multidisciplinary installation and performance artist who blends race and queer theory with African diaspora traditions and aesthetics. Olayiwola, in addition to being Boston's poet laureate, was the 2014 individual world poetry slam champion and 2015 national poetry slam champion. She identifies as a black, queer and hip-hop feminist and is a native of Chicago. Olayiwola performed an excerpt from a choreo-poem called \"Black and Ugly as Ever.\" Her performance began with song-like verses that repeated \"Stay out the sun\" - advice given to her while growing up in an attempt to minimize the darkness of her skin. The poet continued with a story from her school days: a fight between her and girl named \"Lata-sha\" over a boy named \"Michael\" who was a \"light-skinned boy with green eyes.\" \"We opened our flesh red on pavement. Lost our teeth to the grass. Swung each other around... even though Michael with his emerald eyes couldn't stand the sight of neither one of our dark-skinned asses,\" she said. Her style of self-deprecation continued as her performance concluded with racist \"I'm so black...\" statements, off-putting to the audience as she feigned laughter. \"I'm so black, I never got my college degree. I'm so black, I got pulled over on the passenger side. I'm so black, I'm ugly,\" she said. The audience then moved to the art center's gallery space for Eyelet's performance. Evelet began unpeeling multiple layers of clothing, which alternated between typical male and female styles of dress, with the help of audience members. Meanwhile, an audio track played in the background with a voice repeating phrases such as, \"Man or woman,\" \"I am neither,\" and \"I am both.\" The performer looked directly at audience members, almost defiantly. Finally, Evelet stood in the middle of the room, their layers of clothing strewn about, in nude undergarments as they declared, \"I am non-binary.\" Back at the original stage space, Javier performed a powerful rendition of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" a song from the musical Les Miserables, and then an original song in Spanish while playing the guitar. With an upbeat tempo, and a lot of vocal vibrato, Javier's song fit into the Latin folk genre. For the second and last time, the audience moved into the gallery space for Bashezo's performance art piece. The audience did not get to see Bashezo directly however, but instead a cloaked figure, hidden beneath what looked like a pile of colorful rags. The hidden person moved as if dancing, but in eerily staccato movements. A bell could be heard each time the figure moved, and shoes began to fall out from under the rags, piling up under and around the cloaked figure. Bashezo was born and raised in South Philadelphia and is currently enrolled in an M FA program at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Common themes in their work include issues around race, gender, sexuality, homo/transpho-bia and microaggressions. Salas Rivera, published author of four books, read some of their poems at the show from their most recent book, \"lo terciario/the tertiary.\" They read the poems first in Spanish, then in English. The first, \"no se cambia una ch-aqueta por una chaqueta\" / \"coats are not exchanged for coats,\" describes a person attempting to pay down a debt, after working for 50 years. First, they offer their life, but when that's not enough, they offer up payments from friends, family and neighbors. Finally, the narrator finds an acceptable payment: \"You go to Philadelphia / to look for the coats much needed in order to pay the debt of your island.\" Salas Rivera also read parts from a triptych poem called \"La Independencia de Puerto Rico/ The Independence of Puerto Rico,\" which they described was written with the intention of expressing hope for the future. \"We are richer than stolen ports, we are more pirates than federal governments,\" and \"We owe no one shame, we owe no one small-ness,\" they read. \"We are more than what they say, more than what they imagined, and more to this day, than we have imagined.\" And then, \"Look at us closely, don't you see? We are beauty.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"Can you play 'Samba Magic?\" Monteiro asked Figgins. \"And turn it up, please.\" While the Basement Jaxx music blasted through the speakers, Monteiro led the high schoolers through a series of joyful combinations. Figgins and Dumas danced along, demonstrating the organic technique Ailey is known for. Student dancers on the sidelines busted their own moves while waiting their turn to show off their Ailey-inspired skills. After the class, the students had an opportunity to chat with the dancers, getting advice about colleges, career paths and training schedules. That one-on-one access to the professionals left the students beaming with excitement. Every year Alvin Ailey dancers contribute to the Boston community by conducting workshops and master classes in Boston Public Schools. 2019 is the 60th anniversary of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the group is celebrating with a year of special events and community activities. Both Monteiro and Dumas also participated in the Ailey company's outreach in Boston last year. For Dumas, these programs are especially close to the heart. \"I love doing outreach, because I'm a product of that,\" he says. A Chicago native, Dumas got his start in AileyCamp, another youth-oriented program sponsored by the dance company. That was the first time he realized professional dance was a career avenue for people of color. \"There are so many parts of African American culture that can be performed and preserved on stage,\" he says. Not all of the outreach comes in master class form; Figgins, Monteiro and Dumas will also conduct workshops with kids who have no prior dance experience, and movement classes for students with disabilities. All in all, their Boston visit will include sessions at Boston Arts Academy, the Kennedy Day School, the Boston Renaissance School and the Richard J. Murphy School. The Ailey company's North American tour will touch down in Boston in May. Several Boston Arts Academy alumni have graduated on to the Alvin Ailey cast over the years. William McLaughlin, Boston Arts Academy's dance department chair, says it makes a big impact for students to see the possibilities available to them. \"It's important for developing artists to see themselves in other artists that are successful,\" he says, \"whether that's in terms of race, socioeconomic status or gender identity.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Although experienced enough to open her own real estate firm, Andre says working with Thumbprint was the best option for her. \"It feels like home to me,\" she says. With Thumbprint, Andre launched a campaign in 2016 called the 90 Day Home Buying Challenge. \"We got about 1,000 calls from people interested,\" she says. \"We started educating people on what it takes to buy a home and understand how real estate works.\" She continues, \"Before, it was only those who knew, knew. But we wanted to open up the conversation to everybody. This should be something that is talked about at the dinner table. A lot of people in my community lacked these conversations.\" Mentoring clients Since that first homebuying campaign in 2016, Andre has worked one-on-one with various clients who, three years later, are still in the process of becoming financially strong enough to buy a home in the Greater Boston area. \"Some people have defaults on their credit, or really low credit and no savings,\" she says. \"I spend 60 percent of my time educating people and connecting people with loan officers who tell them to work on X, Y, and Z before making a down payment.\" According to Andre, what every first-time homebuyer should know is that they should have a credit score of at least 580, but ideally at least 680 to get a lower interest rate. First-time homebuyers should also have at least $10,000 in savings and seek out pre-ap-provals for loans. \"Don't let student loans hold you back if you haven't paid them back in full yet,\" says Andre. \"Everyone has them, so it's not usually a huge issue.\" Andre is, in a way, going through the Home Buyers Challenge herself, working to purchase her first home in December of this year. \"I don't rush any of my clients to buy because I understand through my own experience about having to pay down debts and be in a better financial position,\" says Andre. Her career process, too, has been marked by patience and perseverance. Andre first took the real estate license exam as an 18-year-old, and then a few more times later on in her life after going to college and having two kids. As a young adult, she was deterred for a time from trying again, but by 2014, her perseverance was fueled by a bigger cause. \"I started seeing gentrification in Boston and I started asking questions,\" says Andre. \"My questions kept getting directed back to the developers. The city didn't really have answers for me.\" Mission-driven Concerned about how it was possible that elder residents and longtime families in Boston could be losing their homes and having to move outside the city, she started studying the market. \"I didn't go into it with a profit mindset,\" says Andre about her decision to try for her real estate license again. \"I wanted to better understand the market and teach people how to take advantage of it.\" Andre now works with sellers with properties in Dorchester, Roxbury, Hyde Park and Matta-pan. When working with buyers, however, most of them are currently looking for properties outside of Boston along the South and North shore, especially on Commuter Rail lines. \"I see elder clients looking into condos, [when] they no longer are able to shovel or take out the trash, young people who have lived in apartments their whole lives and want their own single-family home, and some people who just want to invest in real estate and have it be their residual income,\" says Andre. Longtime homeowners in Boston can take advantage of the currently strong housing market and create generational wealth, says Andre. \"People think they need to lose a house if they can't afford to maintain it or pay the property taxes. But Boston has programs and resources to help renovate old properties for homeowners, and then those homeowners can rent out their two or three family houses.\" One common scenario is longtime homeowners in Boston selling their aging and poorly maintained houses to an outside investor who fixes it up and makes double or triple what it was sold for. Instead, Andre says, \"We should be turning the homeowner into the investor.\" I didn't go into it with a profit mindset. I wanted to better understand the market and teach people how to take advantage of it.\" -Tayla Andre ON THE WEB Thumbprint Realty: thumbprintrealty.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT According to their faith, Muslim women must remain modest and cover their hair with the hijab in the presence of any non-relative males, but salons in Massachusetts are open to both men and women. \"It limits where you go,\" said Ahmed in an interview with the Banner. \"The only option for Muslim women around here was to befriend a stylist and have them come to your home.\" \"There should be a place for any woman, no matter her belief, to feel comfortable and safe and get the privacy she's looking for,\" she said. The salon, which opened in late February and is located at 1807 Washington St., has its wide storefront windows covered by neutral shades to ensure modesty for its clientele. Because the space is in a historic building, Ahmed says it took her over a month to get approval from the state to black out the windows. \"Nothing in this process has been easy,\" she added. The salon's interior is like stepping into your glamorous aunt's boudoir, with lush and sparkling wallpaper, twinkling chandelier light fixtures, velvet waiting chairs and a soothing mini waterfall by the entrance. Ahmed says she designed the place herself and invested in the buildout of the space, which used to be the office headquarters of her first business, International Translation Company. Launched in 2011, ITC is now based in Roxbury and provides interpretation and translation services in over 110 languages and dialects. \"I've been interpreting since a very young age,\" said Ahmed, who came to Boston from Somalia at age 9- \"My parents did not speak English growing up, so I was always translating for them.\" \"What pushed me to start the business,\" she says, \"was that I saw that there weren't enough qualified interpreters helping people and I wanted to change that.\" The translation business ballooned, currently employing over 689 contract interpreters and eight staff members. \"I outgrew this space,\" said Ahmed about moving the business from the South End to Dudley Square. A couple of years earlier, in 2013, the entrepreneur, who is also a Northeastern University grad, received her 1,000-hour cosmetology certificate and started thinking about opening her own salon. Unable to find another space big enough and within her budget to house all of her beauty services, Ahmed transformed 1807 Washington St. into the salon of her dreams. The studio is equipped with seven hairstyling stations, a Henna station, a nail station, hair wash and blow dry stations and a hammam spa room. The salon also offers facials, professional makeup, bridal packages, health and fitness consultation and hijab wrap services, in which the hijab is wrapped around the head in specific styles. \"They've been waiting for this,\" Ahmed said when asked how she got the word out to the community about her new salon. Throughout her career in Boston, Ahmed has remained involved in the local Muslim community. \"My faith encourages me to be a businesswoman,\" she said. \"There's the stereotype that Muslim women don't own businesses, but I wanted to defy that.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The Rainforest Alliance-certified coffee farm in Nicaragua is owned by the Ferrey-Machado family and managed by Leana and Carlos, Miriam's parents. Although the family in Nicaragua has been producing coffee for exportation since 1972, the Morales family has been roasting and selling Recreo's single-origin coffee locally since 2011. Fi Recreo Estate Farm is not just a coffee producer, but a humanitarian organization providing permanent and temporary work for local residents and elementary schooling, technical training and health services for employees and their families for over a decade. \"The motivation to launch Recreo Coffee Roasterie was to support the school and clinic we have on the farm,\" says Morales. \"We use a portion of our revenue to support those social programs.\" With 33 percent of Recreo Coffee Roasterie revenue going back to the farm, Morales adds, \"We're not a business making a business - we're a business making a difference.\" Business partners and spouses, Miriam and Hector met in Boston where they both went to college and attended church. Hector, a hy-drologist, and Miriam, an industrial engineer, worked in their respective fields for some time before they became ministers for the Church of Christ for 22 years. They left the ministry in 2011 to continue the coffee legacy of the farm, first by selling bags of un-roasted coffee to other roasters and then, after teaming up with a roaster, selling them to customers at farmers markets throughout Massachusetts. \"I had no experience selling coffee,\" says Morales. \"We just Goo-gled coffee roasters in the U.S., went down the list and cold-called for three months, everyday.\" Their clientele grew large enough for the two to acquire their own roasting machine and open a brick-and-mortar cafe in West Roxbury in 2015. They opened their secondlocation in June 2017 at Boston City Hall. The baristas at both locations don hats made of burlap, the same material Recreo's bags of coffee are shipped in, along with red bow ties and black button-down shirts. \"I wanted them to be more elegant-looking than the typical barista,\" says Morales. The Diedrich IR-12 roaster that Hector operates at Recreo's West Roxbury cafe was a $30,000 investment. It roasts 25 pounds of coffee at a time and stays busy for at least 25 hours a week, roasting beans for both shops. Besides retail, Recreo offers coffee wholesale to other restaurants, cafes and catering companies. Each part of the business is nearly matched in revenue. \"We're not as big as we want to be in wholesale right now,\" says Morales, \"so we're focusing on growing that.\" The Recreo farm has the capacity to produce 10 containers of coffee per year, each carrying 38,000 pounds of coffee. According to Morales, the coffee is picked up in New York, transported to a warehouse in New Jersey and from there, distributed to other roasters. Recreo Roasterie takes in 30 bags at a time from the warehouse to Boston, each bag carrying 153 pounds of coffee. \"We're truly farm-to-cup. No one else touches the coffee until we sell it,\" says Morales. Recreo Coffee Roasterie usually goes through seven bags of coffee per week, transporting only what is needed from the warehouse to keep the coffee as fresh as possible. \"Coffee is affected by humidity and coldness. The warehouse conditions keep it preserved,\" says Morales. Over the course of a year, four containers from Nicaragua are shipped to the U.S., while the remaining six containers are sold to an exporter in Nicaragua. Morales says they'd like to get to a point where they're able to sell more of the containers themselves through retail and wholesale. However, the competition is fierce. \"You can get coffee everywhere and a lot of people want it for a low price,\" says Morales. \"But we're a single-origin, environmentally sustainable and socially responsible specialty coffee. We can't compete with Dunkin Donuts prices.\" As with any business, there are highs and lows, and through the low points, Morales says what motivates the couple is \"knowing we're making a difference. This isn't something that we're just putting back into our pockets.\" Morales tells the Banner that Recreo is looking into opening a third cafe location to continue contributing to its social missions. \"My goal is to open a boarding school for girls at the farm,\" she says. \"Usually girls, by the time they're 13, go to live with men and start a family, but I want to help break that cycle.\" Some customers in Boston have had an opportunity to travel to the Recreo farm in Nicaragua to see for themselves how the coffee they drink is really made, the human labor that contributes to it and the social programs their dollars help maintain. Hosted by the Ferrey-Machado and Morales families, Recreo's yearly \"origin trip\" is a $500, four-day immersive experience. Due to current civil unrest, however, Morales says they have put the trip on hold, at least temporarily. Creating a community is an integral part of the Recreo business model, the owners say. \"We are very family oriented,\" Morales says. \"We're very close to our customers and the people who work with us.\" ON THE WEB RECREO COFFEE ROASTERIE: elrecreoestatecoffee.com The motivation to launch Recreo Coffee Roasterie was to support the school and clinic we have on the farm.\" -Miriam Morales",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"Community Supported Film comes out of a mission to strengthen local voices and allow folks in underrepresented or misrepresented communities to produce their own stories,\" says Sheridan. The organization has previously run programs in Afghanistan and Haiti, but Sheridan says working in the United States was a very different experience. Many advocacy organizations are overburdened as is and so the onus fell on CSFilm to reach out to the community for applications. In other countries, the students work full time for six weeks, but here, the program became part-time for a longer period. Of 35 applicants, 10 were chosen for the program. Many did not have film experience, but they all had used narrative in some form and were engaged in community development. Twice a week, the group would meet to learn both storytelling and technical skills to execute their films. Sheridan says, \"Here it was much harder for the trainees, because they were having to carry on all the other aspects of their complicated lives as new immigrants, including economic challenges and family concerns.\" Mubarak Mwonge Nsamba emigrated from Uganda to Lowell in 2017. While developing his documentary, he also was dealing with enrolling his children in school. His film, \"Pulse of a Dream,\" explores why many Ugandans are funneled into health care jobs because they are accessible, regardless of what jobs they worked in Uganda. One of the problems Nsamba and other filmmakers encountered was hesitancy by people in immigrant communities to talk about their experience. \"Because of the current political environment and the stresses on the communities they were trying to document,\" says Sheridan, \"they went through an incredible number of stories that didn't pan out.\" As a result, Nsamba turned the camera on himself and his family while diving into the issue of new immigrant jobs. \"This program gives us a voice to talk about ourselves, to talk about the communities we live in,\" says Nsamba. \"I think it's kind of a platform for us to air out our views.\" The program has inspired many of its participants to continue using film to make change. Nsamba hopes to make a future film about childcare and the challenges of raising children while working multiple jobs in a new country. Abdirahman Abdi, an immigrantfrom Somalia who now lives in Roxbury, is already working on another documentary about gentrification in Dudley Square. \"It's not just about producing stories but having [the filmmakers] as spokespeople take them into the communities and open up discussion with them,\" says Sheridan. \"Our mission is to get these into as many communities as possible where people will come together and have their perceptions altered.\" ON THE WEB learn more about the project and the upcoming screenings at: http://csfilm.org/films/new-immigrant-and-ref-ugee-visions/#why",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Carter spoke with the Banner from her home in New Jersey. Banner: Why jazz? Regina Carter: I grew up with European classical music. And my first teacher, who taught the Suzuki method, would often tell my mother that for me, as an African American, to get work in an orchestra... It isn't going to happen. This was the '60s. That was my dream. It wasn't until I was at Cass Tech, in Detroit, where I grew up, that I first heard jazz - my best friend turned me on to jazz violinists. I thought, 'You can do this with the violin?' Jazz provided me with the opportunity to insert what I was feeling into the music. There's a foundation to it, but you also get to interpret. That's what jazz is to me- that's what drew me to the music. That and the groove. More than European classical music. In 2018, you were named the artistic director of the New Jersey Performing Arts All-Female Jazz Residency, which is described on your website as \"a summer immersion program for aspiring women jazz professionals.\" Tell me about that. Jazz pianist Geri Allen started this program, and we lost her way too soon - she passed away in 2017- So they called me to continue. We had an array of talented girls, and it was a very positive and uplifting experience. I brought in managers to teach them about the business and how to get gigs. We learned how to deal with negativity. It wasn't just a #MeToo moment. It was a chance for all of us to work together: How do you deal with a professor hitting on you? Or people being nasty or talking down to you because they feel threatened by your talent? We offer support. Your latest CD, released in 2017, is \"Ella Fitzgerald: Accentuate the Positive.\" How did you decide which songs to choose from the hundreds made famous by Ella? That was the big question. I knew that many musicians would be putting out recordings in honor of her 100th birthday. I didn't want to do the same tunes, like \"How High is the Moon\" or \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket.\" She sang such a broad range of songs, from country & western to doo-wop to soul. I chose songs that weren't famous - like a \"B-side\" album. And because the songs I chose weren't famous, that gave me the permission to play with the arrangements. Charenee Wade and Ray Angry did some of these arrangements. I didn't feel boxed in. You are so open to music. How did your recording \"Reverse Threads,\" released in 2010, come about? Growing up in Detroit, I was exposed to a lot of different cultures early on. For example, the city has the largest Chaldean community in the United States. The Middle East scale system also appeals greatly to me. And I did a lot of research at the International Music Institute in New York. Then someone handed me a recording of music by Ugandan Jews - I didn't even know! It ended up being a tree branch with a bunch of limbs and led me on this beautiful journey. Among performers now, across musical genres, who do you enjoy listening to these days? Right now, I'm so excited by Camille Thurmon, she's a young saxophonist in Wynton Marsa-lis' orchestra at Lincoln Center. And she sings beautifully as well. I also enjoy Jazzmeia Horn, a great vocalist. Another saxophonist I listen to is Lakecia Benjamin. What are your current projects? I love Afro-Cuban music, that's something I'm working on. And my other passion is that I'm a hospice volunteer - I'm working on music, sacred and non-sacred, that celebrates life and that state of transitioning. May I ask: What makes playing in Boston unique? I went to school here for two years at New England Conservatory, so automatically I get sucked back in when I'm here. The memories come back, it all feels very familiar. And there are so many music students. I think of Boston as a music town.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Tony Williams has been making waves in the Boston dance scene for decades. Growing up in Bromley-Heath housing development in Jamaica Plain, Williams became interested in dance early on. He worked hard to foster this passion despite economic and racial barriers. \"Boys and ballet, it wasn't done, especially if you were already part of a marginalized group,\" said Debra Cash, executive director of the Boston Dance Alliance. \"Tony Williams and Boston Dance Alliance share a mission of lowering barriers for underprivileged dancers. Throughout his career he has made it his mission to support inner-city kids - kids like the one he was in the 1960s.\" The hard work paid off. Williams was the first principal dancer of color in the Boston Ballet and he went on to perform with Joffrey Ballet, Royal Winnipeg Ballet, the National Ballet of Portugal and the Norwegian National Ballet. Back in Boston, he turned his attention to fostering diversity in dance, first with the Tony Williams Dance Center and then with the establishment of the annual \"Urban Nutcracker\" performance. In 2018, he established the City Ballet of Boston, a racially diverse company committed to creating opportunities for dancers of color. The Dr. Michael Shannon Dance Champion award is given annually to recognize a member of the Boston dance community over the age of 60 who has contributed significantly to the dance culture during his or her career. Community members nominate candidates and a panel of past Dance Champion award-winners chooses the winner. Previous recipients include Andrea Herbert Major, founder of Roxbury Center for the Performing Arts, and Jose Mateo, founder of Jose Mateo Ballet Theatre. The March 25 awards event included performances by several groups, including Jenny Oliver and Connections Dance Theater, who performed a vibrant piece titled \"In the Midst of Chaos, IS the Party!\" City Ballet of Boston performed a jazz ballet number, \"Ben's Trumpet,\" and the hip-hop group Ginette Christie Crew performed a routine to \"Ugly\" by Bubba Sparxxx. Ever energetic, Williams dwelled not on his past achievements, but on the work that can still be done to make dance accessible to all Bostonians. \"Dance transcends race, gender and socioeconomic barriers,\" he said. \"We exist to provide a sense of value to all.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"Golden Equinox\" features a diverse set of works, including air-ink pieces on handmade Nepali paper, acrylic paintings on wood and canvas, and aerosol and acrylic blends. \"Saya Patri\" blends traditional art historical methods with Shrestha's unique contemporary style in a triptych of acrylic-on-wood pieces that display her Sanskrit graffiti text in a semicircle. Here, the triptych format, associated in the Western art canon with religious images, is upended for a merging of cultural identities. Underneath the glowing yellow and orange text, transparent words float on a vibrant blue background. Originally from Nepal, Shres-tha is the first artist to combine Nepali letters with an American graffiti style. Though known for her street art, which can be seen in locations all over the greater Boston area - from Underground at Ink Block in the South End and Zone 3 at Western Avenue to Beyond Walls in Lynn - Shrestha's practice extends well beyond the wall. She served as a Boston artist-in-residence, established Nepal's first Children's Art Museum and has a long history of work with Artists for Humanity. Education and activism are as crucial to her practice as her spray paint can. Shrestha holds a dual degree from Gettysburg College in globalization studies and studio art and a master's degree from Harvard University. Her street art work was influenced by time spent with Boston's own Rob \"Problak\" Gibbs working in the Artists for Humanity program. Gibbs' experience in American graffiti inspired Shrestha to explore the medium in her own work. From there, it was a natural next step to incorporate her own cultural influences. After extensive research and planning for site-specific works, Shrestha's lettering is created through a combination of aerosol spray technique and acrylic hand painting. This process results in a dynamic, multi-dimensional style. \"Golden Equinox\" provides a closer look into the famed street artist and the intimacies of her artistic process. There may only be 13 pieces in the show, but there are unending discoveries to be made in the depths of her colors and the ease of her brushstrokes. \"Golden Equinox\" provides a closer look into the famed street artist and the intimacies of her artistic process.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Smith and Evans have been cultivating young vegetable greens, which grow up to three inches, from their home in Roslindale and have carried out their small-scale commercial enterprise from there. \"Microgreens can be grown anywhere in any small and controlled environment,\" says Smith, a former Boston Public Schools teacher and long-time gardener. \"But we'll be able to grow 10 times as much product and become a more efficient company.\" Microgreens are edible seedlings of vegetables and herbs grown up to the cotyledons, or first true leaf stages. Compared to mature plants, microgreens contain five times more nutrient density and provide visual appeal for chefs. \"There is a demand for fresh local products like this in Boston,\" says Smith. In addition to these tiny edible greens, We Grow Microgreens also produces edible flowers and subtropical plants. They sell their products in various farmers markets all over Massachusetts and in the city, and have a rotating client base of local restaurants, such as Harvest in Cambridge. Evans and Smith run their micro-plant enterprise with the help of six youth workers from nearby communities. Smith says they will consider hiring more workers at the larger space but plan to \"still remain a small-scale operation.\" When completed, the new farm will feature a 4,600-square-foot greenhouse in the southern, street-facing part of the lot, with small hoop houses Qow-cost simplified greenhouses) and raised beds toward the back of the lot. In the two-and-a-half years since the pair identified the city-owned lot at 21 Norton St., which used to be an abandoned dumping ground of trash and debris, Evans and Smith had to go through several community meetings to convince neighbors of the value of their project, as well as seek approval from 10 different city and state agencies. \"It was a slow, methodical process, but we felt supported the whole time,\" says Evans, who mentioned specifically the support of City Councilor Tim McCarthy, who lives up the street from the upcoming farm. Smith and Evans have wasted no time breaking ground on the lot since receiving a permit just a couple weeks ago. Additional investment for scaling up their business has come in the form of various grants. Funds awarded from the city's Community Preservation Act will help create a walking path for visitors, which will loop around the We Grow Microgreens farm as \"a little respite from the city,\" says Smith. Two grants awarded by the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture will help fund the farm's greenhouse and make it more energy-efficient with solar panels, a shade curtain and an insulated foundation. Managing their own farm as opposed to the densely packed operation in their Roslindale backyard will allow Evans and Smith to grow the business and diversify their offerings with more edible flowers, baby greens and herbs. The two are excited about the local buy-in for urban farming, which is part of a global movement with innovative strategies and tools, such as shipping containers and vertical gardens, popping up in every city. \"Many communities around the world are really thinking about food insecurity,\" says Smith. \"There is significant amount of investment around the globe for communities to be more self-sufficient.\" ON THE WEB We Grow Microgreens: www.wegrowmicrogreens.com Microgreens can be grown anywhere in any small and controlled environment. But we'll be able to grow 10 times as much product and become a more efficient company.\" -Tim Smith",

The Roxbury native first started working in the field under her father's heavy utility construction company, Webster Engineering Co., Inc., which was based in Dorchester starting in the '70s. When the company shut down in 2005, Webster worked for other major companies such as E.A. Fish Development and Janey Construction Management. From 2008 to 2014, Webster founded and ran an underground utilities company called Centaur Construction, LLC. However, \"it was a tough line of work and a very risky business,\" she said. \"You had to rely on so many different components in order to be successful.\" She soon changed gears and dived into consulting work by launching In Order Business in March 2014, drawing from her years of experience and network building. \"I packaged that all up and hung up my shingle. And the business just started coming,\" Webster said. \"I've been fortunate enough to build solid relationships throughout my career,\" she said when asked how she acquired her first client. She was hired by Brian McPher-son, who was leading diversity and workforce compliance at Suffolk Construction at the time, and is now the director of access and opportunity for the Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance for the Commonwealth. \"I expressed I wanted to identify diverse companies as a consultant and Suffolk happened to be starting a new project,\" Webster said. \"I was at the right place at the right time.\" This consulting job led to an even bigger one: The Encore Boston Harbor casino project, a $2.6 billion development and the largest private single-phase development in the history of the state. \"When they saw how I worked and how I went about implementing systems of diversity and tracking, [Suffolk] were negotiating the Encore project and they said, 'we want you back here,'\" she said. Webster set about implementing and monitoring the Encore project's business utilization and workforce goals. For diversity and inclusion in business utilization, the goal was at least 5.4 percent women, 5 percent minority and 1 percent veteran contractors. According to Webster, the project has achieved 12.6 percent women, 5.9 percent minority and 2.8 veteran contractors for the business utilization component of the development. For workforce goals among construction trades workers, the goal was at least 15.3 percent minority, 7-3 percent women and three percent veteran contractors. So far, the project has contracted 25.3 percent minority, 7-2 percent women and 5.4 percent veteran workers. \"The women participation number is unprecedented across the country,\" Webster added. In Order Business is a small firm with one full-time employee (Webster herself), one part-time assistant and two subcontract consultants. Webster says In Order has a dual role. \"Not only did I want to bridge the relationship between diverse companies and construction managers or the developers,\" she said, \"I also wanted to help build the capacity of the small, diverse businesses.\" To do this, Webster provides back office and administrative support such as finance strategizing, securing lines of credit and acquiring certifications. \"I want them to be prepared and ready to perform as well,\" she said of her clients. Assisting developers and general contractors with providing employment opportunities to minorities, women and other disadvantaged groups is \"something I'm truly passionate about,\" says Webster. Increasing diversity and inclusion is \"a win for everybody. It increases competition and can drive down costs by increasing the pool of qualified companies that developers and construction managers choose from,\" she said. And of course, the impact on small, minority and women owned businesses in Massachusetts is great too, says Webster, because \"it helps build their companies, increases their exposure and creates a positive impact on the communities they work and live in.\" Not only did I want to bridge the relationship between diverse companies and construction managers... I also wanted to help build the capacity of the small, diverse businesses.\" -Shelley Webster",

It's like Gaye was writing the music of the times right now.\" Thomas also wanted to pay homage to the fact that Gaye was born and grew up in Washington, D.C. The show is intended to spark conversations, and space is left during the performance for discussion and audience participation. \"Audiences move, they dance, they sing, they remember, they reminisce, they cry,\" says Thomas. \"There are so many emotions that happen within the performance experience for the audiences. And everyone takes them on this journey to look at then-lives, their loves, their social actions.\" The choreographer says he's enjoyed working with Boston artists and he's already planning how the troupe can return to the Hub for another run later in the year. The April performances in Boston will incorporate six local dancers in several group numbers. The dancers were selected from auditions and master classes with Urbanity Dance, OrigiNations and Dance Complex. Anmol Mehra, board chair of Urbanity Dance, who was instrumental in bringing the production to Boston, says it was important to bring the local community in on the project. \"It was also important to us to pay the dancers. In some cities I believe this is just a free opportunity, but I feel adamant that artists should be paid for their work,\" he says. He similarly selected Roxbury Community College to highlight a high-quality, underutilized art space. Though \"What's Going On?\" addresses the racial challenges at play in the contemporary world, Thomas says it is ultimately a joyful and uplifting message. He says, \"I hope the Boston audience walks away and find action to help turn the concerns",

I appreciate the out-of-the-box decision-making of college leaders to let a central administrator move into academic leadership,\" said Lima, who worked in Berklee's Human Resources Department. \"While similar moves have occurred previously, the path is not well-worn. Thanks for taking a chance on me (yes, ABBA pun intended).\" \"We are all very excited for Philip Lima in his newest role at Berklee,\" said Ron Savage, dean of the Professional Performance Division. \"A world class singer and person, his tremendous administrative expertise and deep understanding of the needs of developing vocalists make him the perfect complement for leading the college's largest private instruction area.\" Lima has sung leading operatic roles in Germany and for regional opera companies in the U.S. in repertoire ranging from traditional favorites by Handel, Mozart, Puccini, and Verdi; to important works of 20th century masters such as Samuel Barber, Benjamin Britten, and Viktor Ull-mann; to the comic masterworks of Gilbert and Sullivan. Of particular note have been his featured roles in the world premieres of operas by jazz greats Leslie Burrs, Nathan Davis, and Mary Watkins, and by award-winning composition professor Larry Bell. He has also appeared as soloist with the Boston Pops and over sixty orchestras, choral societies and concert series across the U.S. and in Korea and Ukraine in popular choral works of Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Faure, Handel, Mendelssohn, Orff and Vaughan Williams, as well as works by Bernstein, Dave Brubeck, Mahler, Ravel and Lee Hoiby. Lima, a resident of Roxbury, MA, joined Berklee in 2006 and most recently served as Assistant Vice President of Benefits, HR Compliance and Enterprise Risk Management.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Running through May 19 at Central Square Theater, \"black odyssey boston\" is a reimagining of the epic Greek poem that follows Odysseus on his mystical journey from war back to his home and his wife. Here the fabled hero is Ulysses Lincoln, a soldier trying to find his way home from Afghanistan to his wife and the son he's never met. But first he must overcome obstacles, connect with his ancestors and come to terms with his past. All the while the fate of the earthly characters is controlled by hilarious, heavenly gods including Great Grand Daddy Deus (Johnny Lee Davenport) for Zeus and Paw Sidin (Regie Gibson) for Poseidon. The mythical components of the show are balanced with history (the Civil Rights movement, Hurricane Katrina, slavery) and contemporary issues like police brutality and racial profiling. Unlike castle-dwelling Penelope of the original Greek \"Odyssey,\" Ulysses Lincoln's wife Nell is a working single mother in the projects trying desperately to keep her son safe and get him on the path to bigger opportunities. The small cast of 10 works overtime to make every minute of the three-hour production dynamic, entertaining and insightful. Dialogue is interspersed with spoken word poetry, spirituals, and Yoruba chants and narrative dances. Director Benny Sato Ambush was familiar with playwright Marcus Gardley and had seen one of the early productions of \"black odyssey\" in Oakland, California. Ambush was particularly impressed with the way Gardley had made parts of the show very specific to the area it was performed in. In partnership with HowlRound and Boston College, Gardley came to Boston in October 2018 to learn about the city and incorporate the surroundings into the Boston production. He interviewed 20 people, young and old, who had grown up in Boston's black neighborhoods to pull very specific, community-oriented images into the show. As a result, the production is peppered with familiar images like the Orange Line, Dudley Station and Mass Ave, and poetic lines like \"You're grand when you're a black man strolling in Mattapan.\" The performance welcomes white audiences, but doesn't cater to them - it's unapologetically black in a theater landscape that desperately needs that perspective. If there was ever a production to define the phrase \"melanin magic,\" this is it. ON THE WEB Learn more at: www.centralsquaretheater.org/shows/black-odyssey-boston",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Last year's inaugural festival drew more than 2,000 participants for hip-hop, spoken word and soul music by local and national artists of color at historic Franklin Park. It also featured local visual artists making murals, local vendors and food trucks with varied menus. BAMS Festival once again offers a day filled with music, entertainment, dance, art, spoken wor, and family-friendly activities. The festival is free and open to the public, but pre-registration is encouraged. Grammy-nominated R&B singer, songwriter and producer Eric Roberson headlines the festival, which also includes a line-up of 19 artists and musicians representing R&B, hiphop, afrobeat/house, jazz, fusion, funk and soul from around the country. Terri Lyne Carrington-a three-time Grammy Award winner, Berklee professor and artistic director of the Berklee Institute for Jazz and Gender Justice - co-curated the musical performances, which features Berklee singers \u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u2018BI, Dalaun and Safiya. The roster also includes Dorchester filmmaker and musician Cliff Notez; vocalist Aleecya; the R&B/neo-soul duo Optic Bloom; Motown and doowop quartet The Tee-Tones; the nine-piece funk and soul collective known as American Symphony of Soul; New England's premiere samba and Brazilian dance troupe SambaViva; and many more acts over two stages. Rob \"Problak\" Gibbs, who co-founded Artists for Humanity, and Racines Black Dance Festival organized both the art and dance components of BAMS Festival. Gibbs will present an interactive, live social justice artthemed exhibition with emerging painters and graffiti writers from New England. Racines Black Dance Festival will stage a workshop for attendees to learn both traditional and contemporary African and Afro-centric dance styles. A vendor market featuring artists, craft makers, creative entrepreneurs and minority-owned small businesses from across New England will be on-site at Franklin Park. Attendees are encouraged to bring favorite board and card games for a day of family fun. BAMS Festival is made possible in part through a grant from the Boston Foundation's Permanent Fund for Boston, Mass Cultural Council, and funding from Berklee College of Music; support from the Mayor's Office of Arts and Culture and the City of Boston; and media partnerships with WBUR, The New 97.7 FM, The Urban Heat, Ethnic Online, Dig Boston and the Bay State Banner.

      "body": "FULL TEXT And why get our compliant School Committee to take a vote on a general principle without any clear picture of what implementation might look like? The last time that happened was last year's vote on the principles behind start time changes, and we all saw how well that worked out. BPS continues to miss opportunities to create authentic community engagement in which students, families and the community share in finding solutions to the district's major problems. At the most recent school committee meeting, BPS administrators began a new cycle of rushed decision-making. BPS administrators presented several slides about current school configurations then responded to School Committee questions with vague answers. Until this point, BPS had begun to move forward on BuildBPS, never having School Committee officially taken a vote to dissolve middle schools or even sharing a long-term presentation of BuildBPS. As BPS peddles the rationale of \"right sizing\" the district and reducing student transitions, the ramifications of closing middle schools would affect black and Latino students at higher rates because middle schools are majority black and Latino students. There has been no scenario planning of feeder patterns between schools or an equity analysis of this decision. Because of weighted student funding, where a school receives a budget based on their enrollment, schools will experience declining resources either because BPS moves them to closure or because the feeder school from which they used to receive has closed. The BuildBPS plan does not answer fundamental questions: What are the long-term plans for the schools of my children, and the children across our city? How will the recommendations of the plan affect current students and communities? Yet, on June 12, the Boston School Committee will be asked to vote on the \"idea\" of a school reconfiguration model in which middle schools do not exist. The Boston Education Justice Alliance (BEJA) continues to call for a moratorium on the BuildBPS process, until a real plan is presented not just to School Committee, but to BPS school communities. The portions of BuildBPS that have been shared lack the following: * A 10-year timetable for facility maintenance, relocation, construction, and closure of our schools with swing space planning built in. * An analysis to determine if plans are equitable by race, socio-economic status, neighborhood, disability, and linguistic groups. * An impact analysis to understand the effects on students, families and neighborhoods in the city. * A financial report, including estimated costs for rebuilds, relocations, maintenance, program expansion, swing space, etc. * An educational plan regarding programs, grade configurations with school feeder patterns, extended learning time, student assignment, etc. Shortly after BuildBPS was announced, district officials announced the closing of the two schools in the West Roxbury Education Complex. To add insult to injury, the School Committee then gave the Rogers school in Hyde Park over to the city for disposition, never asking for surplus space from the city for West Roxbury students. BPS is making decisions under the false auspices of \"right sizing.\" Supposedly this is all for the benefit of students. But so far, BuildBPS has hurt some of the most vulnerable students in the city. This has to stop. Dorchester resident Ruby Reyes is executive director of the Boston Education Justice Alliance. \"BPS continues to miss opportunities to create authentic community engagement in which students, families and the community share in the finding solutions to the district's major problems.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The \"Seat at the Table\" project was inspired by Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's famous quote, \"If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.\" Chisholm was the first black woman elected to congress and persevered in her fight for racial and gender rights despite the challenges she encountered. Later she also became the first black woman candidate to run for the presidential nomination of a major party. The exhibit features chairs designed by community groups and activists to reflect the social causes and values important to them. Tonia Gilstrap, Troop 55302's site facilitator (effectively troop leader), says she was amazed by what the girls created. \"I was very proud that they were so engaged in current events,\" she says. \"The program shows that girls like themselves can do anything.\" The troop spent two weeks creating seven chairs, which are now on display at the EMK Institute. Many of them have empowering phrases like \"You matter\" and \"Keep shining\" on them. One features a black-and-white photo of Chisholm, framed with flowers. The project also was an educational opportunity, as representatives from the EMK Institute came in to provide information about Chisholm to the troop and host a question-and-answer session before the young artists dug into their paints. Girl Scout Troop 55302 of Dorchester is a part of the Girl Scouts of Eastern Massachusetts' community programs. These programs provide the Girl Scout experience at community centers and schools at no cost to ensure equal access around the state. These accessible programs function the same way as a typical Girl Scout troop and are available in all areas of Boston and in 14 towns in Greater Boston. Next month, 20 artists selected by a jury process will bring their own chairs to join the Girl Scouts' chairs in the installation. Participants include Massachusetts-based artists Jeffrey Chandler, Merill Comeau, Kris-tina McComb and Margot Stage and David Crane, as well as artists from Arizona, California, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and South Carolina. Gilstrap says her troop members were ecstatic when they visited the EMK Institute to see their work on display. \"When they saw it, they were awestruck,\" says Gilstrap. \"They were creating something that will be a part of history.\" ON THE WEB Learn more about the program at: www.emkinstitute.org/explore-the-institute/ exhibits/a-seat-at-the-table",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Leonardis Baez and his fiance Perla Rosario opened the shop last July, and have since added three part-time employees to their team. The idea for the shop actually started as a healthy nut bar. This was Baez' dream, having grown up in the Dominican Republic eating cashews, mostly right off the tree. It was Rosario's idea to sell chocolates as well. Her family has a cacao farm in the Dominican Republic, which is how the couple came up with the shop's name. The shop sells nuts and chocolates, but it's the chocolates that have really taken off. Baez moved to Egleston Square in the '90s and graduated from English High School, so it was particularly important to him to open Cacao in Jamaica Plain. JP is a great community and really supports small businesses, Baez says. Baez and Rosario also had their community in mind when pricing their products. \"We know not everyone has a lot of money in JP,\" Baez says. \"We're from here, so we understand that. We want people to come in and be able to afford anything.\" That's why their chocolates and nuts are sold by the pound, bringing most of the chocolates to around $1 a square. \"That's a constant battle,\" Baez says. \"Because we want to be successful, and in order for us to maintain a business, we understand that we have to price accordingly. However, we decided that our first priority was to make sure we have good quality chocolates at a reasonable price.\" And while Cacao's prices are low, their expenses are comparatively high - their prime real estate location on Centre Street, right across from J.P Licks, cost twice as much as Baez was originally aiming to spend. He poured his savings into Cacao, and the investments didn't stop at the front door. The shop's nut roaster, chocolate temper, blender and counters were big investments as well, each costing between $1,000 and $8,000. But business seems to be taking off. Anyone can walk into a shop once, Baez says. But repeat customers are what keep a business going. And that's how Baez knows they're going to be just fine - customers are returning. Some are even asking when they'll see a Cacao shop in their neighborhood. Expansion is definitely on Baez' mind. He's gotten expansion requests from Roslindale and South Boston customers in particular, so we may see a second shop in one of those neighborhoods soon. But for now, the young business is focusing on turning a profit. Baez says they hope to break even by the holidays, when business tends to skyrocket. And one day, the couple plans to make their chocolates from Rosario's family cacao farm in the Dominican Republic, making the shop \"bean-to-bar\" and further solidifying Cacao's family business feel. JP is a great community and really supports small businesses. So why not open my business in my own community?\" - Leonardis Baez",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Kate Gilbert, executive director of public art organization Now + There has been following Gibbs' career for decades. She had begun searching for an artist for the 808 Tremont Street wall last year. \"I really wanted to feature an artist of color because this is a community of color that's under threat of gentrification,\" she says. When she ran into Gibbs at BAMS Fest in 2018, she offered him the job on the spot. The mural depicts the same little boy from Gibbs' \"Breathe Life\" mural in Grove Hall, but he's a few years older and is carrying his younger sister on his shoulders. Both kids are beaming, bursting with joy and seeming to vibrate with life. Though the characters of the story remain the same, this mural has received a technological upgrade. Visitors can use the app Artivive to animate the mural. When the app is held up to the painted wall the children's hands move to sign \"Breathe Life\" in sign language. Gibbs says he has plans in motion for \"Breathe Life 2,\" which will be painted in Cambridge and will focus on the little girl. \"I think the sibling relationship between the two is positive to promote as well,\" says Gibbs. \"Kinship and brothers and sisters and cousins, anyone who can consider themselves blood, that's another positive reaction to highlight.\" The mural turned into a series by popular demand from the community. After the initial \"Breathe Life,\" Gibbs kept getting requests for others around the city. What started as one commission has blossomed into a movement. \"Breathe Life 3\" kicks off Now + There's \"New Codes\" season. \"We're really looking at breaking down codes of who gets to exhibit and where,\" says Gilbert. The season is slated to feature a number of other artists of color throughout the city. Gibbs hopes to spread delight through the neighborhood that turned him into one of Boston's most prolific street artists. He says, \"What's the worst that can happen, you end up smiling? I wanted it to be something that's as infectious as a yawn, something that was positively contagious.\" ON THE WEB Learn more about Now + There and the \"Breathe Life 3\" mural at www.nowandthere.org/breathelife",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The truck opened in summer of 2015 with the mission of bringing affordable and sustainable food options to Roxbury. The two owners met while working at the Food Project, a local urban farming initiative, and developed their business plan through a six-month business accelerator program at the Future Boston Alliance. At first, the truck was in Dudley Square three days a week, and they subsidized their low-priced menu options with proceeds from the higher-priced catering business for corporate clients, while keeping a low profit margin in order to maintain the affordability that customers in the area were used to from other food trucks and restaurants. The duo was able to make connections with local organizations that have missions similar to their own while working in Dudley Square, and because of that, were soon recommended to run the cafe at DotHouse Health. As early as year two of their business operation, they were selling to customers there five days a week. \"People can step right out of their doctor's office and into our cafe, and be encouraged to try something that they normally wouldn't eat, or something healthier than they would eat normally,\" Campbell said. \"Instead of going to McDonald's, you can come to us, and it's a lot healthier for you.\" Campbell said that the entrepreneurs have had some surprises in their experience with the cafe, including having their kale salad be a best-seller, something they never would have expected when they opened. Also, they've noticed customers switching from asking for fountain sodas, as was common when they started, to seltzer water and healthier alternatives. They've also had people ask at their food truck where the restaurant is - something that Campbell and Renshaw hope to be able to answer soon, with dreams of opening a brick-and-mortar space next year, once they find a suitable location. \"I think we're part of a larger community conversation happening in Boston right now, specifically Dorchester, Mattapan and Roxbury. I've seen a lot of businesses open up recently that want to offer healthier food options,\" Campbell said. \"It's really exciting, and I think people have been wanting this for a long time. I think it's something our communities need to feel good, raise their families, to make sure we're all healthy.\" The team is very intentional, Renshaw said, about sourcing their food locally and choosing sustainable options for plates and silverware, but also about supporting their employees. The business recently started offering 401(k) plans, something fairly unusual in the industry, and also offers employees and chefs access to management trainings and culinary workshops to help them develop their skills. Fresh Food Generation also makes sure that all its employees have food safety certifications, something that usually is required only for chefs. As they look to expand their business even more, Renshaw and Campbell will soon begin offering online ordering, which will allow them to increase capacity and efficiency for their customers. They will also be bringing their truck to farmers markets throughout the summer, including at Fowler Clark Epstein Farm in Mattapan, the source of some of their produce. While the business has expanded, the duo has stayed true to the reason they opened it in the first place: to bring healthy food to the area. \"The most important thing is to fall in love with the intention, not the invention,\" Campbell said. \"Our goal is to increase food access, to source from local farms, to create jobs and just feed as many people as we can. Our business model has pivoted, but our mission has stayed the same.\" I think we're part of a larger community conversation happening in Boston right now, specifically Dorchester, Mattapan and Roxbury. I've seen a lot of businesses open up recently that want to offer healthier food options.\" -Cassandria Campbell",

Prior to joining the Mayor's Office of Veterans' Services, Santiago served 20 years in the Navy in diverse duty stations including sea duty on four war-ships; and overseas tours in Belgium, Puerto Rico, Panama and Japan. Santiago participated in Desert Shield/Desert Storm, Eastern Exit, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. His final duty station was in Boston onboard America's Ship of State, the USS CONSTITUTION, which is the oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world. He retired from military service in 2008 while onboard USS CONSTITUTION. \"I am grateful to Mayor Walsh for this opportunity to serve the veterans of Boston,\" said Santiago. \"I remain dedicated to promoting the Mayor's agenda to serving all veterans no matter the zip code, status or orientation.\" Santiago is on the Executive Board of the Massachusetts Veterans Services Officer Association and is a life member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion. Santiago is also a member of the leadership team for the Homes for the Brave initiative which is part of the Mayors' Challenge to end Veterans' home-lessness. He currently resides in Jamaica Plain with his husband, Robert Torres. Formerly led by Commissioner Giselle Sterling, the Mayor's Office of Veterans' Services strives to recognize and engage our veterans and their families, advocate for assistance in their time of need and connect them with the services they've earned.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Born in rural France to a French mother and Kenyan father, Koyabe came to the U.S. as a toddler and was raised in the suburbs of Arizona. She was home-schooled as a child, and at the age of 9 enrolled in a theater workshop where she fell in love with musical theater. Being home-schooled prepared her for life as an actor in ways that attending a regular school might not have. It gave the French-Kenyan a lot more time to develop her interest and sharpen her skills in creative areas like dance (including ballet, tap, jazz, contemporary and hiphop), as well as voice and acting. \"It was a big asset for me because it gave me more of the freedom an adult might have while still being in school,\" says the now 18-year-old. \"I think the biggest hurdle to overcome was time. Having flexibility of my schedule made a huge difference.\" Koyabe made her stage debut in a production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\" at the Hale Center Theatre in Gilbert, Arizona. She also performed in regional productions of \"Bring It On,\" \"Sister Act,\" \"Annie,\" \"Hairspray,\" and \"The Wiz.\" In 2015, at age 13, she earned a spot on season two of \"The Voice Kids France\" during blind auditions with her stunning rendition of the Etta James classic, \"Something's Got A Hold on Me.\" When Koyabe landed the role of Alana, she had yet to see the musical. In fact, it wasn't until the first week of rehearsals that she saw the show for the first time. But she considers that a plus. \"I was familiar with the music, but I didn't really know all of the scenes my character was in. I didn't know the show. I hadn't seen it, so it was a lot easier to kind of come in and give my own spin on it.\" Koyabe, who has trained and worked really hard to get to this point in her career, says that one of the most rewarding comments she can hear after seeing the show, is, \"'I hadn't noticed Alana before, and I noticed her this time,' or 'I hadn't seen that she was alone, and I noticed it this time.'\" \"It's really cool to be able to be like, 'You can do this. It's possible.'\" - Phoebe Koyabe IF YOU GO WHAT: \"Dear Evan Hansen\" WHERE: Citizens BankOpera House WHEN:JuIylO-August4,as partof the 2018-2019 Lexus Broadway In Boston Season TICKETS: Tickets can be purchased at Ticketmaster by calling 800-982-2787; byvisiting www.BroadwaylnBoston.com; and at the Citizens BankOpera House Box Off ice, located at 539 Washington Street in downtown Boston, Mondaythrough Fridayfrom 10 a.m.to 5p.m.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT De Los Santo opened the first Delicias eight years ago, after quitting her job at a hair salon. Crespo says his mother realized that cooking is her passion and decided to try her hand in the restaurant business. And if you're wondering how Delicias gets that fresh-from-your-abuela's-kitchen taste, it's probably because Crespo's grandmother, Maria Mateo, cooks most of the food at the new location and does the final taste tests. Crespo says while he seasons a lot of the food, at the end of the day Mateo has final say. A family affair Besides Mateo, Crespo and Peguero, Crespo's grandfather is involved, handling food orders, and his uncle and cousin help out as well, making Delicias Express a true family-owned and family-run restaurant. Being part of a family business means coming to work is a lot more fun than you'd think. Peguero says she worked at a hospital and was juggling the restaurant part-time on weekends and nights, until she decided three weeks ago to work at the restaurant full time. She says it was a big change, from sitting behind a desk all day to laughing behind the counter with her fianc\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9 and challenging him to races to see who could finish their orders the fastest. \"We keep it fun,\" she says with a smile. And while Peguero is learning quickly how to cook the items on Delicias Express' menu, with her administrative background she excels in managing the business side of the restaurant. \"She takes care of the business side, I take care of the food side,\" Crespo says, who spent six years working in the food industry before taking over Delicias Express. Happy customers Besides the Delicias regulars -who Crespo and Peguero say are mostly employees of the businesses on Centre Street, from the health clinic on the corner to nearby restaurants - the restaurant also gets a fair number of tourists, who often ask the couple to open locations in their hometowns. And on the weekends, Delicias' clientele is mainly JP residents stopping in for a bite to eat. For some of them, it's their first taste of Dominican food. Crespo says his mother chose to open Delicias Express in Jamaica Plain because it the community is diverse. \"She said, 'There's something that's missing on this strip.' From the post office all the way to the rotary, you don't have true Dominican or Latin food. You do have Mexican options, yes, but there's so much more out there.\" With Jamaica Plain clientele in mind, the family added far more vegan and vegetarian options to the Centre Street location, and customers continue to recommend more. \"We added a vegetable mofongo,\" Peguero says, after a customer suggested it. \"And now we're getting to a point where it's time to reevaluate the menu again.\" The couple plans to add more vegetarian options, as well as possibly adding seafood back into the menu. The specials, which are offered on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, may also change. \"The Monday special right now is fried pork chops,\" Peguero says. Some regulars have begun coming in on Mondays specifically for this special. Crespo says with many of their regulars, he knows what they're going to order as soon as they walk in the door, and he starts preparing it before they even ask. \"They say, 'You already knew what I was going to order!'\" Crespo says, laughing. What's next? Although the couple is focused on establishing this new location and breaking even, which they hope to do before they hit the oneyear mark, they have begun to think about the future. One day they plan to expand, and Crespo thinks Brookline may be a good place to start. But for now, the couple is redecorating and perfecting the Centre Street location, with family and now a base of loyal customers to help. We've had customers say, 'This tastes just like my abuela's cooking,' or 'I haven't had food like this since the Dominican Republic.'\" - Lewis Crespo ON THE WEB 100% Delicias Express: www.jamaicaplaindominicanfood.com",

The Department also has jurisdiction over three active cemeteries, 16 historic burying grounds and two golf courses. \"I am very grateful for this opportunity to continue to work with the men and women of the Boston Parks and Recreation Department to create fun, safe and well maintained open spaces for Boston's residents and visitors to enjoy,\" said Woods. During his tenure with the Boston Parks and Recreation department, Woods has held roles as the Public-Private Partnerships Coordinator, Program Manager, and Director of External Affairs. Recently, Woods served as Deputy Commissioner where he oversaw more than 800 free annual programs for residents, department communications, and parks operations. A graduate of St. Michael's College, Woods also holds a master degree in Public Administration from Suffolk University. He is a lifelong resident of Dorchester, where he lives with his wife Lauren, a Boston Police Officer, and their two boys. Most recently, the Parks and Recreation Department celebrated the opening of Martin's Park, a first-of-its-kind inclusive, climate-resilient park at the Smith Family Waterfront. The department oversaw the project honoring Martin W. Richard, the youngest victim of the Boston Marathon bombings. Following continued investments in the parks system in Boston, last fall Mayor Walsh announced that Boston reached a major milestone in our accessibility to parks, with all Boston residents now living within a 10-minute walk to a park. The former Parks Commissioner, Christopher Cook, was elevated last year to Chief of Environment, Energy and Open Space for the City of Boston.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Since its inception in 2016, festival founder Fred Woodard has worked to bring major jazz musicians to Dorchester. \"Dorchester is my community,\" he says. \"The main objective for me is to create a music scene within my neighborhood. To create an event that the community becomes known for.\" For the 2019 festival, Woodard recruited his longtime friend Salim Washington to perform. Washington spent a number of years around Boston, where he received his Ph.D. from Harvard. He now lives and performs full-time in South Africa, but Woodard was able to snag him for the show during one of his tours back through the U.S. \"He's a pretty versatile guy and a good composer as well,\" says Woodard. Jason Palmer, a well-known Boston area trumpeter, will perform with Salim during the festival. In other local talent, audiences will see Gabrielle Goodman, a jazz vocalist and Berklee professor, and the Boston-based Lance Martin Jazz Trio. Goodman has produced five highly acclaimed CDs and is working on her sixth. Prior to branching out into her own work she performed as a backup vocalist for big names like Chaka Khan, Roberta Flack, Freddie Jackson and Patti LaBelle, among others. The Lance Martin Trio features Martin, John Baboian and Dave Clark, all of whom are music professors in the Boston area. The group is known for taking audience requests rather than playing off a traditional set list. This is because of their core belief that every musician should know at least 5,000 songs. The Fred Woodard Collective is trying a new tactic at the festival this year. \"My set list is going to be all original music,\" says Woodard. \"During previous years I've kind of mixed it up with jazz standards. But this year I went through all my original material and selected songs that I'd like to perform.\" One of those songs is \"Urban Garden,\" a piece dedicated to Woodard's students at the Roland Hayes School of Music in Roxbury. Above all, Woodard hopes the festival allows people to connect with their neighbors and neighborhood musicians on a personal level. \"Nowadays there's a lot of competition for people's attention and their time. There are a lot of different ways people can be entertained,\" he says. \"So when people show up, I'm really happy about it.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Gonzalez is working to help support existing micro businesses and help local entrepreneurs start some new ones. He is sponsoring House Bill 183, \"An act relative to the development of a strategy supporting micro businesses in inner city communities,\" which would establish a state Micro and Minority Business Strategy Committee. Micro businesses typically employ five employees or fewer and have yearly revenue of less than $250,000, and many are even smaller. Besides small retailers and restaurants, contractors, trucking firms and auto shops are among the ranks of micro businesses in black and Latino neighborhoods. \"They're a large segment of the businesses in our communities,\" notes Gonzalez, who prior to running for office headed the Latino Chamber of Commerce in Spring-field. \"They're 68 percent of the businesses in Massachusetts, and a large segment of them are in the inner city. It's where the largest segment of workers of color are employed.\" The committee outlined in his legislation would be an independent body housed in the state's Executive Office of Housing and Urban Development and would devise a strategy to work with micro and minority-owned businesses as a way to increase employment in communities of color, he says. Gonzalez, who previously ran a radio station and marketing company in Springfield, says many black and Latino entrepreneurs could benefit from assistance with business plans, financial planning, marketing strategies and legal advice on whether to structure a business as a DBA (doing business as) or an LLC (limited liability corporation). Once a business is started, even with a solid idea and plan, many entrepreneurs struggle with bookkeeping, which can set them back when it comes to seeking loans or other assistance and adhering to business regulations. \"The crucial part of a business is the recordkeeping,\" Gonzalez says. \"The biggest issue I had at the Chamber of Commerce was having to tell people they're not ready. I would tell them, 'You need an accountant to do books for you. You have to pay a meals tax.' If they say, 'What's a meals tax?' I would say, 'That's why you need an accountant.'\" Ideally, he says, the assistance his proposed commission would give to micro businesses could help them grow into larger businesses. \"Look at Merengue Restaurant,\" he says of the Roxbury eatery founded by Hector Pina and Nivia Pina-Medina. \"It started out as a mom-and-pop business. Now they own four restaurants. In Springfield, Acuna Real Estate started with two people. Now there are nine employees. Corner stores become supermarkets.\" Ultimately, the economic activity that starts with micro business enterprises helps to revitalize economically distressed commercial districts, as has been the case in areas such as Springfield, Holy-oke, Chelsea and Uphams Corner. \"When everybody else abandoned downtown, it was minority-owned micro businesses that kept those commercial districts vibrant,\" Gonzalez says. The Micro and Minority Business Strategy Committee would have nine members, according to Gonzalez's legislation. He says he would like to see the committee have funding sufficient to provide loans for micro businesses to open and grow, noting that such loans would cost far less than the tax breaks the state gives to large corporations and create more jobs. All members of the Massachusetts Black and Latino Legislative Caucus have signed onto the legislation, as have other Boston-area lawmakers, including Sen. Nick Collins, Rep. Tacky Chan of Quincy and Sen. Jamie Eldridge of Acton. If the government were to provide incentives for every micro business in the state to hire one worker, we wouldn't have 10 percent unemployment in these communities.\" -State Rep. Carlos Gonzalez",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"It's important to have a space that's welcoming for everybody,\" says Victor Quinonez, co-founder and creative director of Street Theory. \"We have a city that can be perceived as very academic and elitist sometimes, so it's nice to have something that you don't feel like you have to have a background in art history, you can enjoy it any time from any place.\" Quinonez, who also operates as a street artist under the name Marka27, has a wall in the 2019 Underground Mural Project. In its inaugural edition and in the 2019 lineup, the Underground Mural Project represents artist from a diverse group of cultural backgrounds and artistic styles. Genaro Ortega, the street artist known as Go-Five, is proud of his Taino heritage and hopes to bring that culture to his wall at Underground. He's painting two indigenous figures on his wall from 19th-century photographs. \"Everybody has a different story,\" says Ortega. \"There are so many different cultures in Boston, so being able to represent your culture and your art might make people feel comfortable with what's going on in the world.\" Underground at Ink Block is located at 90 Traveler Street on the eight-acre underpass between Boston's South End and South Boston neighborhoods. The diverse cultural attitudes illustrated in the mural project reflect the complex and varied cultural histories of both neighborhoods. The park opened in 2017 after a five-year process led by Mass-DOT in cooperation with the City of Boston, Boston Planning and Development Agency and the Federal Highway Administration. Since its opening, the site has provided public art, pathways, urban green space and programming to the surrounding neighborhood. On June 29 from 2 to 6 p.m., Underground at Ink Block will celebrate the 2019 murals with an opening party featuring the artists along with DJ Braun Dapper, food trucks, games and live art-making. The event is free and open to the public, but advance registration is required. \"When we have big events, it's probably when you see the most impact,\" Quinonez says. \"There so much art and culture in one space, and everyone is invited. It doesn't matter where you're from or your social status, it's very inclusive.\" \"THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT CULTURES IN BOSTON, SO BEING ABLE TO REPRESENT YOUR CULTURE AND YOUR ART MIGHT MAKE PEOPLE FEEL COM FORTABLE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD.\" GENARO ORTEGA ON THE WEB Learn more about the artists and the opening celebration at https://undergroundinkblock.com/new-page-3",

John brings to this role over 17 years of experience. It is clear that he is passionate about the rich history of this community and ensuring that resident engagement and leadership continue to be at the center of DSNI's work.\" Lloyd joins the community-based nonprofit at a critical time of complex challenges and dynamic opportunities as the Roxbury/ North Dorchester community it serves sees rising rents and the displacement of long-term residents. With a strategic focus on encouraging development without displacement and resident and youth empowerment, the organization is continuing to develop strong leaders to make its vision a reality. \"I am both thrilled and grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the DSNI community of partners, friends, and family,\" Lloyd said. \"I believe DSNI is at an inflection point at this period of time that requires a bold vision and the tenacity to achieve that vision. The DSNI community lives in a space where broad initiatives come together to affect positive change for individuals. A mission-based leader must lead from both head and heart. I have a genuine interest and passion for community development and look forward to working with the community at-large and stakeholders of DSNI.\" Established in 1984, The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative is a nonprofit, community-based planning and organizing entity rooted in the Roxbury/North Dorchester neighborhoods of Boston. DSNI's mission is to empower Dudley residents to organize, plan for, create and control a vibrant, diverse and high-quality neighborhood in collaboration with community partners.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Dawan-Abdullah entered the real estate business as a home flipper. With the assistance of a business partner, she started This Is My Home, LLC, a company specializing in finding, purchasing and repairing properties to rent on the market. The entrepreneur first discovered her passion for understanding and working with buildings while double majoring in Accounting and Business Administration at Northeastern University in the 1980s. \"I had always liked buildings,\" Dawan-Abdullah says. \"But, at the time, I didn't think I wanted to be a landlord and I didn't know anything else to be.\" After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree, Dawan-Abdullah remained eager to work with buildings, but uncertain about the path forward. Then, one fateful night, Dawan-Abdullah awoke to hear a man on TV discussing home-flipping. \"I was like, that's who I am,\" Dawan-Abdullah remarks about her revelation. \"That's what I am.\" To comprehend the basics of property renovation, she enrolled in a home-flipping school in California and subsequently flipped three out-of-state properties. Once her business partner left the property-flipping industry, Dawan-Abdullah controlled their shared flipping business in his absence. After reflecting upon years of experience in the field, Dawan-Abdullah encourages people interested in flipping homes to understand three things. First, to turn a profit while flipping homes, people should understand a property's value before and after renovations as well as the costs required to fund a lot's rehabilitation. Second, people should purchase promising properties with haste to avoid losing the lot to another buyer. Finally, flippers must understand the different expectations and needs of a contractor team in order to predict accurately the total costs for renovation. The initially reluctant home-flipper also offers insight into a few of the advantages and challenges of owning a property. Owning property increases financial security, she says. \"I will tell anyone, the advantage of owning a property is keeping the amount that you pay out of your income steady,\" Dawan-Abdullah says. \"Because if you are a tenant, the landlord can increase the rent at any time. You are not in control of your financials.\" She also believes that owning property lays down a secure financial foundation for future familial generations. As for the challenges, Dawan-Abdullah notes that some people enter property ownership with too many other financial responsibilities. As a result, many lose control of the property either through foreclosure or the premature sale of the property. Working for Keller Williams Dawan-Abdullah's experience with searching for homes on the market made it easy for her to start work as a real estate agent for Keller Williams, one of the world's largest real estate firms, in 2015. Dawan-Abdullah says the firm's approach to work management enables agents to focus on their jobs in the field. \"At Keller Williams, we are partners, as opposed to another type of firm, where people volunteer some of their time to work at the front desk or answer the phones,\" she explains. \"But we pay a fee so that the people at the front desk and the people who cut the checks have full-time permanent positions with benefits.\" Another central feature of Keller Williams' business model is its profit-sharing philosophy, she says. A seller, buyer or landlord enters into a contract with broker in exchange for support and resources from Keller Williams. A portion of the profits made from either the sale, purchase or revenue of a property goes directly to the broker. The broker then distributes the rest among all other associates involved in a sale. Because of the time-consuming nature of hashing out the technical details of a particular deal, Dawan-Abdullah strongly urges people to use real estate agents. \"It is a full-time job to try and find these people,\" Dawan-Abdullah says about the tenant vetting process. \"The landlords have other things to do. The landlord is going to tell me what they want and I will try to find what they want.\" Since properties in the Roxbury and Dorchester neighborhoods where Dawan-Abdullah does much of her business often sell quickly, she says her business model centers not around selling properties but instead around the general real estate needs of the community. She says she helps community members navigate anything from finding reliable tenants to affording the home of their dreams. Dawan-Abdullah describes herself as a person who deeply values relationship-building. She travels door-to-door to establish connections within the community and understand local real estate needs. This work is tough, but she prefers the in-person contact. \"I wasn't making a good enough connection over the phone,\" Dawan-Abdullah says. \"So I decided I would focus on my physical location.\" Dawan-Abdullah was born in Roxbury and grew up in Dorchester. As an added benefit of close ties to the community, she says she hears about listings directly from community members. What's next? Looking ahead, Dawan-Abdullah expects to continue working as a home flipper, landlord and realtor for the indefinite future. \"I'm not here to make you hate me,\" Dawan says about her role as a realtor. \"I'm not just trying to sell you something and get out of here. I am trying to say, okay, this is what we are going to do moving forward.\" She concludes with this company catchphrase: \"I want to be you and your family's realtor for life.\" I will tell anyone, the advantage of owning a property is keeping the amount that you pay out of your income steady. Because if you are a tenant, the landlord can increase the rent at any time. You are not in control of your financials.\" - Elizabeth Dawan-Abdullah",

The bank received a Main Street Award for its partnership with both Greater Grove Hall Main Streets and the Mayor's office. OneUnited Bank supported Technology Innovation Night, a public event that showcased the achievements of black tech innovators. Teri Williams, the president and chief operating officer of OneUnited Bank, also is the chair of the Black Economic Council of Massachusetts (BECMA), a group that works with the Mayor's Office to determine municipal funding for minority businesses. On July 29, Williams expressed OneUnited Bank's commitment to investing in community businesses and events while also highlighting the importance of recognizing the achievements of small businesses. \"We would do the work without the award, so it's not for the award that we do the work,\" Williams explained. \"But I do think it is important to recognize businesses within local communities that may not get the recognition of the bigger businesses that are downtown.\" Grove Hall volunteer Angela Williams-Mitchell, a volunteer at Greater Grove Hall Main Streets and a retired Boston Police Officer, received a Main Street Award for her cooperation with businesses whose primary language is Spanish. Williams-Mitchell, who is an immigrant from Panama, said in comments to the Banner that her time on the Boston Police Force taught her how to communicate comfortably with members of the community. Since retiring from the force, Williams-Mitchell has been involved with local educational institutions, community organizations, and the Greater Grove Hall Main Street Program. Williams-Mitchell explained her motivations for involving herself with numerous local organizations. \"I do a lot, but it's because I find that there is a need in our community,\" Williams-Mitchell said. \"A lot of people have agendas for why they do things. I don't believe in that. Today me, tomorrow you. If you don't help one another, there will be nobody around to help you when your time comes.\" Businesses: part of a community Mayor Walsh, in comments to the Banner, expressed the importance of both recognizing community businesses and shopping at local businesses. \"It is really important to recognize any of our businesses,\" Mayor Walsh remarked. \"Because when you think about a community, what's part of a community is housing, people living there - but it's also businesses. And we have to support them to keep a neighborhood thriving.\" In 2021, Boston will host the National Main Street Organization's national convention, an event centered around the development of Main Streets in America.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT As Mackenzie's confidence in his landscaping abilities increased, he realized that he could use his talents to run a landscaping business of his own. With only his grandmother's lawnmower, an iron rake, a spade and a shovel, Mackenzie and a business partner, who left after the company's start, founded Lawn and Beyond Organic Landscaping, a company working primarily in Dorchester, Roxbury and Matta-pan, in the mid-1990s. Though money partially motivated Mackenzie to create his own company, the landscaper says that a desire to provide job opportunities and to promote the preservation of the earth were his main reasons for founding the company. \"My objective when I started landscaping was, first, to provide jobs for people, to give them another way and to transform the community,\" Mackenzie says. \"That's my motto through everything in life. How can I make something better on the earth?\" Mackenzie's earth-centric approach to landscaping distinguishes his company from competitors in the landscaping business. When possible, Lawn and Beyond uses organic matter to either enhance the curb appeal of properties or to treat problems in the landscape. But Mackenzie says that the authenticity and integrity of his company allow for it to remain competitive with other businesses. Although Mackenzie often has fewer than six people on fieldwork, he still describes the struggles he faces as the sole manager of Lawn and Beyond. He characterizes himself as an aggressive, but open-minded and compassionate manager. The landscaper discussed the importance of caring in the landscaping business and the challenges he has faced when trying to manage his employees. \"It's been hard for me to manage different people,\" Mackenzie says about his position as the company owner. \"I am aggressive, and sometimes people take it the wrong way when I am telling them to do something. They might take it wrong, but I really am a loving person.\" To run a successful landscaping business, Mackenzie, who also co-runs Oasis Vegan Veggie Parlor and performs as a musician, maintains that a landscaper must possess three abilities. First, an individual must pay attention to the details to ensure the best final landscaping outcome. Second, because a landscaper's work on a single yard impacts the health of not only the surrounding properties but also the earth, a landscaper must see the picture larger than themselves. Most importantly, Mackenzie says that a person, no matter what career they pursue, must understand their personality and purpose on earth to produce valuable outcomes. \"What makes a good anything, is someone being aware of themselves,\" says Mackenzie about finding purpose in life. \"When they are aware of themselves, they become conscious and considerate to what's around them and then they are able to bubble up some stuff. But if they can't become aware of themselves, they are going to be lost.\" Mackenzie goes on to describe his obligation to use his talents for the betterment of others. \"It's about finding that niche with you,\" he says. \"What has motivated me is the question of how can I better something for others. It's not about me. It's more about: how can I create something that I can benefit from, and someone else can benefit from.\" To find purpose in life, Mackenzie suggests that people constantly question their surroundings and personal beliefs. Mackenzie explains that people are obligated to answer their questions truthfully. \"When you bring [the truth] to life, it eases the conscience and it opens up the way for you to now start doing things differently,\" Mackenzie says. \"That's why you have to trust yourself when finding yourself, so you can connect. If you don't start admitting certain things that you may have kept in your own darkness, you are not going to be able to grow.\" In the future, Mackenzie hopes to land a large property that he can use as a training ground for the next generation of community landscapers. Though the program would teach gardening techniques and outdoor management skills, Mackenzie wants the program to help trainees further understand the world around them and themselves. \"Let's find how we interdependently exist,\" Mackenzie says with enthusiasm. \"That will bring people to the consciousness of, 'No, don't take that paper and throw it on the ground.' I'd like to hire people and give them more understanding of themselves.\" \"My objective when I started landscaping was, first, to provide jobs for people, to give them another way and to transform the community. That's my motto through everything in life. How can I make something better on the earth?\" -Jahriffe Mackenzie",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Twenty-five years later, Porter's original idea is widely accepted, as is evidenced by the proliferation of national chain stores from South Bay to Mattapan Square. Now helmed by former State Treasurer Steve Grossman, ICIC has trained its sights on the undercapitalization of businesses owned by people of color. \"ICIC's mission has evolved,\" Grossman said. \"So we now are talking not only about how we can help businesses in inner cities realize their full potential by giving them the tools and the skills they need, but we're also talking about communities whose businesses don't have the resources they need to accelerate growth, to access the capital that they have not been able to get.\" Diego Portillo Mazal, who manages ICIC's Inner City Capital Connections program, said half of the business owners he works with say they have been turned down when attempting to access capital. \"A good number tell us they haven't even tried,\" he added. \"They're more likely to tell us they wouldn't even get it [if they tried].\" Building business ecosystems Launched in 2014, ICIC's Inner City Capital Connections initiative started in three cities and included 150 companies. Today it operates in 14 cities and is expected to serve more than 900 companies. The program helps companies with access to capital, capacity-building, coaching, networking and access to contracts. \"What we see is a lot of businesses that were started by someone because they knew how to do something - how to bake, how to sell books or make clothing, and they decided they were going to put out a shingle,\" Portillo Mazal says. \"They employ themselves and family members. Now they're at the point where they employ 10 or 12 people and they're saying, 'This is the first time I've had to think about how I position this as a business.'\" Helping those businesses to grow aligns with ICIC's goal of narrowing the racial wealth gap. \"How do you do that?\" Grossman says. \"For us it's creating viable, sustainable, healthy small business ecosystems.\" At the organization's annual conference, businesses are able to network with each other, opening up opportunities for them to make sales across the country. \"They can do business anywhere,\" Grossman says. \"If you're a bakery, and you've got a product you think you can sell online, somebody's got to teach you how to do that - how to use social media to market your product.\" ICIC relies on referrals to enroll companies in its program, using groups such as the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts. Grossman has also leaned on local luminaries, including District 7 City Councilor Kim Janey. Janey nominated 10 businesses last year, including Frugal Bookstore in Dudley Square. Participants in Inner City Capital Connections are given what Grossman calls a \"mini-MBA on steroids\" through 40 hours of coaching, during which the business owners are given access to experts in a range of areas. The entrepreneurs attend an opening full-day seminar with classes led by business school professionals. Throughout the program and after, they can access webinars geared toward helping them surmount business challenges. Participants also receive one-on-one coaching. The program ends with the national conference, where participants can hone their pitches for capital. They're also able to network with other businesses from the 14 cities in the program. \"Once they graduate, they become part of the Inner City Alumni Network, which is all about continuing education and networking,\" Grossman said. Demonstrated success Through all of its programming, ICIC has trained 2,221 businesses since 2005. Those businesses have seen an average revenue growth of 160 percent and collectively raised $1.29 billion in capital. Members of the Boston cohort of the Inner City Capital Connections program, which includes other eastern Massachusetts cities such as Worcester and Lowell, have created 1,500 new jobs and raised more than $45 million in capital, Grossman says. Over the last 25 years, he notes, banks have become more willing to loan to small businesses. Social impact investors - investors looking to support businesses that promote social good with modest returns on their investment - and crowdfunding also have served to increase access to capital for local businesses. \"Lenders are more confident that inner city lending or investing can earn a profit, a return on the investment,\" Grossman says. \"And that's a big change from when we started this project.\" Pushing for procurement Other initiatives ICIC is advancing include a push to get large institutions located in cities to contract with minority-owned businesses. Dubbed \"anchor institutions\" by Porter, hospitals, universities and other large employers can create more jobs in local communities by extending contracts to minority- and woman-owned firms. \"For every $1 million of procurement locally, it creates six to eight jobs,\" Grossman says. \"It's hard to get anchor institutions to change their purchasing habits because they have a lot of national contracts. They think it's more expensive to deal locally, you have to use more suppliers, and many of these companies have shrunk their procurement departments down, so it creates more work for them.\" But, Grossman argues, the societal benefits are worth the extra work. \"The benefits far outweigh whatever extra costs or expense in what would be involved in purchasing from local companies,\" he says. Grossman says ICIC's victories so far show that narrowing the racial wealth gap is possible. \"We've got a long way to go,\" he says. \"Narrowing the racial wealth gap, dealing with the challenges of businesses in under-resourced communities - this is a long-term set of challenges. But the growth, the quality jobs, the access to capital, at least demonstrate to us that we're on the right track. And we're hoping that as we grow in impact and the alumni network continues to relate to each other - that kind of connectedness breaks down barriers.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT On Monday, Aug. 12, Cohen premiered the film in conjunction with Hyde Square Task Force at the Connolly Branch of the Boston Public Library. Following the screening, Cohen spoke on a panel with other influential Latina voices in the community. Though \"Boston's Latin Quarter\" has served as a powerful tool to advocate for the neighborhood, it also illustrates the importance of having a cultural space. \"When you're in a country for generations, slowly you start to lose a lot of your home country,\" says Celina Miranda, executive director of Hyde Square Task Force. \"So having a place where you can go and immerse your children in the practices, the culture, is so important to stay connected.\" In the film, Cohen included interviews with Miranda and with Damaris Pimentel, the longtime owner of Ultra Beauty Salon, among many others. Both Miranda and Pimentel spoke on the panel at the library screening, along with local resident Elaine Mondy. Pimentel revealed that she had been advised early on to speak English in her salon. She refused. \"I want everyone to know who crosses the border to the salon, that this is a Latino salon,\" she says. Thirty years later, the business model is still thriving for this Latina entrepreneur. Though the film is definitively celebratory, it does touch on the complicated issues of gentrification and how the neighborhood is attempting to navigate newcomers while retaining the unique culture of their space. In September, \"Boston's Latin Quarter\" will be screened at City Hall for Latinx Heritage Month. Viewers can also see short films with interviews of local luminaries (also by Cohen) on the Hyde Square Task Force Facebook page. Cohen says her film can be screened anywhere, and she encourages community organizations to reach out if they're interested in showing it. She and Hyde Square Task Force are also hoping to make an audio guide for the neighborhood that visitors can listen to as they walk through the dynamic community. \"I felt compelled to tell the story because people needed to know the amount of effort the residents and activists and business owners in this area have put in to make this neighborhood what it is,\" says Cohen. \"I can eat the food that I love, I can speak in Spanish, and I can find a little bit of me in America.\" ON THE WEB About the film: www.theboomhouseproductions.com/news Hyde Square Task Force: www.hydesquare.org \"I felt compelled to tell the story because people needed to know the amount of effort the residents and activists and business owners in this area have put in to make this neighborhood what it is.

WOW! committee member Lisa Drexhage. \"This neighborhood is where POW! WOW! thought we could do the most good.\" A number of artists worked directly on the walls of the apartment buildings, creating relationships with the neighborhood kids while they worked. Dominican-American artist Tony Peralta created his first-ever mural in collaboration with Dominican artist Evaristo Angurria. Both artists depict women in curlers, Angurria as homage to his mother who owned a beauty salon and the other strong women in his life, and Peralta as a way to highlight famous Latinas throughout history. \"The majority of people in this community are Latin American,\" says Peralta. \"It's very important for kids to see artists of color working on it. It's important to see representation. If I was 5, 6, 7 years old living here, I would be blown away.\" The artists bonded with the area kids, chatting with them about art and answering their questions. Peralta even spray-painted their shoes for a custom look. The work of the two artists blends seamlessly on the wall, their similar styles rooted in Dominican culture and celebration. \"It's a representation of how we look at ourselves as Latin - the composition, the colors,\" says Angurria. Peralta typically works in silkscreen for his clothing company, the Peralta Project, and paints his famous Latinas on canvas. Angurria is known for his colorful, large-scale murals, which can be seen in Elm Park in Worcester as well as in Lynn and Somerville. Peralta says it was a steep learning curve transferring his work from the canvas to the wall, but with Angurria's help, he mastered the spray can. \"It's almost like a workshop,\" he says. In addition to the new location, this year's festival featured live artmaking by illustrators who projected their work onto walls and existing murals around the city for the public to observe. These were part of a large calendar of events and public programming geared towards engaging a diverse spectrum of communities. POW! WOW! Worcester had already created 116 new pieces of public art for the city prior to this year's festival. Now there are even more vibrant works to see throughout the community. Most of the murals are permanent, and the artists hope they will continue to have an impact on new immigrants and young people for years to come. Peralta says, \"When they step outside, they're going to see something familiar.\" ON THE WEB Find the murals on POW!WOW! Worcester's art map: www.powwowworcester.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Created by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, the 75-minute production features the six wives of Henry VIII as a pop girl band, and they've got a story to tell. As each queen sings her story and reclaims her personhood, it becomes clear just how badly history wronged these ladies. Each wife is modeled after a contemporary songstress in both style and aesthetic. Anna of Cleves, played to perfection in this production by Brittney Mack, channels Nicki Minaj and Rihanna. Catherine of Aragon, played by Adrianna Hicks, brings Beyonce and Shakira to the mix. The score perfectly blends the beats of contemporary music with raw history and poignant cultural analysis. Featuring lines like \"Okay ladies, let's get in reformation,\" and \"Everybody chill, it's totes God's will,\" it's every high school teacher's dream lesson: fun, relatable and perspective changing. \"SIX\" may have similar contemporary twists and rap verses to \"Hamilton\" but it features a population that got cheated in Lin Manuel Miranda's masterpiece: the ladies. In an interview with A.R.T. Marlow and Moss say they created the show because they knew so many talented female performers with limited opportunities. \"One component was about writing great parts for women,\" says Moss. \"Another was to highlight the parallels we saw between the Queens' experiences and those of women today.\" This is doubly impactful because the majority of the cast is women of color, another group notoriously excluded from and abused by history. Not only are audiences seeing a new perspective on women who are only known for their famous marriages, they're hearing these stories from populations that were excluded from the English historical narrative altogether. The show launched at Edinburg Fringe and then toured the U.K., premiering in London's West End and hopping the pond to enjoy a successful run at Chicago Shakespeare Theater. After a visit to the Sydney Opera House this coming January, the next stop for the show is the glittery lights of Broadway where it will debut in February 2020. Though additional performances were recently added to the A.R.T. run, New England theater lovers are as desperate for an audience with the Queens as Henry VIII was to summon the executioner. If you want to participate in the ultimate theatrical ex shaming, it's best to act fast. CREATED BY TOBY MARLOW AND LUCY MOSS, THE 75-MINUTE PRODUCTION FEATURES THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII AS A POP gIRL BAND, AND THEY'VE gOT A STORY TO TELL.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Urtubey manages and oversees the distribution for more than $3 million in small business resources under the Community Development Block Grant Program and more than $3 million in investment in small businesses within and outside of the 20 Main Streets districts. She directs and implements Mayor Martin Walsh's 2016 Small Business Plan to provide coordinated service delivery and economic opportunity for Boston's 40,000 small businesses. The Banner recently conducted an email Q-and-A with Urtubey. What's the importance of small businesses in Boston's economy? Small businesses are the heartbeat of Boston and contribute to the vibrancy and unique qualities of our neighborhoods. With more than 40,000 small businesses and $15 billion in revenue, these businesses represent more than 44 percent of employment and 37 percent of revenue for the city's private, for-profit businesses. What do you think are the greatest challenges facing small businesses in Boston? Many of our small businesses owned by women and people of color have struggled with access to capital and professional expertise. Through the Economic Development Center, we have rolled out a number of series to focus on immigrant and women business owners, as well as different industries, all of which include information on our neighborhood access business loans, technical assistance and design services, as well as local partners and resources. We have a lot of resources available for our small businesses, and I encourage anyone interested in learning more to visit www.boston.gov/departments/ small-business-development. What does your office hope to achieve with the citywide Small Business Plan? Since 2016, the Small Business Plan has served as the foundation for the Walsh administration's small business development strategy. This plan has informed our priorities of enhancing the ability of minority, immigrant and women entrepreneurs to successfully start and grow small businesses, and has guided in developing tools and policies to address specific gaps in key industries vital to Boston's economic growth. Boston's Main Streets program is 26 years old. How has it helped the city's business districts? As the first and largest urban Main Street program in the nation, Boston Main Streets (BMS) has shaped the identity of our city's neighborhood commercial districts. BMS helps build community, shape neighborhood voice, and enhance the access of businesses to resources. Just last month, we hosted our 'Mayor on Main' trolley tour, where Mayor Walsh together with city leadership and residents presented the 23rd Annual Boston Main Streets Awards, recognizing an outstanding business owner and volunteer from each district. As part of that tour, Mayor Walsh shared the exciting news that in 2021, the National Main Streets Conference will come to Boston. Some business owners say rising rents may soon force them out of their locations. What is the city doing to help businesses with the challenges of displacement? Long-term commercial vacancies and preventing displacement is a top priority for our team and we are actively working on ways we can further support our local businesses in the locations they love. One way we're helping small businesses prevent displacement is by providing technical assistance for legal assistance in cases of displacement or lease negotiations. What have you learned about Boston's small businesses since you took on this role in October 2018 ? I have learned a ton about our city's business ecosystem and the incredible amount of support that exists for local small businesses. I have learned that businesses come in all shapes and sizes, and that we as a City can help businesses thrive through business education, technical support, grants, and simply one-on-one case management. Finally, I have been more aware of how important it is to shop local. Even though I am a Dorchester resident, I pride myself on exploring every neighborhood and visiting small, local businesses throughout the city of Boston.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Walsh is charging the newly created commission to pay special attention to the needs of Boston's immigrant communities. Both state and federal law provide legal protections and mandate that certain basic services be provided to all people, regardless of their immigration status. The Human Rights Commission is a seven-member body appointed by the Mayor, which was originally created to receive and investigate complaints regarding discrimination relating to the workplace, housing, credit, education, public accommodations and other areas. The commission has the power to conduct hearings and call witnesses, and can issue reports and the results of investigations. The commission also has the power to adopt rules and regulations and recommend legislation to the City Council and the mayor. \"I'm honored to be chosen by Mayor Walsh to lead the Human Rights Commission,\" said Carvalho.\" At this time in our country, I'm proud Boston has doubled down on our commitment to protect and advance the rights of all people.\" Born in Cabo Verde, Carvalho emigrated to Dorchester at the age of 15. A graduate of Boston Public Schools, Carvalho graduated at the top of his class at Madison Park High, and went to earn degrees from UMass Amherst and Howard University School of Law. Carvalho began his legal career doing high level internal investigations of large companies and complex litigations at the law firm WilmerHale. Later, as an assistant district attorney prosecuting gun crimes in Boston, he saw firsthand the cycles of poverty and violence that put young men and women in the Criminal Justice System. Most recently, Carvalho represented the Suffolk 5th District in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He, his wife Ashley, and their daughter Eliana currently live in Dorchester.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT 2. Announce a pause in the rush for dollars and fresh supporters for one day on Tuesday, Sept. 17 - the federally-recognized Constitution and Citizenship Day - to salute grassroots democracy. In accordance with the DNC guidelines for candidates seeking to participate in the first two debates, a remarkable 21 candidates apparently resonated enough with disparate slices of the electorate to register at least 1 percent in four important polls and to earn donations from at least 65,000 voters. Cumulatively, nearly 3.5 million donors have invested over $220 million so far, a historic sum at this stage of the presidential primary process. To build this required popularity, several candidates introduced novel policy solutions and urgent perspectives. Take, for example, entrepreneur Andrew Yang's guaranteed monthly income plan to combat job loss stemming from automation, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax plan to reduce income inequality and Gov. Jay In-slee's environmental wake-up call that \"We are the first generation to feel the sting of the climate crisis, and the last generation that can do something about it.\" The DNC's escalating criteria for the September debate - 130,000 donors and 2 percent in four important polls - has demanded even more ingenuity from candidates. By taking a respite on Constitution and Citizenship Day, the campaigns can reward voters, avert burnout and reclaim patriotism. 3. Take an occupational approach to staying in the race. Clearly, the DNC's debate criteria alone do not fully answer the question of how to cull the field organically. The candidates should help accelerate the process by voluntarily embracing and abiding by an \"occupational ranking\" via the above polling and donor data. In essence, each should ponder, where does he/ she rank in comparison to the other mayors, senators or governors in the race? Using this metric, a candidate should place no worse than third in his \"occupational lane\" to advance into September. Furthermore, we can apply an exclusionary rule that says U.S. representatives usually should not run for president because as members of a 435-seat body, they lack a broad constituency. Unlike mayors, they do not wield executive authority over a city. Conversely, we should create a lane to recognize the top outsider. Notably, Sen. Cory Booker cites his two terms as Newark mayor frequently enough to warrant dual status. Under this occupational-lane approach, the field shrinks to nine, ranked as follows: Outsider: Yang Mayor: 1-Buttigieg, 2-Booker, 3-Castro Senator: 1-Warren, 2-Sanders, 3-Harris Governor: Bullock Vice President: Biden The utility of this lens is in how it would provide accomplished, talented but stalled candidates like Sens. Michael Bennet and Amy Klobuchar and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke with a dignified rationale for withdrawing. 4. Those staying in the race should double-check their stump speeches for accuracy. When the DNC declined to establish any institutional mechanism for fact-checking the truthfulness and accuracy of what the candidates say during the debates, it delegated this duty. But in the debates, the formats and questions asked conspired to strengthen market forces that reward personal and policy storytelling that reshapes reality. Currently, several campaigns are saddled with grenades that could detonate spontaneously when public scrutiny intensifies this fall or in the general election. Fortunately, a solution exists: The surviving candidates can retell their personal and policy stories more expansively beginning this fall. 5. Every candidate should issue a written pledge to raise funds and campaign for the future nominee until Election Day ends on Nov. 3, 2020. Critically, as the field contracts, the donors of the defeated must stay invested, and their disappointed canvassers can't sleep. For the climactic battle sequence unfolding in September through November of next year, the Democratic Avengers must swarm the electoral map so the nominee can deliver a fatal blow to Donald Trump's reelection machine.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Initially, Noah Hicks, community activist and founder of Bow-doin Bike School, partnered with Rai and HBI on plans to open Sip and Spoke Bike Kitchen, a bike repair shop and cafe, in the former comfort station. Renovations, which have to cost around $1.4 million, according to HBI, began in early 2019, but the bike cafe plans did not work out. Hicks transferred control of the project to Rai, whose extensive restaurant experience includes co-founding Roxbury's Dudley Cafe, and Perry to ensure the development of a community-centric commercial establishment. Hicks is confident the pair is capable of building such a space, he tells the Banner. \"I think it is most meaningful for this community to have a gathering space and a community cafe,\" says Hicks. \"That was what excited people about our idea. I love the fact that that's still going to happen, and I think they are wonderful people to pull it off.\" A community focus Like Hicks, Rai and Perry have made community development a central goal for the Comfort Kitchen project. Perry, who founded Yin Consulting, is using her background in organizational consulting to gather data about the community's wants. She uses hu-man-centered-design interviews, a process of collecting information by focusing mainly upon the perspectives of community members. She then takes the data and works to turn community desires into reality. Perry and Rai plan to publish a synthesis of the community interviews later this month. For now, both say the data they've gathered has helped them to explore various pathways for the restaurant's success. \"We want to be in touch with our surroundings,\" Rai says, \"because we find that community needs are here on the left, and then somebody comes in and builds something that is totally way out there [on the right]. And then, that person doesn't do well because they are not meeting the community's needs.\" To distinguish Comfort Kitchen from other restaurants in Uphams Corner and the Greater Boston area, Perry and Rai intend to focus on three elements. First, the pair wants to provide meaningful and educational experiences during meals. For instance, Rai says the restaurant could infuse lessons about the farm-to-table process into meals to inform consumers about challenges in the restaurant industry. Second, they strive to turn the restaurant into a social and comfortable community gathering place. Lastly, in building a community at the restaurant, the couple wants to connect people from different backgrounds to generate cross-cultural understanding within the community. As an example of an issue in need of a space for open-community dialogue, Perry cites gentrification. \"It is very important that we create a space where we can start to build that cross-cultural understanding and to share the stories and legacy and history of the space,\" Perry says. \"But also so new people who come in can start to acknowledge what's going on around them and be present to [the fact that] there is a legacy here, there is a history here that needs to be acknowledged. And I think that's a part of the cultural clash that is happening here.\" Immigrant roots Though they highlight gentrification as an existing tension in the neighborhood, they also explain that Dorchester already has a diverse and trusting community. Rai, who immigrated from Nepal to the United States at the age of 18, talks about how neither Nepal nor America accepted him as a native son. Perry counters that Dorchester has accepted Rai into the community, and his struggle to find a home factored into their business model. \"Well, he has no home, so where is his place in this world?\" asks Perry. \"I feel like Dorchester is a place where he is able to build that and to have those relationships. Everybody deserves to feel at home and to feel a sense of comfort. So that's part of what we are trying to build.\" To produce that sense of comfort at the new restaurant, the couple has invested in a core menu with Ghanaian and Nepali roots. They have partnered with Kwasi Kwaa, an immigrant from Ghana and the owner of Chop Bar, a Ghanaian street-food popup. Comfort Kitchen's menu also will offer American versions of comfort food, such as breakfast sandwiches. Mentorship for chefs For roughly four months, the restaurant will let other local chefs put their food on the menu for half the week. The couple says chefs often struggle to transition into restaurant ownership because many lack experience in financing a restaurant and managing employees. So they hope to mentor other local chefs, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, through these pop-up nights. Before Comfort Kitchen's opening, expected in May of 2020, HBI has required that the couple reach several fundraising goals. They admit that it will be tough, but say they are committed to success and to the community. \"We want to have 10 solid employees that are paid well and very invested in the community for the long term,\" Rai says. \"That way, we can provide a high level of customer service and quality of food, and also be in the community for a long time. And about our commitment to Uphams Corner - we are not coming in there to open a restaurant for like five years. This is a long-term commitment, because it is our life-long journey. This is our life.\" It is very important that we create a space where we can start to build that cross-cultural understanding and to share the stories and legacy and history of the space.\" - Nyacko Perry",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The Makerspace Training, Collaboration and Hiring (MaTCH) Pilot Competition, recently launched by the SBA, provides funding to expand programs with job-specific and soft-skills training within existing makerspaces. Makerspaces are uniquely positioned to help increase workforce development across the country. These spaces are open to people focused on obtaining new skills, including current and aspiring entrepreneurs. Many of these spaces offer a variety of tools, such as 3D printers, laser cutters, woodworking machines, soldering irons and sewing machines. Many makerspaces are open and operating across our region. The MaTCH competition led to 12 grants in the following tiers: * Seed: Up to $25,000 to seed small workforce development programs. * Proof of Principle: Up to $100,000 to grow programs with a proven history of training and/ or workforce development. * Scale: Up to $200,000 for capacity building of successful existing programs with a strong history of training and/or workforce development. This winner would also have graduated participants in at least two training cycles. On Aug. 20, I was excited to learn that The Clubhouse Network, with a makerspace in the heart of Boston, has been awarded a Scale grant of $100,000. The Clubhouse at 2107 Washington St. in Roxbury is a makerspace that promotes community, peer-to-peer support, and inclusion. It is part of the Clubhouse Network, which operates clubhouses around the world but was founded and is based in the Boston area. The Roxbury Clubhouse is its flagship site. Previously an artist studio, inventor's workshop, design house, film sound stage and backlot, hackerspace, music studio, and video game development lab, the Roxbury Clubhouse provides a safe, creative learning environment for teens to explore their own ideas, develop skills, and build confidence in themselves through the use of technology. With the award from the SBA MaTCH pilot competition, The Clubhouse Network will expand its Clubhouse-to-Career (C2C) Pathways to Success program for young adults. Participants will each be awarded a stipend upon completion of the program as an incentive, as compensation for time spent and to recognize the work accomplished. The C2C program has a goal of immediate placement into a meaningful paid job. When announcing the awardees, SBA Acting Administrator Chris Pilkerton noted, \"The MaTCH competition is a testament to the SBA's commitment to identifying employment opportunities and supporting small business' workforce recruitment and retention. Makerspaces are uniquely positioned to help innovate training for the workforces of today and tomorrow.\" Robert H. Nelson is Massachusetts district director of the U.S. Small Business Administration. \"The MaTCH competition is a testament to the SBA's commitment to identifying employment opportunities and supporting small business' workforce recruitment and retention.\" -Chris Pilkerton, SBA Acting Administrator ON THE WEB SBA MaTCH competition: www.sba.gov/match#main-content The Clubhouse in Roxbury: flagshipclubhouse.org",

      "body": "FULL TEXT One likely role for student apprentices is information technology data analyst. \"Essentially, this is a person who has analytic skills,\" Francis says. \"They collect information specific to whatever business they're working in and use analytics software to solve a business problem.\" In Massachusetts, 10 percent of the labor force works in technology and 23 percent of all job postings in the state are in tech-related applications, according to Francis. Francis says she expects that the students trained through the program will be able to move up the career ladder at the tech firms they're placed in - and can expect decent pay. \"These are family-sustaining wages,\" she says. \"These are the types of jobs that put people into the middle class.\" Apprenti is operating in Massachusetts through a U.S. Department of Labor contract, with support from the Boston-based One8 Foundation. Since its inception in Massachusetts last year, Apprenti has established programs across industries, securing partnerships with top employers such as Wayfair, Carbon Black, Cengage, Harvard University Information Technology and PTC computer software and services company. Additionally, Apprenti works closely with industry organizations statewide, including the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, the Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council and the Massachusetts Workforce Skills Cabinet, to support economic growth efforts throughout the commonwealth. Lauren Jones, Massachusetts director for Apprenti, is enthusiastic about the new partnership with BFIT as a training provider, which she hopes will help expand the apprenticeship model as a tech career steppingstone as well as contribute to the state's economic strength. \"Together, we are delivering the technical instruction to advance adoption of registered apprenticeship throughout the commonwealth - and meeting the tech talent needs of leading Massachusetts employers,\" she says. Longstanding institution BFIT was founded in 1908 and works to provide technical career paths to Greater Boston young people while keeping costs and time commitment to a minimum and ensuring that the instruction is geared toward real industry needs. \"Our mission is to make sure the students we're training are going into fields where there is high demand,\" Francis says. BFIT offers certificate programs in fields including automotive management, biomedical engineering technology, computer technology, construction management, electronics engineering technology and medical engineering technology. Francis says all of the school's programs place an emphasis on management. The school's most recent job placement figure is 93 percent. Over a five-year span, 85 percent of graduates were working full-time in the fields for which they were trained. \"The majority of our training is middle-skills training for jobs that do not require a four-year degree,\" Francis says. \"There are evolving needs in the high-tech field for workers, and we're meeting those needs.\" Apprenti and BFIT are providing relief for employers struggling to fill middle-skills tech jobs, specifically in IT business analytics, as well as giving folks in our underserved communities a chance at economic empowerment.\" - Aisha Francis, BFIT chief of staff",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Through Oct. 12, SpeakEasy Stage Company presents the New England premiere of the musical coming-of-age story \"Choir Boy,\" in the Roberts Studio Theatre at the Boston Center for the Arts in Boston's South End. The Broadway production of \"Choir Boy\" won 2019 Tony and Drama Desk awards for Best Sound Design and Outstanding Music, respectively. The story unfolds through gospel, spiritual and R&B music as well as the drill-like propulsion of step, a movement tradition devised by South African miners, adopted by Historically Black Colleges & Universities and popularized by Step Afrika! and Stomp productions. Its musical repertoire includes \"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\" and \"Motherless Chile\" as well as less familiar spirituals, performed with power and skill both in a percussive tempo and in classical a capella renderings by eight young actors - Isaiah Reynolds as Pharus, Jaimar Brown as his roommate Anthony, along with Antione Gray, Dwayne P. Mitchell, Malik Mitchell, Aaron Patterson, Thomas Purvis and Nigel Richards. Drawing on African American traditions of church, music and movement, the staging also adds, unnecessarily, occasional overlays of recordings by such icons as Martin Luther King, James Baldwin and Langston Hughes. The eight young performers drive the show, both in their charged interactions and in their ensemble performances. The production showcases the bench strength of performing arts talent here in Boston. Director Maurice Emmanuel Parent is an accomplished actor and also co-founder and executive director of Front Porch Arts Collective, a new black-led theater company committed to advancing racial equity in Boston through theater. The show's musical director, David Freeman Coleman, is choral director at the Dana Hall School, a director of the Millennium Gospel Choir and director of the 225-voice Third Day Gospel Choir at Tufts University. Choreographers are Yewande Odetoyinbo and Ruka White, on the faculty of Boston Conservatory at Berklee, where Odetoyinbo earned an MFA. The first-rate staging makes the most of parallels between the drill-like musical formations and the rigid daily rules of the school, such as scheduled five-minute intervals to call home. A terrific set by Baron Pugh echoes the shifting grid formations of the choreography with its centerpiece, a cross, the traditional ethical symbol associated with a Christian prep school. Sensitive lighting by Oliver Wason enables actors to express without words fraught inner states and vulnerability not shown in their behavior. Boston Arts Academy graduate Malik Mitchell excels as the sullen Bobby, a puzzling character who is vindictive without apparent cause and a privileged nephew of the headmaster. His face becomes a portrait of pain as he sings \"Motherless Chile.\" Rounding out the 10-member cast are J. Jerome Rogers and Richard Snee, who portray two odd grown-ups. As Headmaster Marrow, Rogers is uncommitted in his performance of a figure with no palpable authority. Equally unconvincing is Snee as a white humanities scholar drafted to engage the chorus in conflict resolution. SpeakEasy's excellent program booklet includes an essay by Coleman, \"On the Negro Spiritual,\" and an interview by dramaturg Rosalind Bevan with playwright Tarell Alvin Mc-Craney, recipient of a MacArthur \"Genius\" Grant. Reflecting on his own Pharus-like youth, McCraney says, \"I was growing up black and queer in the South, and looking to be part of a community... I still remember going to high school and how terrifying it was to try to be open and myself and excel in all the ways I wanted to excel.\" Boston Conservatory graduate Isaiah Reynolds plays Pharus, who has a lot to lose, including his scholarship, but mostly, a sense of his place in the world. Physically smaller than the other boys, his Pharus expresses his pent-up aggression by challenging chorus mates and teachers on matters of principle or tradition, arguing, for example, that spirituals were not in fact coded guides for escaped slaves. Early in the run, he plays Pharus as mannered, preening and pouting, not yet a character that elicits audience empathy. Pharus only lets down his guard with his roommate, the athletic and good-natured Anthony, rendered with compelling naturalness by Jaimar Brown. Anthony, played persuasively by Brown, guides Pharus into a rapport that grows from curiosity to mutual respect and on to understanding, compassion and a first experience of friendship.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Expanding the definition of what jazz is and isn't, on Sept. 27, at 8 and 10 p.m. is The Midnight Hour, started in 2018 by Ali Shaheed Muhammad of A Tribe Called Quest and producer/ composer Adrian Younge. At Scullers, they will be joined by Angela Munoz, Jack Waterson and Lauren Oden. Best known for writing the score for Marvel's \"Luke Cage\" on Netflix, The Midnight Hour takes hip-hop, R&B and jazz, mixes things up and creates new sounds. Come prepared to move, as Scullers announces, \"For this special show, please note the main floor of the club will be standing room only unless you purchase dinner and show packages, which come with reserved seats.\" Continuing with a wide-open approach to what music can be about, Grammy Award-winning singer Macy Gray will take over the club for three nights, Oct. 17 through 19, at 8 and 10 p.m. Using her smoky voice to reinterpret rock and R&B classics until they become as associated with her versions as the originals, Gray has a knack for making listeners rethink where jazz can go in terms of musical exploration. It's a rare opportunity to hear a great performer in a small club setting. And for those with deep pockets and an ability to stay up late, there's a \"meet and greet with Macy\" each night at 11:30 p.m., purchased separately for $100 per person. On Oct. 25 and 26, The Bad Plus plays at 8 and 10 p.m. This idiosyncratic trio out of Minneapolis will treat people's ears to a blend of sounds that is theirs alone. What does this mean? Bassist Reid Anderson, pianist Orrin Evans and drummer Dave King recorded \"Blunt Object Live in Tokyo,\" and on the same CD did their take of Queen's \"We Are the Champions\" and the jazz standard \"My Funny Valentine.\" It's not a mash-up, it's precise and a little bit intellectual, but always fearless. Finally, on this road of taking jazz in new directions, there's Robert Glasper. On Dec. 13 and 14 at 8 and 10 p.m., Glasper arrives with his trio that uses synthe-siz-ers as well as traditional instruments, in ways many will find surprising and exciting. Having worked with Mos Def and Ken-drick Lamar, he creates music that's hard to define. If Thelonious Monk and George Clinton were in one man, that man might be Robert Glasper. Back to the jazz tradition For those who enjoy music more evidently part of the great jazz tradition, too, Scullers has an array of musicians not to be missed. Trumpeter Wallace Roney will be in town for one show only on Sept. 28 at 8 p.m. With a sound indebted to Miles Davis, Roney's music has extraordinary depth. He has an ability to establish a romantic mood with just a few spare, long notes. On Nov. 8 and 9 at 8 and 10 p.m., Cuban-American Arturo Sandoval takes to the stage with his trumpet. Defecting from Cuba in 1990 while touring with his mentor Dizzy Gillespie, Sandoval has won 10 Grammy awards. Sandoval is impossible to categorize, always open to new sounds and ways of creating music, yet sticking close to what's classic. On \"Ultimate Duets,\" his 2018 CD, he collaborated with Pharrell Williams, Ariana Grande and Stevie Wonder. And what better way to spend the weekend after Thanksgiving than by going to hear pianist Eddie Palmieri? Still going strong as he enters his 83rd year, Palmieri will be at Scullers at 8 and 10 p.m. on Nov. 29 and 30. For those still in school, more good news: With a valid student ID, Scullers offers a 50% reduction on ticket prices at the door (depending on availability). It's quite a line-up this fall, thanks to Jan Mullen, artistic director and general manager of Scullers, who is bringing jazz forward while respecting the traditions that inspire new talent.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Like most Roxbury Latin boys, Richard's passions are not singular. He is a student; he is an athlete; and he is a performer. He holds these three aspects of himself in proper balance, recognizing that they together work to comprise the fullness of his interests. Challenges overcome in the classroom work in tandem with challenges overcome on the wrestling mat, and it is through the accumulation of these small tests that Richard has forged his identity and fashioned himself into the confident young man who now, along with his 51 classmates, helps to lead the student body. During his time at the school, Richard has taken part in countless curricular and extracurricular endeavors. He cites his junior year Computer Science course as one that tested him particularly. \"My strength has always been in working with numbers. Languages have challenged me more. Computer Science is a course that asks you to bring numbers together with language. It was a challenging class that opened my eyes to the duality of those concepts within coding.\" Richard is a committed wrestler who has been a part of the program since his first winter season as a seventh grader. After five years of playing soccer, he has decided in his senior fall to try football for the first time. Richard has played lacrosse while here, and tennis, and is even contemplating trying track and field this spring. He has sung in the school's choral program each of his years at RL and for his final three years as a member of the school's selective a cappella group, the Latonics. He has been on Roxbury Latin's stage for two plays and one musical, so far, with more productions in his future. He has traveled with the school to Quebec, WashingtonD.C., and Los Angeles. He has spent a month in France as part of RL's language immersion program, and this spring he will travel to the Czech Republic with his peers. He is committed to his passions while unafraid of trying something entirely new, even late in his high school years. He has been, as we want all our boys to be, open to new opportunity-and opportunities abound at Roxbury Latin. Richard and his RL school-mates benefit from supportive teachers and coaches who care to go beyond the requisite attention to their classes and activities. The school's advising system ensures that each boy will be cared for as an individual, whose six- or four-year journey through the school will result not merely in his growth as a student and athlete and artist, but will-and must-result in his growth as a person of character and of unflinching integrity. The school cares most of all what kind of person a boy is. As a community, Roxbury Latin places great importance on civility, cooperation, and respect, and it reinforces these behaviors always. The students who comprise the school are bright and talented as individuals, but their precociousness gives way to humility as they recognize that power lies in their collected assembly and not in their individual exploits. \"I really like my classmates, in particular,\" says Richard. \"We are close, and the guys who came to RL in ninth grade meshed really well. We've been through a lot together and have depended on one another.\" A small school of304 boys, Roxbury Latin is located in West Roxbury. Easily accessible from all parts of the City of Boston, the school is proud to serve the community it has been a part of since its founding in 1645. Richard Impert, a shining example of one whose commitment is broad and whose spirit is generous, is one of many similarly bright and engaged students who together make up the Roxbury Latin student body. As an independent, all-boys' day school, Roxbury Latin is a distinctive community comprised of boys from various backgrounds contributing various talents. Through its need-blind admission process, the school seeks ambitious young men who endeavor to realize their potential and aspire to do something good with their lives.

And all powered by community folks. It's beautiful.\" Jo-M\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9 Dance Company was one of the many groups to perform throughout the day. The company runs a professional dance group and also focuses on enriching the lives of young people through dance programs. The professional company performed a new modern piece about belonging, choreographed by Jo-M\u00e2\u201d\u0153\u00d0\u00b9 Co-founder and Executive Artistic Director Joe Gonzalez. He says he thought the theme would be appropriate for a new space where Roxbury residents belong. \"In a lot of communities I notice that there are not a lot of place for dancers to go. To have somewhere in Boston to rehearse and perform and show our work to the community is wonderful,\" says Gonzalez. In addition to the many performances and participatory activities, Be the Artists hosted a \"Roxbury's Got Talent\" event allowing community members to perform on stage and compete for prizes. All the contestants live in Roxbury or have a significant connection to the community. The Guild has created this urban park space as a taste of what will come to the Bartlett Station compound after construction is finished. In the meantime, this temporary park will have programming provided by The Guild through November and then again in the spring and through the fall of 2020. What The Guild and Nuestra Comunidad have done is activate the pre-construction space. The programming and design of the park were both created by the community, utilizing community input. \"We're hoping to showcase the power and strength that's in our neighborhoods despite the disparities and injustices,\" says Senxian. \"We're strong and beautiful and powerful right here right now.\" \"We're hoping to showcase the power and strength that's in our neighborhoods despite the disparities and injustices.

      "body": "FULL TEXT They were not disappointed. \"#Truth\" follows Stewart Cooper, who reels in the wake of his cousin's suicide after she experiences social media shaming. When it's revealed that the affair she was being shamed for was with her church pastor, Cooper turns the tables on the man of God. In a contemporary moment when \"fake news\" and Internet bullying are ever-present concerns, #Truth delves into potent, sensitive plotlines. \"Nowadays we get information so quickly,\" says Nelson, who plays a detective investigating the suicide. \"This takes it to the worst place that it could go in terms of social media and the fallout. It's extremely tangible and extremely relatable.\" Nelson says he also was enthusiastic about the production for its portrayal of the black church as one with flaws and multitudes, rather than the caricature of gospel music and attitude that it's often reduced to. The Roxbury International Film Festival will be screening the film on Thursday, Oct. 10 at the Museum of Fine Arts. Nelson will be in attendance at the event for a Q&A with the audience after the screening. \"#Truth\" debuted in February of this year at the Pan-African Film and Arts Festival. Director and writer Charles Murray was given a 2017 Image Award by the NAACP for outstanding writing in a motion picture (television) and in 2013, won best screenplay at the American Black Film Festival. Beach won't be able to attend the Oct. 10 screening, but his hometown pride remains strong. \"I love the idea that films I'm a part of sometimes get to play specifically in Roxbury at RoxFilm because it's home. It's where I started,\" he says. \"Festivals like RoxFilm help facilitate people's hopes and dreams from places like Roxbury and Dorchester, and they need to be frequented and promoted.\" Nelson says that despite the very real problems depicted in the film, he hopes it allows viewers to escape into a fictional world for a short time. \"The two or so hours that I'm watching a film, I hope to be taken completely inside of it and register an experience,\" he says. \"That's what I hope people take away from it.\" ON THE WEB More information and tickets for the screening at www.mfa.org/event/film/truth",

      "body": "FULL TEXT These details are another crucial part of the program. Book club members are given information about how to book tickets, where to find parking in Boston's busy theater district and what to expect when seeing a show. This makes the theater experience increasingly accessible for viewers who haven't felt welcome or comfortable in those spaces before. The program was born from a desire to bring more diverse audiences into the theater, particularly from black communities. And in that way, it has been very effective; Abaka says the numbers of viewers of color attending the theater have grown. But the Book Club has also become a space where people of all backgrounds can have constructive and in-depth conversations about their experiences. On a small but mighty scale, it's breaking down the segregated nature of Boston's neighborhoods. Paula Elliot has been participating in the book clubs since their inception. Though she has been very involved in the art and music worlds, she didn't have much experience with theater when she came on board. \"I really had no exposure to theater for all practical purposes,\" she says. \"I never would've imagined that I would be this engaged for this long. I feel very strongly about this program.\" But Elliot didn't just come for the entertainment. One of the first plays the group read was \"The Trip to Bountiful,\" a play traditionally done with a white cast that at ArtsEmerson was done with an allblack cast featuring Cicely Tyson and Vanessa Williams. Elliot was one of the few white attendees at the Dudley Branch Book Club, and she says she valued learning about a new perspective from her fellow community members. She says, \"It made connections to questions that I had not really articulated earlier in life.\" Akaba says these cultural crossovers and conversations have been an important outcome of the program. \"What we found was that regardless of culture, socioeconomic background, regardless of the demographics of the participants, people came for the social connection and discussion, to hear the story, to see some semblance of their life reflected back to them.\" Registration is open now for book clubs discussing the upcoming shows \"Triptych (Eyes of One on Another)\" and \"An Iliad,\" to begin soon at locations in Roxbury, Downtown Boston and Allston. Registration for \"Detroit Red\" and \"Metamorphosis\" will be open in November.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Part of Praxis Stage's 2019-2020 Shakespeare season, \"Coriolanus\" is a complicated story, but co-director Daniel Boudreau explains, \"The particular plays we're choosing are about power and its consequences on people's lives, the crushers and the crush-ees.\" In the Praxis adaptation, the action takes place in the year 2049. Co-director Audrey Seraphin says this was a very specific choice. \"According to census data, that is the year the U.S. is poised to be a majority POC nation. White people will no longer be the majority,\" she says. \"We really intentionally cast it to reflect that. We feature a really diverse ensemble, but very intentionally cast all the patricians and the nobility in general as people of color.\" In this new futuristic setting, the implications of the play take on a contemporary context. For example, Seraphin suggests the grain shortage could be because of environmental burnout. The diversity of the production is what drew many of the cast members to the show and it shines a complicated light on the plot. What was historically a battle among white Roman-era factions is now a battle shaded with race. It's also been an opportunity to upend tradition. Thomika Bridwell plays Roman general Titus Lartius, but she plays him as a black woman. This brings a new dynamism to the character, alluding to decisions she has made to pursue a life in her calling in the military. Bridwell says, \"What I love is that we're able to see an array of women. Women are not just portrayed in one light. We're really showing that women have the choice to be whatever it is they imagine they can be.\" As is the mission of Praxis Stage, the show uproots theater from its typical location downtown and brings it into surrounding communities. Little House, at 275 East Cottage St. in Dorchester, is not only aesthetically stunning, but impactful for the community that has long seen it as a center of education and personal growth. Karimah Williams, who plays Valeria says, \"Coming in and seeing the diversity as far as color, as far as age, as far as experience, that is always really attractive, and to be a part of a community that reflects the world we live in and the world that I really, really want to make sure my kids come up in.\" Coming in and seeing the diversity as far as color, as far as age, as far as experience, that is always really attractive to be a part of a community that reflects the world we live in and the world that I really, really want to make sure my kids come up in.\" - Karimah Williams ON THE WEB Learn more and purchase tickets at: www.praxisstage.com",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The following interview with Bowie has been edited for brevity. What made you decide to start Msaada Partners? Bowie: In a sense it was \"Snowmageddon\" back in 2015. I was approaching my eighth year of working for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I was an associate commissioner at the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection working on brownfields, environmental justice and food policy. All three of those areas had stalled due to different issues - funding, staffing and scoping. The feud between Governor Charlie Baker and then-MBTA General Manager Beverly Scott had sucked the oxygen away from almost everything else, so I had some time on my hands to think about next steps. In traveling around the state to discuss environmental justice issues, I quickly realized that while mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gases or adapting to it through preparedness efforts was important to communities, it was not the most important issue. [More important were] jobs, education, housing, transportation, food insecurity and public safety, to name a few. As a person of color, a black man, I got it. As a public servant and environmental official, I did not think that jobs, for instance, and climate change action were mutually exclusive. I actually thought that it was terrible that communities were bearing the brunt of the \"environmental bads\" while missing out on the \"environmental goods,\" such as green and cleantech jobs in energy efficiency, renewable energy, water and open spaces. In parallel, I had been mentoring for the MIT Venture Mentoring Service (VMS) for four or five years by then and had recognized that I was not mentoring people who looked like me. They were typically white or Asian MIT students, and mostly men. One of those white guys was Gilad Rosenzweig, who started Smarter in the City, a high tech accelerator in Dudley Square. I was recruited to join Gilad's mentor team and help him to better understand white privilege and some of the pushback he was getting from some members of the community. I also was able to meet entrepreneurs like Mojossorica \"Rica\" Elysee and Melissa James of BeautyLynk and Tech Connection, respectively. Rica and Melissa are both young black women with great ideas for companies that they have grown since then; however, I could see the stark difference in the level of resources - time, talent and treasure - that these young black women in Dudley Square were receiving, vs. the young white men in Kendall Square. I incorporated Msaada Partners in June of 2015 and on Leap Year Day 2016 (i.e., February 29), took the leap of faith and started fulltime on Msaada Partners. What unique skills and perspectives do you and your partners bring to the startup world? We are competent in the startup space; we are taking a commercial approach; and we genuinely care about the communities we serve. None of these items is unique in and of themselves, but it is somewhat unique to have them all together. In terms of competency for example, in addition to serving as a mentor for MIT's Venture Mentoring Service (VMS) for the last nine years, I am also an adjunct instructor for the National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps Program. Thus, I am accustomed to working with early-stage startups on how to achieve product market fit, develop their go-to market strategies, and sustain and grow their operations. While a number of our clients are nonprofit organizations, our primary focus is on growth-focused entrepreneurs, startups and small businesses. Lastly, we care about the communities. So while we do not begrudge and even welcome more donor dollars coming into nonprofits in the community, we really want to see more investor dollars going to the businesses in the community. We are \"committed\" to the communities in much the same way a pig is committed to a plate of ham and eggs. There are a lot of organizations that are more \"involved,\" like a chicken is with the eggs. What do you see as the greatest challenges facing entrepreneurs in communities of color? What we've heard is that entrepreneurs of color need technical assistance that fits, access to capital, and space to collaborate and convene - especially in Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan. We think that entrepreneurs need the consulting, coaching and connections that we aim to provide. What are some key strategies you employ to help new companies grow? Generally, listening to the voice of the customer is the key strategy or tactic for helping companies grow. The biggest reason that most enterprises fail is because they provide something that nobody really wants. Helping clients to get out of the way and listen to and digest what their customers are telling them is a key strategy that we employ. This allows the company to really home in on who their customer truly is and what value, if any, they are truly providing. This is the essence of product market fit and the building block for everything else. More specifically, we select a half-dozen companies for our Majira Project that matches post-accelerator companies led by founders of color and/or targeting underserved communities with pro bono consultants from The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) who work on a strategy, sales and marketing, or operations project. Msaada Partners provides business coaching and mentoring in series and in parallel with the approximately 16-week BCG engagement. What qualities do you think are necessary for an entrepreneur to be successful in today's economy? Grit, humility, and passion. Paraphrasing Ecclesiastes 9:11, the race is neither won by the swift nor the strong but they who endureth to the end. This entrepreneurship thing is not a sprint, a steeplechase, or a marathon - it is all of the above. It is not for the faint of heart, so you need to be ready to deal with the ups and downs, long nights and all that goes with making your business successful. Grit requires patience and strength. You also need humility to be able to be able to recognize your limitations and seek out help when you need it. Lastly, you have to have passion for the problem that you are trying to solve - otherwise, there is no fuel for the grit, no compelling reason for you to humble yourself and ask for help. What do you enjoy most about working with entrepreneurs? My passion is efficiency. Working in the energy and environmental space was a great place to put this passion to work, as we do so many things in an inefficient way in terms of wasted resources. However, the entrepreneurship and innovation space is a great place too, as we are currently wasting resources there. There are companies that are not being formed because of the lack of capital coming into our communities, due to both conscious and unconscious biases past and present. Being able to match entrepreneurs with the appropriate resources and see them grow their businesses, hire employees and create wealth is why we do the work that we do.

      "body": "FULL TEXT On view through Oct. 20 at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is her beguiling installation, \"I Know Why They Left.\" The exhibit features 55 ink drawings inspired by the abundance of animal figures depicted in the art and furnishings of the museum, a Venetian palazzo that Isabella Stewart Gardner constructed at the turn of the century and filled with favorite objects span ning more than a millennium. Renderings of mythical, archetypal and natural animals are ubiquitous in the museum, in tapestries, furniture, paintings, decorative objects, and even at the base of pillars, which are supported by stoic lions. A collector of animal figures since childhood, Jonas became captivated by the museum's figures. She photographed many of them during her one-month residency in 2017 at the Gardner, one of few museums in the world that host artists as live-in guests. An exhibit celebrating this residency program opens on Oct. 17. Entitled \"In the Company of Artists: 25 Years of Artists-in-Residence,\" the show features seven female artists who, like Jonas, inhabited the museum and created works in response to its holdings. Working from her photographs, Jonas created the drawings using bamboo pens and red, green or blue ink on sheets of paper that are either 8M-by-8M or 11M-by-8M inches in size. This uniformity results in 55 individual works that form an ensemble. Occupying the museum's intimate Fenway Gallery, the drawings are grouped by the source materials of the original images: embroidery, lace, tapestry; marble, stone; ceramic, metal, porcelain, wood. Accompanying the exhibit is an enchanting book that reproduces each drawing and includes an interview with Jonas by Pieranna Cavalchini, the museum's curator of contemporary art, who also conducts the artist-in-residence program. In September, Cavalchini hosted a conversation and book-signing with Jonas, who lives and works in New York and Nova Scotia and seldom exhibits or performs in Boston. Currently the subject of a major touring retrospective organized by the Tate Modern, London, and representative of the U.S. at the 2015 Venice Biennale, Jonas is professor emeritus at the MIT Program in Art, Culture and Technology and one of three individuals honored with the 2018 Kyoto Prize. In November 2014, she and jazz pianist Jason Moran performed \"Reanimation,\" her multimedia work conjuring an endangered Arctic, at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. During her conversation with Cavalchini, Jonas describes her drawings as twice-removed from the original works because they were based on her photographs, which \"flattened\" the figures adorning the museum's furniture, sculptures, paintings and textiles. \"My drawings then became interpretations of both the artist's work and my photograph,\" Jonas writes in the book accompanying the exhibit. \"In a sense, my drawing is a third transformation. While I always try to show the essence of the animal, I am often surprised by the result, the spirit of the animal takes over.\" Indeed, the figures in her drawings have character. Depicted in cartoon-like contour, her animals are distilled to their essence, with a touch of humor, respect and whimsy. They are seldom still. Some interact. One rabbit mounts another. Pairs peck or eye each other. A whale wriggles and lions are personable, each with an expressive face. But no saccharine touches seep in. Also on view are tiny ceramic figures of animals from the artist's collection. In Jonas' drawings, the animals inhabiting the Gardner escape their settings and take on a life of their own. Her attention elevates these creatures from their supporting roles in the ornate furnishings and art. Her renderings also serve her larger interest in the survival of their living counterparts. \"I want to show how beautiful these creatures are,\" says Jonas, \"and what we're losing.\" ON THE WEB Learn more at: www.gardnermuseum.org \"In a sense, my drawing is a third transformation. While I always try to show the essence of the animal, I am often surprised by the result, the spirit of the animal takes over.\" - Joan Jonas",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"I think a lot of people may not be aware of the influence that black dance has had on American culture and how much it has shaped American culture,\" says Marianne Harkless Diabate, who founded the festival in 2016 with Baindu Conte-Coomber and Mckersin Previlus. \"Our mission is to bring communities together to increase cultural awareness and to elevate black dance in the area.\" This year, the group performance will work backwards chronologically, featuring contemporary dances and then working back to traditional African styles. Each teacher and/or teaching group will perform a separate vignette in the larger performance. Diabate also notes that there will be opportunity for audience participation. Among the many notable artists teaching workshops this year are Carl Alleyne, a native Bostonian teaching locking, global hip-hop artist and teacher Tweet Boogie, and Isaura Oliveira teaching Brazilian orixa from her native city of Salvador. The core of the festival is about joy and community. But the role of black dance and black history in our current culture is a key part of the dialogue as well. \"Black history has been sort of relegated to the sidelines. At this point I think it's largely regarded as something that's important for black people to learn. And what I want to stress is that it's important for everyone to learn, because it's the history of our country,\" says Diabate. The first iteration of the festival was held in Cambridge and garnered about 200 attendees to the workshops. This year the group expects to receive 500 participants. Those attending the festival can purchase a full festival pass, passes to attend a select number or workshops or just a ticket to the group performance. Community members interested in supporting the festival can donate on the Racines website. Diabate says the most rewarding part of the festival has been watching dancers (and newcomers) of all ages, races and experiences coming together to celebrate. \"My experience with black dance is that it's just about community and people,\" she says. \"So it makes you feel good doing it. It's accessible at many levels. It's dance from the heart.\" IF YOU GO WHAT: Racines Black Dance Festival WHEN: Friday-Sunday, October 18-20, 2019 WHERE: Workshops: Boston Conservatory at Berklee, Friday performance: Mainstage at Roxbury Community College TICKETS: www.racinesfestival.org/tickets \"My experience with black dance is that it's just about community and people. So it makes you feel good doing it. It's accessible at many levels. It's dance from the heart.\" Marianne Harkless Diabate, festival co-founder",

      "body": "FULL TEXT It is against this backdrop that the City of Boston must consider the proposed redevelopment of Suffolk Downs, one of the largest projects in the City's history. The proponent, HYM Investment Group, wants approval to develop around 10.5 million square feet on over 100 acres of the former racetrack site. HYM says it will create an entirely new neighborhood, featuring acres of open space, retail squares, condominiums, townhouses and commercial units. Suffolk Downs is certainly not the first project to leave its mark on East Boston in recent years. Since 2013,19 large residential projects have been approved by the BPDA, injecting approximately $700 million worth of construction into a historically working-class, immigrant neighborhood. But it is by far the largest, with an unmatched regional scope and impact. The project will fundamentally change the character, cost and composition of every community it touches. Suffolk Downs forces us to grapple with the central questions of gentrification: Who is this development for? What kind of city are we? Who belongs here? Questioning development does not necessarily mean opposing it. Massachusetts is the fastest growing state in the Northeast - construction is urgently needed to provide housing and amenities for new and old residents alike. But unchecked development, undertaken without regard for our most vulnerable communities, is not the answer. In order to ensure that Suffolk Downs is an equitable and sustainable addition to the civic life of Boston, HYM Investment must commit to the following steps: I Make half of the new residential units affordable. HYM has acknowledged that \"ongoing displacement pressures\" in East Boston are driving long-term residents out of their homes. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has estimated that Massachusetts must nearly double its stock of affordable apartments in order to support extremely low-income households, which would require the construction of over 4,000 affordable apartments per year. To help put a dent in this problem, half of the residential units at Suffolk Downs should be affordable - with rents set at an amount that reflects the actual earnings of East Boston residents and with half of these units featuring two or three bedrooms. HYM must also make a contribution to a housing stabilization fund for East Boston that represents a meaningful percentage of the cost of the overall project. I Go Green. Suffolk Downs must meet all construction standards outlined in the City of Boston's 2019 Climate Action Plan, including, but not limited to, ensuring the entire development is zero net carbon or energy positive. Given the urgency of the climate change crisis, the enormous and unprecedented footprint of Suffolk Downs and the lengthy anticipated construction period, there is no justification for noncompliance with the standard Boston has set for its future. I Prioritize local minority- and women-owned businesses. Unless proactive steps are taken, small community businesses will not reap the benefits of the new development. For example, despite the considerable public investment in the Seaport, people of color and immigrants were almost entirely shut out of the wealth generated by the project. Too, women- and minority-owned businesses in Boston are constantly overlooked for city contracts, receiving 1 percent of the over $600 million awarded in 2018. This must not happen with Suffolk Downs. HYM must prioritize contracts with locally-, women- and minority-owned small businesses for Suffolk Downs' commercial spaces to ensure this economic stimulus reaches the communities of color where it is so urgently needed. These commitments should not be seen as obligations; they are opportunities. Suffolk Downs does not have to represent exclusion and gentrification. Instead, the project can provide housing that is affordable, support climate resilience efforts and invite the community to share in the wealth it creates. Instead of supporting a project that further divides our city along race and class lines, the City of Boston can champion a new neighborhood that works for everyone. Lauren Sampson and Of en Ssllstrom are attorneys with Lawyers for Civil Flights. These commitments should not be seen as obligations; they are opportunities. Suffolk Downs does not have to represent exclusion and gentrification.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The business tapped $134,000 from the city's Community Preservation Act fund to pay for landscaping and drainage improvements on the site. The farm consists of a 4,600-square-foot Dutch-designed climate-controlled greenhouse in which We Grow Microgreens owners are growing the sprouted salad greens, fresh herbs, edible flowers and other produce they sell to local restaurants and at farmers' markets. Business owners Lisa Evans and Tim Smith began We Grow Microgreens with a 300-squarefoot greenhouse in the backyard of their Roslindale home. They estimate the new greenhouse will enable them to increase their output tenfold. Five years ago, they began the process of acquiring the long-vacant lot in Readville. The city sold the lot to them with the condition that it be used for urban agriculture. The designation as an urban farm enabled the business to apply for grants, including city and state funds. The group currently employs six Boston-area youth to work in the greenhouses. The greenhouse features an automated opening roof that allows the facility to ventilate in hot weather. A portion of the roof is equipped with translucent solar panels that help power the facility. The roof also features a rainwater collection system that feeds into tanks with a capacity to hold 7,500 gallons - more than enough for the farm's growing operations. In addition to the main greenhouse, now under construction are two smaller \"hoop houses\" - prefabricated green houses that extend the outdoor growing season - and raised beds. Inside the main greenhouse last week, Smith showed visiting city officials and chefs some of the more unusual edible plants, including piper auritum, the so-called root beer plant. Chefs use the plant, whose leaves taste like the soft drink, as an edible wrap. Microgreen production will remain the core of the business, according to Smith. The plants can be grown year round and don't require as much energy as most vegetables. \"With microgreens, the growing cycle is one-to-three weeks, he said. \"The typical growth period is 10 days. You don't need a lot of light.\" Unlike large-scale farms, the We Grow Microgreens farm is designed to blend into the local neighborhood. The hour-glassshaped field abuts a residential Readville neighborhood that City Councilor Tim McCarthy said is within sight of the house in which he grew up. At the ribbon-cutting, McCarthy noted the farm has a newly designed footpath, open to the public, that leads through the farm site's wooded land to state conservation land adjacent to the Mother Brook. \"This has been a five-year journey with the city of Boston,\" he said. \"It was well worth the wait.\" The Walsh administration recently released a food access agenda to evaluate existing food access initiatives and deliver actionable recommendations to fill gaps, including supporting urban farming in the City of Boston. City officials say the agenda will guide the city's work to ensure everyone has equitable access to affordable, fresh, healthy, and culturally-connected foods and to end food insecurity in Boston by 2030.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Organized by ICA staff members Eva Respini, chief curator, and Ruth Erickson, curator, with Ellen Tani, assistant curator, and Anni Pullagura, curatorial research fellow, the exhibition will begin to travel nationwide next year, appearing first at the Minneapolis Institute of Art and then moving to the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University. In Boston, the ICA's seaport site becomes part of the story, and the exhibition includes a strong local dimension. In a glassed-in walkway overlooking Boston Harbor, the exhibition concludes with a wall-size placard by artist Michelle Angela Ortiz, who quotes a woman being held at an ICE detention center, who told her, \"We are human beings, risking our lives for our families & our future.\" The placard faces the shipyard in East Boston that was from the 1920s to the '50s a major processing and detention center for immigrants. East Boston is home to more foreign-born residents than any other Boston neighborhood, and the shipyard is the location of the ICA's new Watershed site. \"When Home Won't Let You Stay\" begins in the ICA's lobby, where Boston artist and educator Anthony Romero has installed a replica of a street vendor's pushcart. The ICA has also enlisted Romero to coordinate a series of community events that will engage East Boston residents. Other ICA programs related to the show include gallery talks, tours, and workshops in collaboration with Mass Poetry and the International Institute of New England. Edited by Respini and Erickson, the exhibition's catalog offers an absorbing companion experience to the show, extending its reflections on home, boundaries, borders and belonging with rich illustrations and thoughtful essays by scholars and artists. Visible from the elevator as it rises to the fourth-floor galleries that house the show is a large blue banner by Havana-born New Yorker Tania Bruguera entitled \"Dignity Has No Nationality\" (2017). Founder of Queens-based Immigrant Movement International, an artist-run service center for newcomers, Bruguera has crafted a stitched map of Pangaea, the prehistoric super-continent that existed before formation of the earth's seven continents and here, an image of unity transcending political and geographic borders. Easily overlooked in the first gallery is a small but compelling object by Adrian Piper, a major American artist and philosopher who lives and teaches in Berlin, who has long explored racism and its fictions. She has emblazoned an oval mirror with a statement in gold leaf, \"Everything will be taken away,\" adapted from Aleksandr Solz-henitsyn's novel \"In the First Circle,\" in which a prisoner tells his torturer, \"The man from whom you've taken everything is no longer in your power; he is free again.\" Filling the opposite wall is \"Woven Chronicle\" (2011-16) by New Delhi-born Reena Saini Kallat, a world map that with electric cord twisted to resemble barbed wire outlines current trade and migration routes. Both an aural and visual experience, the installation emits a low drone suggesting ceaseless movement and an endless flux of exchange that connects and divides us. Do Ho Suh has crafted a series of walk-through replicas of his childhood home in Seoul in translucent yellow and pink polyester. Their blend of ephemeral fabric and precisely wrought dimensions evoke the chimera-like nature of memory. With an assortment of blue clothing arranged on the floor, Kader Attia's \"La Mer Morte (The Dead Sea)\" (2015) suggests rippling waves and memorializes those lost at sea while attempting to escape war-torn homelands in fragile, overcrowded boats. The U.S.-Mexico border is the focus of Guillermo Galindo and Richard Misrach's multi-year collaboration, \"Border Cantos\" (2004-16), which includes Misrach's haunting photograph of the wall meandering ribbon-like between a brooding sky and rolling hills. Nearby are raw sculptures that Galindo forged from discarded segments of the wall as well as left-behind gear and animal skeletons. Adaptation to a new home is a creative act rivaling any artistic endeavor, and Aliza Nisenbaum's large oil paintings celebrate an immigrant family she has befriended by rendering their daily life in the joyful palette of Mexican majolica tiles. British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare CBE has created an eloquent tribute to America as a nation of immigrants. Occupying an entire gallery is his \"The American Library\" (2018), a floor-to-ceiling installation of more than 6,000 books, each bound in Dutch wax cloth and imprinted in gold leaf with the name of a notable contributor to American history who is a first-or second-generation immigrant or descendant of participants in the Middle Passage or Great Migration. These individuals are as varied as W.E.B. DuBois, Toni Morrison, Steve Jobs and Donald Trump. Shonibare underscores his theme of multicultural hybridism with the fabrics covering the volumes-West-African batiks printed on Indonesian cottons imported through Dutch and English trade. Workstations enable visitors to access the installation's website to learn more about the people whose names appear on the bindings and add their own family migration stories. After all, with the exception of the country's surviving indigenous peoples, every American is an immigrant. \"In Boston, the ICA's seaport site becomes part of the story, and the exhibition includes a strong local dimension.\"",

      "body": "FULL TEXT What we're doing is based on improvisation a lot of the time. So as a trio we share, shall we say, aesthetic values that make it all extremely compatible. Playing together as long as Dave and I have also means that we have an extra level of comfort and language. And we all believe in the song, with a capital \"S.\" Part of the band's claim to fame is its indefinability: Popular tunes that you coax out sounds and meaning from that were implied in the original versions, but that you reshape. Maybe your version of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" is a good example - not a song one associates with jazz, but you make it legit. Your version, too, is so different from jazz pianist Robert Glasper's take. What's the attraction of the song for you? \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is one of the earliest of our so-called cover songs, and the idea of taking on this piece, which has massive cultural significance was, in part, to find that it lent itself to improvisation. Additionally, it has qualities somewhat like modal jazz, and Coltrane's \"A Love Supreme\" comes to mind. I would say that what we try to avoid is to 'make something into jazz,' per se; we're more of the mindset that a song can be a blank slate, and look within it to find something else that's there. It's almost like sculpture: Removing the marble to see the figure inside. The Bad Plus is often referred to as \"avant-garde,\" which can mean so many things to so many people. Does the term mean anything to you when applied to your music? Well, 'avant-garde' I think it gives us a license to explore. It's an opportunity to use our imagination, to push boundaries. These boundaries appear in all facets of our lives. We're within the 21st century. We don't need to be afraid. It's like this: Now that we can do anything, what will we do? Given the extraordinary difference between what The Bad Plus is doing compared to other jazz musicians, did you ever consider other genres as primary? I mean, you attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, which is focused on classical music rather than jazz. That ties into the avant-garde. The Bad Plus is a safe haven for us to be who we are. Who among us lives in a pure environment, musical or otherwise? My introduction to music, for example, was listening to rock radio while growing up in the Twin Cities. I still love that music and listen to it. Why deny it? There's a lot of valuable information there. I think it's funny that people have an attitude about that. I love a good hook! That music serves a purpose, and jazz ignores that at its peril. What you do is really inspiring for young musicians who are just building confidence while trying to integrate their personal musical interests into the form of jazz. How did that come about for you? It comes from acknowledging what's going on around you. And it helps to be in a community, however small, that's supportive of that. As a young musician, I was narrow-minded - at least that's how I look at it now. You either move from that or you don't. I remember a point of opening up, and finding that very liberating, and very fruitful. Does The Bad Plus have any current, past, or historical connections to the music scene in Boston? None of us went to school here or lived in Boston, but in New York we fell in with the post-Berklee and post-New England Conservatory crowds. As a musician, you can't help but interact with people who have come through Boston one way or another. ... what we try to avoid is to make something into jazz, per se; we're more of the mindset that a song can be a blank slate, and within it to find something else that's there.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Now, Wescon has more than 40 employees - all people of color - with major clients like Emerson College and Millennium Partners, to whom Conrad says the business owes much of its growth. Wescon's current contract with Millennium Partners involves a construction site on the corner of Winthrop and Devonshire, a $1.5 billion project. Conrad says when it comes to construction site protection, much of the job in a densely populated city like Boston involves keeping passersby safe. \"Even if [the site] is fenced off, people will find a way to get past those fencings, so a lot of construction companies are very careful about making sure that they have some sort of visual protection and also a physical presence as well,\" Conrad says. Wescon also has many contracts with schools, including the Match Charter School, with whom they worked for around 20 years. \"There are a lot of major shootings in schools,\" Conrad says. \"Regarding Match School, it was really for the formulation of their preschool and just making sure those kids were looked out for and were in a safe environment, because we're talking about the inner city.\" Wescon's work with Match also included property protection. A security team was in charge of protecting Match School buildings at night after instances of theft and vandalism. Besides commitment to his clients, Conrad's says his main focus is his employees. \"We've made a concerted effort to make sure that we hire from within the city,\" says Conrad. \"And that was really important because just about 100 percent of our business is in the Boston area, so we wanted to make sure we reflected that community.\" While Conrad and his partner made an intentional effort to hire people of color, he says that also just seemed to be the demographic walking through his door - primarily Latino, African American, Haitian and Caribbean folks. When it comes to hiring, Conrad focuses on opportunity. \"I think that one of the things that you come across in terms of workforce development is, a lot of people that are not getting an opportunity are people from the black and brown community. So what we wanted to do is give people an opportunity to create something for themselves,\" Conrad says, and this holds true whether they stay at Wescon or use it as a stepping stone to other ventures. To be considered for a job, he says, applicants need only a high school degree, decent writing skills and fair fluency in English, although even that is not mandatory - many Wescon employees have been English learners. And while other security firms employ a significant percentage of people of color, Conrad says most of them are not minority-owned businesses like Wescon. Wescon competes with international conglomerates, some with over 300,000 employees across multiple countries. Many businesses in Downtown Boston employs such firms, and while their employees are often black or brown, Conrad says, \"they're not from the Boston area, they don't know the people, they're not able to understand all the dynamics that come with that.\" While Wescon is small in comparison, Conrad says they stand apart in their commitment to creating change and opportunities within the Boston community. Looking forward, Conrad plans to continue expanding the business and increase its staff size. He says Wescon is working with developers on new opportunities coming soon. We've made a concerted effort to make sure that we hire from within the city. And that was really important because just about 100 percent of our business is in the Boston area, so we wanted to make sure we reflected that community.\" - Mark Conrad",

This year, fewer small businesses in the Commonwealth relied on SBA lending, but business owners that needed the access to capital used SBA loan programs for higher-value projects. Through the SBAs flagship 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program 1,593 loans were approved in Massachusetts for a total of more than $357 million supported by a network of 118 lenders, including 12 credit unions. Eastern Bank was the number one SBA 7(a) lender in Massachusetts for the 11th year in a row and number one 7(a) lender in New England for the 10th year in a row, with 415 loans totaling $41.66 million. The 504 Loan Program approved 247 loans, supporting more than $156.31 million. Third Party loans, which are part of the 504 projects, totaled in excess of $205.55 million. Bay Colony Development Corporation was SBAs highest producer of 504 loans in Massachusetts, with 92 loans totaling $56.31 million. The SBA Microloan program, through 10 microloan intermediaries, approved 131 loans totaling $2.33 million. Massachusetts microloan approvals increased by 22 percent and dollar amount increased by 12.5 percent; this was the largest growth area in the state. Accion East, Inc. approved 33 SBA Microloans totaling over $451,000 in fiscal year 2019 - more than a quarter of all microloans in the state. Dorchester Bay Economic Development Corporation was named the Massachusetts Breakout Microlending Intermediary of the year, with 22 microloans approved, totaling over $237,900 in fiscal year 2019- Their activity this year represented a 220 percent increase in approvals. While the majority of the loans went to established businesses, about 29 percent of total loan approvals went to new businesses, two years old or less. Cambridge Savings Bank was the Lender of the Year to New Businesses, with 64 percent of their loans going to new businesses this fiscal year.

Urtubey is a relatively new hire herself, having served in her position for just over a year now. Though the Fields Corner program director was filled just days ago, the Dudley Square and Chinatown programs are currently looking to hire directors. Former Dudley Square Main Streets Director Joyce Stanley retired last week after having worked with Boston's Main Streets program since its inception. The Dudley Square Main Streets program office is still developing its hiring process as it plans to fill Stanley's position. Chinatown's program director position has been vacant for longer, and Roslindale's district director just went on maternity leave. Taylor Connolly, communications manager for the city's Office of Economic Development, says the Main Streets program director position requires a hands-on approach. \"You're getting to know your businesses and residents,\" she said. For the holiday shopping season, Boston's Economic Development Office and small business communities have launched a \"20 districts in 20 days\" campaign, which began on Monday. The purpose of the campaign is to encourage local small business spending during the holidays, Connolly says, as well as to highlight the investments the office has made in the Main Streets program. So when doing your holiday shopping, keep it local - look no farther than your city's neighborhood business districts.

      "body": "FULL TEXT This report tells us what we have known for years: Our system is ill, and it requires bold, urgent action. In June, I released an action plan called Action for Boston Children to address the badly needed steps that should be taken to directly address the inequity that exists in our city's schools. Releasing this plan as the superintendent entered her role ensured she could see it and incorporate it into her strategic planning for the district. I'm well past the point (and I know the majority of BPS families are as well) of reading another report on the systematic issues that the district faces. We don't need the temperature taken again. We need a prescription, a remedy. We want action. The pillars of my plan are not revolutionary concepts, but they would have revolutionary results if implemented. These include restructuring central office so that it serves students, families and schools, not the other way around; creating true access to quality public schools across the city; creating early education supports and opportunities for children and families that begin at birth; and finally, ensuring all our high schools prepare students for success. First and foremost, let's be honest about the data on school quality and share it in a way that families can understand. Let's set and publicize a goal for expanding the number of high-quality seats - known as Tier 1 - across the city, especially for English Language Learners and students with special needs who absolutely deserve better access to our high-quality schools. Let's map the continuum of early education options for kids from birth to age five, and deliver an actual, high-quality pre-K seat to every child in Boston. Let's publicize annual reports with parent satisfaction data and concrete steps central office will take to improve engagement with families and support for schools. Let's establish common graduation standards across high schools, while allowing our schools to develop innovative models unique to their student populations. And most importantly, let's improve the home-based assignment formula to enhance equity across the entire district. These actions are all within the city's power, and don't require millions of dollars to implement, but will put more information into the hands of parents, add more accountability for central office, and take real steps to increase equity in our school system. They are also in direct response to what parents are telling us they want and need. As a BPS graduate who attended five schools in the district - all of which were excellent - I know firsthand that our schools have the potential to transform a young person's life and set them up for success. But I also know that this system fails too many students in our city, like my twin brother who attended BPS schools that weren't even accredited, cycled in and out of the criminal justice system, and passed away at age 29 while in the custody of the Department of Correction. Boston's young people have waited too long for action and accountability, and every day is a missed opportunity. We can make these changes if we work together as a community - students, families, school leaders, elected officials and the city - so I hope you'll join me in calling for action for Boston children. We can't wait for the next report. We need to act. Andrea J. Campbell is Boston City Council president and District 4 councilor, representing largely Dorchester, Mattapan and parts of Jamaica Plain and Hoslindale This report tells us what we have known for years: Our system is ill, and it requires bold, urgent action.\" -Andrea Campbell",

Wentworth is less than two miles from the neighborhood where Janey grew up riding his bicycle on summer days like any other kid from the block. Janey, 57, the president and owner of Janey Construction Management and Consulting Inc., attributes his business success to hard work and his Wentworth education, which instilled in him a deep commitment to higher learning and determination to help others get into and graduate from the university. Janey received an associate degree in architectural technology from the institute in '82, stuck with his studies at Wentworth and launched his business with his cousin in Dorchester in 1984. Janey recalls that their office then was a kitchen table. Juggling work and school while keeping the new business afloat, he completed the requirements for his bachelor's in construction management from Wentworth in 2004. In 2017, in a sign of how far he had come, the university asked Janey to give the keynote address at commencement and awarded him an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree. Janey is the first African American to chair Wentworths board, which he joined in 2013 after serving a couple years as a corporator at the institute. He's also served as an adjunct professor at Wentworth. Janey has a master's degree in civil engineering from Northeastern University. A past president of the Massachusetts division of the Construction Management Association of America and vice chair of CMAA's national board, he has more than 30 years' experience in his field, ranging from residential to commercial projects worth $5 million to $500 million.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The Green New Deal Innovation Center (GNDIC) would include a commercial greenhouse, a commercial food waste composting operation, a food industry training center and a commercial food preparation and delivery operation. The overarching aim of the business park, proponents say, is to help local food-industry startups and established businesses continue to grow in Boston and create and preserve employment for local residents. Rising rents are part of what pushed the group to consider the site, according to Lor Holmes, a co-founder of CERO, a commercial food waste composting cooperative that is part of the Neponset Cooperative Trust. \"For the last five years we've been looking for land in the city of Boston,\" she said. CERO lost their warehouse space in the Newmarket business area recently, due to pressure from developers. They were able to find another warehouse in the same area, but the space is not compatible with their long-term needs. \"We'll outgrow that before too long,\" Holmes said. City Fresh Foods, a meal preparation and catering firm and another member of the trust, is facing similar pressure on its Newmarket location. While lease rates in Roxbury and Dorchester average $22.66 per square foot, Neponset Cooperative Trust members say local food-based businesses require leases around $15 per square foot. The group plans to offer substantially-discounted lease rates to businesses and nonprofits including the Commonwealth Kitchen, About Fresh/Fresh Truck and Chinese Golden Age. \"This would be an opportunity to co-locate and operate this land as a trust,\" CERO's Holmes said of the Boston State parcel. \"If we do this, it's a way of creating affordable rents for ourselves as well as locating other businesses there.\" Members of the team include CERO Cooperative; City Fresh Foods, Inc.; Hurst Landscape; and Westland Gate Capital, LLC, a financing and business advisory firm. The plans for the site submitted by the team include a 42,600-square-foot commercial greenhouse, an acre of outdoor urban farm space, buildings for Hurst Landscaping, CERO and City Fresh, a cooperative grocery, a training center and a business incubator space. \"Our goal would be to have a stable space,\" said Sheldon Lloyd, CEO of City Fresh. \"Someplace we don't have to worry about moving from.\" Lloyd's business grew from 80 employees to 120 over the past year, but the rent on his Newmarket location increased by 200 percent. The City Fresh workforce, more than 80 percent of whom live in Boston, are competing against national and international firms. Lloyd says he can keep his business growing and remain competitive and keep local workers employed if he can control costs. \"The biggest threat isn't the size of our facility,\" he said. \"It's the affordability.\" Neponset Cooperative Trust is one of six teams bidding for the 10-acre parcel. The other five teams include nonprofit and for-profit developers seeking to build housing on the site. The state-appointed Community Advisory Committee, which makes recommendations to the state Division of Capital Asset Management and Maintenance, is expected to begin meetings to review proposals in January. This would be an opportunity to co-locate and operate this land as a trust. If we do this, it's a way of creating affordable rents for ourselves as well as locating other businesses there.\" -Lor Holmes",

      "body": "FULL TEXT In addition making classical music accessible, Martinson hopes to break down the stereotype that orchestral music is stuffy. \"I feel that there are a lot of qualities in classical music that are similar to rock, rap, any genre that you like,\" she says. \"Any really good music hits us all in the same place. Some Baroque pieces also can be really, really exciting and full of life. And I think a lot of people are under the impression that it might be boring.\" Boston Baroque is a particularly unique musical experience because it's not just classical music, but classical scores played on instruments and using techniques that reflect the era of those musical compositions. This might mean some of the instruments are smaller in size or made of different materials, for example flutes and clarinets made of wood rather than metal. The different materials also require the instruments to be played in a different way. These small changes make a big impact on the sound of the instrument and therefore reflect a more accurate Baroque musical experience. Boston Baroque was the first permanent Baroque orchestra established in North America and still holds the legacy as oldest period instrument orchestra in the United States. Safe to say, they know a thing or two about baroque music. \"I think the family-friendly aspect of the community concert is also very important, as kids are not always welcome and certainly not always encouraged to attend a regular classical music concert,\" says Martinson. \"This is a wonderful opportunity for them to hear and see the magic of live classical music.\" She describes the concert as being more relaxed than your typical concert hall, audience members often clap or shout verbal appreciation for the music as it's played, which brings an extra sense of fun to the performance. \"There's nothing like seeing live music,\" says Martinson. \"Nothing substitutes for being in the present moment.\" Ticket reservations are available through the Boston Baroque website as well as at the Uphams Corner branch of the Boston Public Library, the Strand Theatre box office and all other Boston Public Library branches in Dorchester.

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"If you go to any other mainstream theater in Boston, you'll see that 90-plus percent of the audiences are non-diverse,\" says Williams. \"And outside of 'Black Nativity,' Urban Nutcracker' and Alvin Alley Dance Theater,' there aren't very many shows that are reflective of the population of Greater Boston.\" And this production truly is representative of the Boston community. Not only is the cast pulled from the local talent pool, almost 25 percent of the children's cast is related to one another. There are five brother-sister teams performing together on stage this year. The show isn't just about providing dancers of color with opportunities. It's also about making the show accessible for local audiences. As a result, the story is set right here in Boston, with all the trimmings of the city, including the Citgo sign, the Public Garden, a Dorchester street corner and the Top of the Hub. Tchaikovsky shares the score with jazzy notes by Duke Ellington, an old-school doo-wop group and hip-hop beats. This year, \"Urban Nutcracker\" features some changes. Clara has been upgraded to a new lead character, Ruby, who is a teenager. Though this change was made because of the talent pool, it also serves to promote the prolonging of childhood wonder as long as possible. A new number based on the classic children's book \"Make Way for Ducklings\" will also debut, and the Russian dance sequence has been re-choreographed. As the production has grown into new spaces and new phases, so has Williams' ability to bring in the community. \"This year one of my sponsors, Adage Capital, sponsored 3,000 free tickets for community groups, which are being distributed through the Boch Center,\" he says. \"It's for folks that wouldn't have the opportunity otherwise to see the show.\" Although the show always has provided some free tickets for accessibility, this is the first time the program is sponsored, and it's the largest number of tickets they've ever been able to give away. Williams wants to keep the show as open to audiences as possible despite its move from the Strand to downtown Boston. He says, \"It's good for people to come and see the diversity on stage, and also, when they look around themselves, to see the diversity in the audience.\" ON THE WEB More info and tickets at: urbannutcracker.com The story is set right here in Boston, with all the trimmings of the city, including the Citgo sign, the Public Garden, a Dorchester street corner and the Top of the Hub.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The play's absurdist style (a la \"Waiting for Godot\") presents very real systemic problems in an often hilarious, often terrifying format. \"To see something that's in the deep pockets of black culture that's flipped up into the absurd, I think that's really awesome,\" says Bennett. \"It's hard for people to see situations that they are close to or a part of, but if you put it in a different context, it's easier to digest. Plus, it's satire and it's hilarious and the sugar helps the medicine go down.\" Written by Antoinette Nwandu, the play was first performed in May 2017 and was adapted into a film by Spike Lee in 2018 for a premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Though the content is contemporary and rooted heavily in the present day police violence against people of color, the material also draws on the historical experiences of black people, the centuries of oppression that have led to this moment. But \"Pass Over\" is not all heavy conversations. Tonal balance is key here, and director Monica White Ndounou strikes a delicate balance between the pain and struggle and the joy and hilarity inside young boys. \"Through enslavement, emancipation, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights movement - every generation, we're in another struggle,\" says Ndounou. \"But even in that struggle, we find ways to access joy. And to identify ways in which we do have power.\" Cius says the fun and humor of the show were what drew him to it. As the youngest of six, Cius identified with Kitch, a character with a younger-brother quality to him, both nagging and unendingly loyal. \"The experiences of men of color, black men in particular, can be very similar because of our skin color. I may not have gone through specific issues that Kitch and Moses go through, but I certainly know people who have, and I understand that it could happen to me any day,\" says Cius. Perhaps most striking about \"Pass Over\" is that it shows the power of the ordinary. Nwandu describes Moses and Kitch as being two ordinary black boys. They're not prodigies, they're not performers, they don't have hoop dreams; they're just trying to live. And they shouldn't need to be exceptional to do that. Director Ndounou stresses that she's tried to create a safe space for the actors to perform this piece and for the audience members of color to experience it. But she also hopes it will strike a chord. \"The Boston area is more segregated in some ways than many places I've lived in other areas of the country,\" says Ndounou. \"I would hope that audiences coming into this play will reflect on how this story is connected to the larger narrative about what this country is and how it treats all of its people.\" ON THE WEB For ticketsand info, visit: www.speakeasystage.com/pass-over \"To see something that's in the deep pockets of black culture that's flipped up into the absurd, I think that's really awesome\" - Kadahj Bennett",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Nase, who was a public-school teacher for two years before pursuing his passion for performing, earned his Bachelor of Music degree in Choral Music Education from the University of North Texas College of Music and his Master of Music degree in Vocal Performance/Musical theatre from NYU. Prior to joining the \"Cats\" national touring production, Nase was part of \"The Black Clown,\" which opened the 2018-2019 season of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. That show was adapted from Langston Hughes' 1931 poem about the black experience in America. The musical fused jazz, ragtime, African American spirituals and opera to bring Hughes' words to life onstage. Nase, in a recent phone interview with the Banner, describes the audition and callback experience for \"The Black Clown.\" He was one of 25 black actors in the room. Reading the poem and singing \"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\" in the group setting, he says, was unlike any experience he had ever had. \"I remember when I booked it, I was ecstatic,\" he recalls. \"Cats\" was adapted by Andrew Lloyd Webber from T.S. Eliot's 1939 \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.\" The musical premiered at the New London Theatre on London's West End in 1981, and a year later opened on Broadway, where it ran for 18 years and almost 7,500 performances. \"Cats\" has been translated into 15 languages and seen by more than 73 million people worldwide in more than 30 countries. The premise of the renowned musical is that once a year, a group of cats gather together for the \"Jellicle Ball,\" where the leader of the group, Old Deuteronomy, selects one cat to ascend to the Heaviside Layer to be reborn into a new life. Nase is often drawn to projects by their entirety rather than by a specific role, he says. For him, it's about whether the musical is able to \"transport someone out of their current place and time\" - and he's found that with \"Cats.\" As the production has traveled across the United States, audiences have expressed their delight in seeing the show again as adults and bringing their own children or grandchildren to relive the history and magic of the musical. In playing Old Deuteronomy, Nase's goal was not to recreate the role, but to approach it with a fresh perspective and bring whatever he could of himself into the character, including his experience as a father of two children. Through rehearsals, he slowly peeled back the layers of Old Deuteronomy, he explains, to see him as a father figure and \"a loving warm presence.\" The Amarillo, Texas native also was able to draw from his experiences growing up with his grandmother, who had many cats. \"It wasn't hard for me to dig back into my memory, when we would be crawling around the floor like cats, and remembering the older cats that my grand-mama had, the way that they were, and the way that they weren't,\" recalls the actor. \"It was definitely an explorative moment for me in that I was able to bring human characteristics that I wanted to for this character, but then you also have to bring in those catlike characteristics.\" IF YOU GO Tickets: www.BroadwaylnBoston.com, via Ticketmaster at 800-982-2787 or in person at Citizens Bank Opera House Box Office, 539 Washington Street, Boston.",

Directed by Obie award-winner Lee Sunday Evans and starring Drama Desk nominee Eric Berry-man as the title character, the play runs through Feb. 16 at the Emerson Paramount Center in Boston. Called \"the best verse playwright in America\" by New York Magazine, the renowned playwright, performer and educator is also widely known as one of the pioneers and co-creators of hip-hop theater, alate-20th-century art form that led the way for future iconic works such as Lin-Manuel Miranda's \"Hamilton.\" Power has created a unique fusion of original music, rhymed dialogue and choreography. Long fascinated by what he describes as the \"dynamic change\" in Malcolm's life, Power spoke with individuals from Roxbury who knew Malcolm as a young man and held workshops with community members as part of his research. Many of the people he spoke to, who are now in their 80s, didn't consider Malcolm to be from Boston or a Boston figure, and they didn't see him with the same reverence that so many others do around the country and the world For others, the legacy is complex. Power's grandfather, who knew Malcolm in New York in the 1960s, liked what Malcolm was trying to do but didn't like some of his methods or the ways he was trying to do it, according to Power. \"Detroit Red\" takes place primarily in Boston, with a few scenes involving travels to and from New York. It features moments in his life when he worked as a soda fountain clerk at Townsend Drugstore in Roxbury and as a bus boy at the Parker House in downtown Boston. Through the play and Berry-man's portrayal of Malcolm, Power says, he hopes that audiences will understand \"the complexities of humanity.\" He wants viewers to see and learn \"how Malcolm X became Malcolm X.\" Power believes that it wasn't just Malcolm X's innate gift of intelligence and being an amazing wordsmith, and his charisma and bravery, that shaped him, but also his time in Boston and all the challenges that he faced.

      "body": "FULL TEXT RCC recently underwent a massive transformation. Roberson oversaw a $72.5 million campus renovation project, with a $20 million investment in green energy. The school currently has 23 unique energy conservation measures in place. The new program adheres to many of the City of Boston's environmental goals, including to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Frank Mruk, the executive director of the Center for Smart Building Technology, said that the world is facing a climate crisis. \"Cities are starting 2050-car-bon-neutral goals, like this city has,\" he said. \"And to reach those goals you [have to] focus on energy efficiency, and alternative energy and electricity, and there really isn't a sustainable workforce to do that sort of thing ... this curriculum is almost like a new technology.\" Energy efficiency industries are growing faster than ever before. Cities worldwide are replacing old heating, cooling and lighting systems with more sustainable options. The aim of smart building technology is to reduce the staggering greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. buildings, which account for nearly one-third of total GHG emissions in the United States, according to RCC. Currently, more than 80% of commercial construction includes some type of smart building technology. Throughout the RCC program, students will learn techniques to adapt to the ever-changing industry. These students can learn the exact employment skills they need to be successful, said Roberson. \"They are learning building management techniques,\" she said. \"And so it might be the old people that were employed in heating and cooling. But now the industry has advanced, so it might be geother-mal energy or solar energy that they're learning, as buildings start replacing old systems with more high-efficiency energy systems.\" Mike Kennealy, Massachusetts secretary of housing and economic development, said that this program gives students exposure to emerging industries. It makes people aware of these opportunities and gives them the workforce skills they need. \"We help fund programs like this that are exciting workforce training opportunities to help provide great pathways for our young people into exciting industries,\" he said. \"And this is certainly among those programs.\" Roberson noted that the program sets students up for stable jobs. \"It's a position that pays a livable wage,\" she said. \"And so students can finish with an associate's degree and get as much as $65,000 to start. And for people in this community who sometimes don't have access to those types of jobs, it's a great thing for the college to be able to provide that kind of training and opportunities for students.\" Kennealy said that the carbon neutrality goal was an important goal for the environment. He also noted that Massachusetts has the ability to be at the forefront of new industry. \"This is an industry we can lead in,\" he said. \"And in Massachusetts, if we can stake out leadership positions in exciting growth industries, and then make sure we have the workforce for those industries, that's really how you have a great economic development strategy, we think.\" Equity, too, will be integral to the center's purpose. Mruk noted that the new program's mission statement ends with \"a sense of urgency and environmental equity.\" Environmental equity ensures that no community, regardless of location or income level, bears a disproportionate burden of environmental hazards. It also guarantees that communities have an equal say and can contribute meaningful input when addressing the climate crisis. \"Any time that you look at statistics about which communities are going to be most impacted if we aren't carbon neutral - or if we're not more conscious about the effects of climate change - it's going to be centered in low-income communities,\" said Roberson. \"They're going to be the hardest hit, most affected by pollutants and those types of things. And for Roxbury Community College, in the midst of this kind of community, to be deliberate in preparing folks that can be a part of the solution is very important.\" City Council President Kim Janey noted that the racial wealth gap in Boston is a quarter-of-a-million dollars, and that many families find themselves with barriers that seem \"insurmountable.\" She acknowledged the importance of finding new pathways out of poverty. \"This is so important, because we need to be thinking about new pathways of opportunities for folks so we can all enjoy living in our great city of Boston,\" she said. \"And that there is, in fact, truly shared prosperity and economic opportunities.\" The Center for Smart Building Technology has only just opened, but the excitement at the ceremony was palpable. Kennealy expressed optimism for the future of the program. \"There's tremendous talent here,\" he said. \"It's all about, again, making young people aware of the opportunities and training them. One of our core principles in our economic development plan is equitable opportunity, making sure everyone's got a chance to be on the playing field.\" It's a position that pays a livable wage. And so students can finish with an associate's degree and get as much as $65,000 to start.\" -Valerie Roberson",

      "body": "FULL TEXT The name Reevx is meant to incorporate the words revolution and evolution and the \"x\" in Berkshire Bank's logo. Berkshire Bank Executive Vice President Malia Lazu says the lab is part of the bank's commitment to revolutionizing banking in traditionally low-income communities and helping entrepreneurs evolve their businesses. \"What we really want is a space where entrepreneurs can work collaboratively,\" Lazu told the Banner. Entrepreneurs and nonprofit workers can sign up as members of Reevx Labs by first entering their names and emails into Berkshire's database. They can then reserve space in the 2,200-square-foot lab's conference room, workstations or multifunction room. While the lab does not function as a bank branch, and bank employees there do not accept deposits, entrepreneurs working there have access to bank services and can open accounts, consult with bank officials and apply for small business loans and nontra-ditional business startup loans of up to $20,000. With more than $12 billion in deposits, Berkshire Bank is ranked 17th nationwide for small-business lending. Even non-entrepreneurial walk-ins will be able to meet with and receive advice and help from bank employees, Lazu said. \"Financial planning and one-on-one banking shouldn't just be offered to people in private wealth management programs,\" she said. \"We want to bank everyone with dignity.\" Days after the lab's Jan. 22 launch, those occupying workstations in the lab were evenly split between Berkshire employees, local nonprofit workers and entrepreneurs. A local plumber who is seeking to prototype \"smart\" bathroom appliances sat on a leather couch, chatting with Lazu, who advises him on how to get patents for his work. Two Berkshire employees and two others worked on laptops on the solid oak-topped tables and 18-foot bench facing the workspace's front window. In a conference room was a group working on a business startup. Lazu said the space was inspired in part by the tech giant Google's community space in San Francisco. The guiding principle behind the space is that entrepreneurs face better chances at succeeding in their ventures when they're in community with other entrepreneurs and people who offer complementary services. \"When you're around other entrepreneurs who are in different phases or the same as you, you can learn from each other,\" she said. \"People help each other problem-solve. Bringing entrepreneurs together creates an ecosystem of small businesses who can work together.\" Professional help will also be available, whether it be from Berkshire Bank staff or others. Business assistance groups will have a steady presence in the space, Lazu said, highlighting the consulting firm Msaada Partners, which helps startups obtain capital for their ventures. The Reevx Labs location in Roxbury is the first of many the bank plans to open, Lazu said. The next lab will open in Springfield, and the bank also looking to open labs in Philadelphia, Providence, and in cities in New Jersey and New York. But as the first lab to open, the Roxbury branch serves as the guiding light for the others, Lazu said. \"This is our flagship,\" she said.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Besides administrative support, her company provides event and meeting coordination, writing services and social media management. Hernandez says that she owes her entire career to Dr. Lindsa Mclntyre, the current High School Superintendent of Boston Public Schools and Hernandez's mentor. Hernandez worked alongside Mclntyre for 10 years. As Mcln-tyre's administrative assistant, she was introduced to high profile business owners, philanthropists and executives. \"They would say to me, 'I need someone like you,' and Lindsa would say, 'Well, you can't have her!'\" Hernandez says. Mclntyre eventually gave her blessing, says Hernandez. She decided to chase her dreams, secure in the knowledge that she could return to education if her plan didn't work out. Now, Hernandez says, people in her community always joke, \"Oh, you have Wendy as an assistant? I do too.\" \"It's become like, 'Oh, if you're a small business and you need an executive assistant, call Wendy,\" says Hernandez. \"I think that in my case, like I said, I was fortunate because I had that connection, but there is definitely a need for small businesses to connect with high profile business owners and just people in general.\" Hernandez says that as an entrepreneur, she likes to work on things that haven't been designed yet, especially when using her knowledge and abilities to modify her approach for different clients. \"I love the initial stake of starting the business,\" she says. She gains satisfaction from problem-solving and trying to figure out what works best for a certain industry. Hernandez also notes that she works with a lot of black-owned and minority-owned businesses. \"I feel very connected to that, as a woman of color myself,\" she says. According to a 2016 studyfromthe City of Boston, over 20,000 Dominicans live in Boston. Hernandez is one of them. \"There are not a lot of people that do this in the Boston area that are of color,\" she says. \"So that to me is why it's important to have that representation of people that look like me, that are able to work with high profile people that are also people of color.\" Hernandez notes that there are significant barriers that prevent people of color from networking with wealthy individuals. \"How do you get into the circle of wealth if you don't have the connections?\" she asks. Hernandez says that she wouldn't have even been able to meet high-profile people, let alone work with them, had it not been for her mentor. \"When I first started, no one knew me,\" she says. \"They were like, 'Who is this person?' but because [Mclntyre] vouched for me, I was able to get in with people that I otherwise would not have been able to.\" Hernandez hopes to continue LionsPride's expansion, and she expressed gratitude for working with \"awesome, amazing, brilliant minds that trust me to handle their operation and their day-to-day things.\" She says that some of her clients have been featured in Forbes Magazine, and working with them on a daily basis is \"so humbling.\" LionsPride's name has a double meaning. On one hand, a group of lions is called a \"pride,\" and Hernandez says she feels like she's the mother lion caring for her pack. She also says her astrological sign is Leo, which represents certain values. \"There are three things that I stand for, that my business stands for: honesty, loyalty and integrity,\" she says. \"So when I think of clients that I want to work with ... if there isn't integrity, I will not work with them.\" Looking forward, Hernan-dezsays she may begin training employees to work as administrative assistants as well. \"I am so busy. And I would love to connect with other people that want to do this,\" she says. \"I would love to train them and be able to offer my services to more people. You know, kind of like, clone myself in a way.\" Hernandez grew up in Boston's foster care system, she says, and is certain she wouldn't be in this position had it not been for her mentor. \"I think that what I would like to say is how important it is to have mentors, because she helped me have that confidence to be able to talk to people of wealth,\" she says. \"I did not grow up with that, and because [Mclntyre] took an interest in me, and she being a woman of color herself, that really opened a lot of doors for me.\" There are three things that I stand for, that my business stands for: honesty, loyalty and integrity. So when I think of clients that I want to work with... if there isn't integrity, I will not work with them.\" -Wendy Hernandez",

Print Ain't Dead, a local pop-up bookstore geared toward people of color is also taking online orders and offering online poetry experiences via its Insta-gram account, @print.aint.dead. These books by black authors could provide just the right amount of relief from the stresses of the unknown. IMonfiction \"The Black Book\" assembles poems, essays, advertisements, sheet music, historical documents and many other elements in an exploration of African American life in the United States. Though edited by Roger Furman, Middleton A. Harris, Morris Levitt and Ernest Smith and featuring an introduction by Bill Cosby, Toni Morrison was the unsung champion and compiler of the book, published in 1974. Children's Literature In \"A Child's Introduction to African American History: The Experiences, People, and Events That Shaped Our Country\" author Jabari Asim fills in the gaping holes of school textbooks with vibrant stories from black history in the United States. Talented African Americans are highlighted in areas from politics to sports to entertainment. Fiction Ta-Nehisi Coates' newest novel, \"The Water Dancer,\" follows a young enslaved man, Hiram Walker, who escapes bondage in Virginia and flees north. Once there, he becomes involved in the dangerous and fervent underground war against slavery, but he never forgets the family he left behind in Virginia. Mystery \"They all Fall Down\" by Rachel Howzell Hall pays homage to Agatha Christie's \"And Then There Were None.\" Miriam Macy sets off for a luxurious private island vacation with six other strangers. Upon arrival, the group realizes they've all been brought there under false - and malicious - pretenses. Fantasy In \"Children of Blood and Bone\" by Tomi Adeyemi, protagonist Zelie Adebola channels the West African Orisha gods to fight back against a ruthless monarch, with the help of a few other outcasts along the way. As a bonus, the sequel to this novel was just released, making for double the reading. Science Fiction Take it back to the classics with Octavia Butler's best-selling novel, \"Kindred.\" The book follows a female African American writer who finds herself time-traveling between her Los Angeles home and a plantation in pre-Civil War Maryland, where she meets her ancestors. Written in 1979, \"Kindred\" has continued to be a classic in black American literature to this day. Bookstores and libraries are closed temporarily, but readers are encouraged . to order online from local bookshops.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Public health researchers have long warned that an individual's zip code is a better predictor of their health than their own genetic code. Your zip code determines your relationship to a multitude of social determinants of health, ranging from access to green spaces and reliable transportation, availability of healthcare services and healthy foods, and proximity to industrial waste and pollution. The unequal distribution of these resources can influence the health of entire communities. For example, exposure to air pollution is associated with higher levels of cardiovascular and respiratory disease, while living in an older residential building in crowded and unsanitary conditions may lead to increased levels of lead in the blood, as well as asthma. Because of the lingering effects of redlining and other racist federal housing policies, which presaged today's continuing racial wealth gap, many American zip codes - particularly in urban regions - remain racially segregated. To take the example of St. Louis, Missouri, a single road divides a \"poor, predominantly African-American neighborhood\" from a \"more affluent, largely white neighborhood.\" Whether you live to the north or south of the line predicts the likelihood that you attained a bachelor's degree, or the likelihood you have heart disease or cancer. In zip codes home to predominantly black and Latinx populations, researchers have noted a distinct lack of so-called auxiliary health care practitioners, ranging from mental health specialists to dentists, which harms the ability of those communities to receive quality health care and manage chronic conditions. Unsurprisingly then, across the United States, rates of asthma, obesity, diabetes, and other cardiovascular risk factors are much higher among black and Latinx individuals than in whites. Right here in Massachusetts, the Boston-Cambridge-Newton area was ranked, by one measure, as the seventh most segregated metropolitan area in the country, with over 40% of the population living in segregated areas. In the low-income communities of color bordering Logan Airport, including Chelsea, Revere, and East Boston, aircraft emissions contaminate homes and schools with a \"harmful air pollution\" that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. AH of these cities, along with Lowell, Brockton and Lawrence, are also \"food deserts,\" areas with limited access to the healthy food that can help regulate weight, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. Higher percentages of cold-related illness, overcrowding and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure are reported in the South End, Rox-bury, Dorchester, East Boston and South Boston. Unsurprisingly then, the racial health gaps in our region are stark. Black and Latinx Boston residents bear a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality from ailments associated with socially determined circumstances, suffering from higher rates of asthma emergency department visits, obesity, hypertension, diabetes hospitalizations and tuberculosis than their white counterparts. Is it any wonder then, that communities of color were so vulnerable to COVID-19, which is most fatal in individuals with asthma, heart conditions, obesity, and diabetes - the very illnesses shaped by our segregated environments? Is it sheer coincidence that the airborne particles polluting communities of color may also be assisting the spread of COVID-19? Is it truly surprising that, from Chelsea to Chicago, people of color across the United States are falling ill and dying from coronavirus at disproportionate rates? When the pandemic subsides, we cannot simply resume life as normal. Instead, we must confront a single, simple truth: Far from being an equalizer, the virus has exposed the vast environmental inequality of American life.

      "body": "FULL TEXT The \"Breathe Life\" murals byProBlak Roxbury native and Boston street art legend ProBlak began his series celebrating black children in 2017 with the \"Breathe Life\" mural at 324 Blue Hill Avenue in Grove Hall. The mural depicts a young boy in a fantastical landscape blowing into a toy house. Last year, ProBlak debuted \"Breathe Life 3\" at 808 Tremont Street, just a few blocks from where he grew up. The mural shows a black brother and sister joyfully playing together against a similarly fantastical backdrop. Both murals are meant to illustrate joy, an emotional more essential than ever during this pandemic. \"999 Cranes\" by Silvia Lopez Chavez This vibrant mural on the side of Ruggles Station depicts two hands holding a paper crane. Around it, geometric shapes like arrows and targets mix with organic floral patterns, all in flat planes of bold color. The intention of the mural is to illustrate that a journey never goes in a straight line. The mural references both physical journeys, like those taken on the nearby Orange Line, and metaphorical journeys. Now, the piece speaks to the current climate, in that the COVID-19 pandemic is full of unknowns, no straight answers or lines, but that community and creativity will allow people to persevere. \"A World of Innocent Wonder\" by Cedric Douglas Hidden within Northeastern University's campus is a mural that perfectly illustrates the possibilities of imagination and creativity. \"A World of Innocent Wonder\" depicts a small child holding a spray paint can. From that can, an energetic splash of hues and shapes emerges, including a dinosaur, a mountain landscape and a burst of primary colors. The mural shows how art and imagination can create a whole world where there was once just a wall, just like Douglas' works do all around the city. While Bostonians are now confined within their walls most of the time, that doesn't have to stop the spread of invention, exploration and artistic joy.

      "body": "FULL TEXT Here, Olayiwola talks with the Banner about celebrating National Poetry Month during this time of physical distancing. Q. How can Bostonians take part in National Poetry Month while staying home? A. I love National Poetry Month. It's a uniting entity for the poetry diaspora, a way for us do some of our work with the rest of world through events that engage folks who don't usually identify themselves as poets. Virtual readings such as the April 17 event can bring people together around poetry and help us cope with this trauma. How are you celebrating National Poetry Month? My goal is to read poems every day for 30 minutes. Li Young Lee, in his poem \"The Undressing,\" is devastating in his word choice, yet it feels so soft. I'm reading fiction too. \"An American Marriage,\" by Tayari Jones, is fantastic. I cry when I read it. National Poetry Month seems like a good time to honor artistic heroes and ancestors. Who are some of yours? Nikki Giovanni's \"Love Poems\" still moves me. Octa-via Butler's 1993 book \"Parable of the Sower\" is so well versed in humans that she writes the future. One of her characters runs for president with the motto \"Make America great again.\" I've been re-reading Toni Morrison as a form of research for her play \"The Bluest Eye.\" And June Jordan's \"A Poem About My Rights\" has great authenticity. She can take something mundane, like taking a walk at night, and what that means as a woman, in a way I can identify with. What are some of the projects you are working on? I've been exploring the link between the black diaspora and water. Two years ago, I visited a slave port in Nigeria. We saw a well that slaves had to drink from, poisoned with a concoction by a conjure man that made them forget their memories during the Middle Passage. Meanwhile, I'm feeling how good it is to be next to my partner and in contact with my friends and colleagues. Love is one of the major power tools we have to get through this. What are you looking forward to doing when this physical distancing is over? Having a picnic in a park. Love is one of the major power tools we have to get through this. - Porsha Olayiwola ON THE WEB Learn more at: www.porshaolayiwola.com The ARTery's Linvingroom livestream: www.wbur.org/artery/2020/D3/3D/artery-living-room-livestream",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Spirit of Emancipation | Harriet Tubman Park, South End | by Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller In this bronze piece at West Newton Street and Columbus Avenue, steps from a sculpture of Harriet Tubman, a man and two women arise from the Tree of Knowledge. The figures stand tall, resolute and strong, a departure from common depictions of emancipation and slavery at the time. This is in large part thanks to the African American sculptor. Fuller was a prominent figure of the Harlem Renaissance movement and she created this sculpture in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. Though the original plaster cast was made in 1913, Boston's bronze version wasn't installed until 1999. Phillis Wheatley | Commonwealth Avenue Mall I by Meredith Bergmann Phillis Wheatley was brought to Boston on a slave ship in 1761 and put to work as a personal servant to the Wheatley family on what is now State Street in the financial district. At the time, she was 8 years old. Wheatley was a talented writer and published her first poem at age 12. Though her life was plagued with trials, slavery first and later poverty and three children who died in infancy, she never stopped putting her thoughts on paper. She became the first African American and first U.S. slave to publish a book of poems, as well as the third American woman to do so. Robert Gould Shaw and Massachusetts 54th Regiment Memorial | Boston Common | by Augustus Saint-Gaudens One of the best-known statues of black history in Boston, the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial pays homage to one of the first African American regiments in the Civil War. The high-relief bronze monument took almost 14 years to complete. It's particularly significant for the way Saint-Gaudens sculpted the faces. Often in group portraits, especially of African Americans, individuality was erased in favor of a nondescript mass. Saint-Gaudens used real people to model the soldiers and gave each face its own unique, individual look. The men are distinguishable as individuals to be honored separately as well as together in the regiment. Though the memorial was under restoration prior to the pandemic and may not be viewable on a socially-distanced walk right now, the piece is featured in a WGBH Forum Network panel discussion about the significance of race and public monuments, available on YouTube.

What attracted me to the job was the chance to practice and participate in the heart of the black and brown community of the city of Boston. The work done today will yield significant benefits in the future, so I wanted to apply my experience to the work being done. The team I work with is passionate about the project. I personally wanted to contribute to the historical legacy. What do you envision happening in Nubian Square in the next 10 years? There are several things I see happening. I see stability, I see growth and a strong business environment that emerges as a diverse cultural destination attracting individuals and families from all across Boston. I also see the state attracting national and international tourism. I would like to see well-paying jobs that offer stability to the community. I also envision a strong night life utilizing places such as Hibernian Hall and other facilities in the district for jazz, soul music, theatrical presentation, steel bands, African and Hispanic music. I'd also like to see casual and semi-formal dining in Nubian Square, spaces for education and learning, family fun destinations that build on the history of Nubian Square. What will it take for Nubian Square to become a thriving business district? It will require a continued focus on creative urban planning that involves the Roxbury community, the city of Boston, the lending institutions in the city and the philanthropic community. We have to start valuing the culture and the ethnic diversity that our community has to offer. The success of Nubian Square is the success of the black and brown community in the city of Boston, which benefits the entire city. What are the challenges Nubian Square is currently facing? The perception of safety. There's still a perception that Nubian Square is unsafe. I would say that during business operating hours the square is just as safe as any other location in Boston. There's also a lack of support from lending institutions investing in the community. A lot of things can get done here. I hope to be a driving force of getting things from point A to point B. What are the district's greatest assets? I think it's its residents, the people who create that rich ethnic background, what I refer to as black and brown Boston. Its location is unique. There are assets that already exist there. There's tremendous opportunity for growth. There are recreational opportunities, arts, music. It's a prideful, hard-working community. It has all the key ingredients to be a successful, thriving business community. \"We have to start valuing the culture and the ethnic diversity that our community has to offer.

The recent videos of police brutality and the pandemic have made it impossible to ignore deep systemic inequities - the death rate for black folks is three times higher than the death rate for white Americans. But I'm also skeptical. Once the news media moves on, will Mayor Walsh and other political leaders still care? Racism in America is a pervasive problem. What we've seen in the last few weeks - horrific recordings of police violence against black folks, and the loud, angry response across the country - that's a bad flare-up. But treating the flare-up alone won't treat the underlying chronic disease. The disease of racism isn't just a white policeman kneeling on a black man's neck. It's black and brown people breathing polluted air. It's black folks in Boston spending 64 more hours stuck on the bus than white folks. It's decades of housing policy that leave the average black family in Boston with $8 in wealth while the average white family has $247,500. To really treat this chronic illness, we have to go to the core, heal the original wounds, and repair the damage it has done to our systems. That means looking closely at how we ended up with such deep inequity. It means calling into question long-held ways of making decisions, like rethinking the way police do their job, reconsidering the way we \"redevelop\" neighborhoods and force longtime residents out, doing more to redress environmental injustice like unhealthy air and unequal transit and lack of green space for black and brown Bos-tonians. At ACE, we're dedicated to this fight and rooted in the historic black heart of Boston, Roxbury's Nubian Square. We're fighting for transit justice. For environmental justice, reduced pollution and cleaner water and more access to green space. We're fighting for housing justice and ending displacement. We're working with our youth program REEP (Roxbury Environmental Empowerment Program) to fight for better employment opportunities, better training, justice in our education system. In the short-term, we're asking that when the BPDA permits developers in key Nubian Square areas of Crescent Parcel, the Malcolm X Parcel, the Putnam Parcel and Parcel 3, they commit to passive house and LEED Platinum buildings, as well as traffic flows to increase walking and reduce vehicle air pollution. We're also asking that as the MBTA decides how and when to fully relaunch bus service, they look at the impact on black and brown and immigrant communities first. Our communities are hardest-hit by COVID-19, the most reliant on the bus, and the most in danger of contagion on crowded buses. So let's keep fighting the flare-up. I welcome Mayor Walsh's leadership as we use the energy of this moment to fight police violence against our communities. But let's also use some of this momentum for the long-term fight. Racism is a chronic disease and we have to be in this fight for the long haul.

      "body": "FULL TEXT The Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists in Roxbury continued its annual tradition of recognizing Juneteenth, this year with a Face-book Live event including music performances, a reading of the Emancipation Proclamation and recognition of community members. Museum director Edmund Barry Gaither discussed the history of the celebration and some of the milestones made in the black community throughout the year, including the renaming of Dudley Square to Nubian Square. Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley also made an appearance. \"We come together in the face of crises within crises, of trauma layered upon trauma,\" she said. \"...Yet despite all the entrenched barriers placed in our path, we are resilient, we are vibrant, we are determined and we are proud. I remain clear in my conviction and emboldened in my faith because of all of you.\" Other black-run arts organizations like Castle of Our Skins also took to the internet to rally community on Juneteenth. The performance organization dedicated to celebrating black ancestry through music streamed an original composition called \"Hannah Elias II,\" by composer and viola soloist Shannon Sea. Front Porch Arts Collective, a theater company dedicated to telling black stories and uplifting black talent, hosted a dance party, a workout class and a safe refuge space for black artist to regroup in. The Museum of Fine Arts, in collaboration with BAMS Fest, put its eighth annual Juneteenth celebration in the hands of Boston's black artists for panels, readings, artist talks and live artmaking. Chanel Thervil led an artmaking event inspired by Roberto Lugo's piece \"Law and Order: The Reincarnation of Frederick Douglass.\" Lugo later gave a talk about the piece, a porcelain pot painted with images of the black experience. The coming together of so many different arts organizations on Juneteenth was an important and powerful experience. But its joy was accompanied by the knowledge that there is still a lot of work to be done. \"If you read the Emancipation Proclamation, you realize that this was no easy battle, and the victory came in fits and starts. Kind of like today, where we're still struggling for certain kinds of rights and recognitions,\" artist and children's book illustrator Ekua Holmes commented after her reading from \"Black is a Rainbow Color\" by Angela Joy. \"But I feel like celebrating every victory that we've achieved as a country and a people is worth doing.\" ON THE WEB Watch the MFA's Juneteenth celebration online at: mfa.org/event/community-celebra-tions/juneteenth?event=3253",

      "body": "FULL TEXT Heckstall hails from Middle-town, Conn, and attended Trinity College in Hartford, where he earned a batchelor's degree in education with a concentration in neuroscience. He found that his work tutoring and helping to lead an afterschool program sparked a passion for education, specifically working with students in under-served communities. Heckstall began working for Citizen Schools, working with middle school students in Dorchester to provide mentorship and real-world learning experiences. While completing his master's in education from Lesley University, Heckstall became a Teach For America corps member and worked as a science and special education teacher at what is now the Dearborn STEM Academy. Heckstall remained working in schools as a teacher, a Dean of Students and finally his most recent school-based role as co-principal of the 9th Grade Academy of Lawrence High School in Lawrence, Mass. Heckstall joined Teach For America's staff in the summer of 2018, leading the direct support and development of the current corps members in the region. In this role, Heckstall supervised the region's school-based coaches and supported program management as the managing director of Teacher Leadership Development.",

      "body": "FULL TEXT \"Based on the history of the fabrics, I wanted to actually evoke that connection between Asia, Africa and Europe - and of course the diaspora in the United States,\" says Shonibare. Dutch traders brought batik prints, an Indonesian textile, to African markets in the 19th century. The African batik that's a familiar print today stems from those exchanges. Greenway Public Art Curator Lucas Cowan says this cross-cultural theme is particularly poignant on the Greenway, which is situated between two immigrant-built neighborhoods, the North End and Chinatown. Shonibare's piece joins Mexican-American folk artist Catalina Delga-do-Trunk's \"Global Connections: Mesoamerican Myths, the Domestication of Nourishment and its Distribution\" by and \"A Mouse with Ears and Tail\" by local artist Furen Dai. The collection makes for its own artistic melting pot on the shores of the Boston Harbor. \"Each of these artists really interprets their histories or their connections to an immigrant experience and to their culture in very different ways,\" says Cowan. \"Just to be able to say, 'That's somebody like me' is extremely important.\" \"Wind Sculpture (SG) V\" winds around itself, flashing the bright batik pattern in shades of tangerine, maroon and turquoise. Shonibare says he uses the traditional batik process to make the prints but that the shapes are abstract images of his own creation, a blending of old and new. Accessibility is also a key part of the art experience. Shonibare came and visited the Greenway prior to making the piece and was moved by the way it acted as a meeting ground in bustling Downtown Boston, a democratic place of gathering and art appreciation. The truly spectacular nature of the sculpture is the visual lightness of it. The artist's vision of a piece of fabric twisting and billowing in the wind is perfectly rendered despite the heavy fiberglass body of the sculpture. One of the themes in Shonibare's work is that of untruth and imagination in art, and here that is the illusion of lightness where there really lies strength. \"The works also challenge the history of monuments, in the sense that they are grounded, they come out of the ground and they're not on a high pedestal,\" says Shonibare. \"They're more or less evolving on the same level as the audience.\" In a way, \"Wind Sculpture (SG) V\" is an ideal picture of equality, a bright, hopeful artwork that's made for and accessible to everyone. Based on the history of the fabrics, I wanted to actually evoke that connection between Asia, Africa and Europe - and of course the diaspora in the United States.\" -Yinka Shonibare ON THE WEB Learn more about the sculpture at: rosekennedygreenway.org/windsculpture | Learn more about Yinka Shonibare: yinkashonibare.com/home",

The group blends Afro-Cuban, Puerto Rican and Yoruban music styles with an electronica base and sings in Spanish, English and Yoruba. IFE performed classic hits from their repertoire as well as preview tracks from their sophomore album debuting this fall. This year, the series will have a special focus on Puerto Rican and Afro-Caribbean artists and music to celebrate the island roots of many of Villa Victoria's residents and to support Black artists during the ongoing fight for racial justice. On July 23, Henry Cole, a celebrated percussionist in the Afro-Puerto Rican jazz movement, will perform a tribute to series' namesake Tito Puente. On July 30, Mahya will perform a concert of her unique Antillean rhythms. Though the series won't include the in-person community-building and joyous dancing that's usually found at O'Day Playground, there are benefits to an online platform. The concerts are saved on the IBA Facebook page so music lovers can re-watch and re-live them as many times as desired. The global platform also allows viewers from all over the world to participate and performers who may not otherwise have been able to fly to Boston to spread their sound. During the July 17 concert, viewers from Texas, Colombia, New York City and the Greater Boston area all chimed in to express their excitement about the series. \"Those of you who know me know I'm going crazy in my [living room] right about now,\" Darryl Robinson from Boston commented. \"I'm always happy when I'm dancing.\" Mission accomplished.

She provides opportunity and job training for her workers, who lack education and English communication skills. Shaikh was born in a small village in rural Gujarat, India. Her family owned a chicken farm, which was their primary source of income, but there was barely enough profit to sustain a living. With financial troubles and lack of resources, Shaikh never had access to proper education and, because her siblings were too young to help, she had to work on the farm with her parents. Her family saw the chance to migrate to America as an opportunity to escape their uncertain and hard life in India, and in 1998, when Shaikh was 12, they moved to Boston. \"Basically, people who come from our culture, like the women, are not supposed to work,\" Shaikh said. \"They just take care of the house, as being a homemaker is their responsibility.\" Shaikh belongs to the Guja-rati-Muslim community which happens to be a minority both in India and America. In India, it's a Muslim community in the large and predominantly Hindu state of Gujrat. According to Shaikh, being a woman in a minority religious community is equivalent to being a sub-minority, as expected societal ideals are very conservative, especially when it comes to women and gender roles. Shaikh's father passed away shortly after the family's arrival in America and Shaikh had to take on responsibility for her mother and two siblings. \"My mom never had been working,\" she said. \"So, I'm the first person in my house who actually obtained a job at the earliest age possible.\" Despite continuing to face financial barriers in America, worsened by communication difficulties, Shaikh's school teachers encouraged her to pursue her dreams. \"My English was less, but there were these teachers in my school who helped me when I was struggling and that created the opportunity for me,\" said Shaikh. Now, she has a Bachelor's degree in medical laboratory technology from UMass Lowell, and is licensed to practice. \"Sometimes it just takes one person to do a little help, and that small help can change someone's life,\" she said. In 2015, when her partner wanted to start a business, they purchased the restaurant Guru the Caterer. The employees of the restaurant were all female immigrants from India. After taking over the business, Shaikh oversaw the staff and kitchen. She became a part of these women's lives and realized that most of them could not speak English or did not have any qualifications. For these workers their job at the restaurant was their only source of income. \"I realized there was no security for these women. They were working at my restaurant, but in case I did not own it, and did not want to keep them hired they would have just lost their livelihood,\" she said. Inspired by her own life experiences, Shaikh decided to help. She started training her workers by teaching them English and also about the health regulations required by the restaurant industry. Shaikh also helped out her staff with their federal forms and applications for health insurance and other official procedures that are often mostly in English. She got all her workers certified in ServSafe\u00e2\u201d\u00ac\u00d0\u00be a food and beverage safety training, a certificate program administered by the U.S. National Restaurant Association. Shaikh hires many people who require a job, regardless of their nationality. She said many of her friends or co-workers often send people to her who are looking for jobs. These people are usually new immigrants, people too afraid to get a job because of their language consciousness or lack of qualifications. She said her agenda is not just helping immigrants, but all people who struggle due to something like a language barrier. \"I hire people who don't get hired by others,\" she said. With the closure of the farmers market in spring, Shaikh is busy with her catering service, which she's been operating from her restaurant at Somerville. She plans to expand her restaurant and catering service in the future. \"I know how hard it is to start a new life. And if I can help them in that journey, I can make a difference and that's all that matters.\" Shaikh said. Shaikh and her staff at Guru the Caterer have, like many non-essential businesses in Boston, had to adapt during the coronavirus pandemic. They have already provided paid leave for older workers and those with a long commute. Only staff that live near the restaurant are working, and Shaikh herself is making the no-contact deliveries from their Somerville location. Customers can order and pay online through delivery apps like Grubhub, or through the restaurant's website.

And if I can help them in that journey, I can make a difference and that's all that matters.\" -Mehzabin MitzyShaikhn",
