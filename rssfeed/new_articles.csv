It’s become an annual event: as the turtles get stuck trying to migrate to warmer waters in the south, volunteers find the stunned turtles and bring them here, to the New England Aquarium’s Sea Turtle Hospital in Quincy.“So, we're checking blood,” Tuxbury said as she continued her examination. “We can tell this guy's a little dehydrated. The eyes are sunken, but we're pretty active on the table, which is great.”This is one of 59 turtles rehabbed here that were flown to Florida on Tuesday, where they will ultimately be released into warmer Atlantic waters. Kemp’s ridleys are the smallest sea turtles in the world, and they’re critically endangered. On Monday, there were 144 sea turtles at the hospital, including green sea turtles and much larger loggerheads.“In a perfect world, they would have gone south once that cold weather hits,” said Adam Kennedy, the hospital’s director. “But unfortunately, due to the shape of Massachusetts, when they head south, they run into the landmass.”That landmass is the long, upward-curving arm of Cape Cod. It doesn’t occur to the turtles to swim north to get around the Cape so they just get stuck in the bay as the temperatures drop.“And unfortunately, the water gets too cold for them,” Kennedy said. “They kind of shut down a little bit. They float to the top of the water and there they kind of wait for the weather to warm up.”But of course, the weather doesn't warm up until spring, and the wind ends up pushing the floating turtles onto the beach.Kennedy says this didn’t used to happen nearly as often, but the climate is changing and raising the water temperatures around Cape Cod.“Normally, those waters that would have been cold would have kept the majority of turtles out of Cape Cod Bay,” he said. “About 15 to 20 years ago, we would see 30 to 40 turtles per year. We're now, you know, on average, about 400 turtles coming in. And because now what's happening is the warm water is kind of keeping that cold water pushed north for a lot longer, allowing a lot more turtles to funnel into Cape Cod Bay than what they would have been able to years ago.”The hospital is in a warehouse on the Quincy waterfront, with four huge tanks holding up to 15,000 gallons of water. On this day, there are fewer turtles than usual because recent winds haven’t been strong enough to push more of them onto the beach.In addition to medical care, the turtles get a carefully prepared diet, like a feast of squid and herring prepared by intern Emily Davis.“We'll cut it into filets because the turtles right now aren't eating any hard parts,” she said. “We cut into filets so they have nice boneless pieces.”Some of the turtles that arrive here are in pretty rough shape, but Kennedy said the hospital is able to save up to 80% of those that make it here.Biologist Alessia Brugnara examined another one of the Kemp’s ridley turtles and wanted to give it some antibiotic eye drops. But the turtle wouldn’t open its eyes.“Honestly, if he doesn't open his eyes all the way, we'll just make sure to note it,” Brugnara said to a veterinarian assistant who was helping her. “Also, try to administer it because some could get between the eyelids. But this is actually how this turtle has been presenting. He probably has one of the worst eye situations.”Brugnara said turtles that are stunned by the cold can injure their eyes when waves push them into rocks, or they can get frostbite on their eyelids.She said the work is not easy, but the medical team working on this little turtle was hopeful about getting him back in the ocean someday.","Article","Local sea turtle hospital races to save those that wash up on the Cape"

""Historically negotiating these contracts has been about compensation and compensation alone,"" Wu said at a press briefing on Tuesday. ""But because of the many voices we all listened to throughout this process, the city, the department and the [Boston Police Patrolmen's Association] took a different approach, recognizing the potential for bargaining to serve as a tool to deliver the highest standards of community policing anywhere in the nation, while securing resources for the health and well-being of officers and their families."" The deal marks the end of 18 months of negotiations. Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association President Larry Calderone said the contract was overwhelmingly ratified by union membership. ""This is a contract that is fair and equitable to the men and women in uniform that are answering those calls for service,"" Calderone said.The contract is estimated to total $82.3 million, which would be a 21% increase over its five-year period, which retroactively begins in July of 2020. That includes annual pay increases and cost of living adjustments. The contract’s long-awaited resolution spurred a sense of relief, if at times halfhearted, among some reform advocates and law enforcement groups. “We, at [the Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers], commend Mayor Wu for championing this landmark contract and the BPPA for their commitment towards reform and advocacy for the law enforcement workforce,” said Jeffrey S. Lopes, the group’s president. “Mayor Wu’s efforts, and the contract itself, speak volumes both about her commitment to safe communities, and her visionary approach to developing a much needed inclusive recruitment and retention strategy for a department in need of more officers and more diversity.” Wu said the operational reforms in the contract make it unlike any the city has reached with police before. ""Our highest priority is and always will be our residents safety,"" Wu said. ""And we must hold all we entrust with that responsibility to the highest of standards."" That's why, she said, the new contract ""eliminates the pathway to overturn disciplinary action or termination through arbitration"" if an officer is found to have committed one of several serious offenses. Those include rape, kidnapping, attempted murder, use of firearms while committing a felony and a range of violent acts against children. Officers could be fired without arbitration if they were indicted for one of those crimes, or if a sustained internal affairs finding upheld allegations. ""There should be no loophole for those who commit grave criminal acts to wear a badge,"" Wu said. ""And this also just gives that predictability so that the process doesn't drag on and on with arbitration."" Wu cited the case of former BPD union head Patrick Rose, who was convicted of child rape, saying arbitration in cases like that delay resolution. ""That gives me hope,"" said community activist Jamarhl Crawford, who served on a city task force focused on police reform. ""During the Boston Police Reform Task force, I was pushing for what I called a zero-tolerance policy on certain offenses, much like these."" Crawford noted, though, that the list of crimes he wanted to see excluded from arbitration also included domestic violence and drunk driving, which were not included in the contract agreement. He also raised concerns about how rarely the BPD's internal affairs process sustains complaints against officers. The new contact says disagreements over eligibility for medical leave will now be settled by an independent medical examiner, rather than an arbitration process, and includes salary adjustments for officers who participate in continuing education — as well as expanding the universities that qualify, to include the University of Massachusetts System, Northeastern University and Boston University.The contract also reforms how the city handles paid police details.“Currently, 40% of all details go unfilled,” Wu said. “And the highest priority details have serious impacts on safety and traffic flow, but often go unfilled and are compensated at the same rate as any other detail on a quiet residential side street. This has resulted in many of these unfilled, high-priority detail shifts covered by mandated overtime at significant cost to the department, the city, and the taxpayers.”The contract creates a separate designation of high-priority details that must be filled first and will be compensated at a higher hourly rate. It also expands the personnel who can fill those details. Boston police will have the first choice, and unfilled details can be filled by BPD retirees, Boston Housing Authority police officers, university police officers, Boston Municipal Protective Services officers and civilian contract personnel. For Crawford, that raised concerns about equitable awarding of those potentially lucrative private contracts. “I think it would be very difficult for a person of color — Black or Latino, from the very same inner city communities that would be patrolled — to be able to start that business and compete fairly with other high-pocketed, maybe well-connected former law enforcement personnel,” Crawford said. “I think that could create an uneven playing field.” Among the local companies offering private security services is one run by former BPD Commissioner Ed Davis. Crawford likened the competition for those contracts to what he’s observed in the market for police body cameras. “We don't see a bunch of startup companies in that industry,” Crawford said. “It's pretty much been monopolized by the same forces that have monopolized the tech industry as a whole. And those are primarily white and male.”","Article","Boston police union agrees to new contract, including some reforms"

That investigator was not going to be present for Tuesday's hearing.Another investigation into O'Brien's leadership of the commission, focused on public comments she made about the employment status of CCC Executive Director Shawn Collins, has not been completed and was not going to be a focus of Tuesday's proceedings.In ordering the delay, though, Squires-Lee said that the second investigation should be concluded before any hearing takes place, since its findings could overlap with or even contradict the results of the first investigation.State law allows the removal of CCC commissioners if certain conditions are met, but also requires that they be given an ""opportunity to be heard"" before that occurs.The September suspension of O'Brien, who was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002, has ramped up calls for increased scrutiny of the CCC on Beacon Hill, where some legislators say a multitude of issues at the commission merit closer examination.Attorneys for Goldberg and O'Brien are due back in court in ten days.","Article","Judge postpones day of reckoning for suspended cannabis commission chair O'Brien"

Will clouds bring in snow or rain? If so, will it be a sprinkling or a barrage of precipitation?But some of the data used to come up with your local forecast comes from thousands of miles away, GBH meteorologist Dave Epstein said.They’re called teleconnection patterns, “longer and bigger things in the atmosphere that help us to forecast more weekly and seasonal weather,” he said.Teleconnections include El Niño, the Indian Ocean Dipole, North Atlantic Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation and others.For instance: This year is an El Niño year, meaning ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific are unusually warm. That anomaly can shape the weather in New England.“El Niño connects with kind of the global atmosphere and changes it over the course of each season,” he said.Not every bit of weather we feel is necessarily a result of El Niño, he said. But different teleconnections, taken together on a global scale, can shape the weather we experience.“All of these things, think of them like little switches, like light switches,” Epstein said. “Some of them put pressure for us to be colder, warmer, wetter, drier than average here in the northeast, but also all around the globe. And they're all interacting with each other.”Think back to the winter of 2014-15. Boston got about 104 inches of snow that winter, with local weather patterns getting bolstered by global phenomena.Say a nor’easter is approaching, Epstein said. He takes a look at different teleconnections: If the North Atlantic Oscillation is in its negative phase, as is the Arctic Oscillation, but the Pacific North American pattern is in a positive phase, his forecast may call for more snow that it would were all those factors reversed.“That storm may, because it's coming in that pattern, kind of have a little more oomph to it,” he said. “It's kind of in the background, adding a little bit of pressure to make us a little snowier. Like in 2014-15, all those levers were pointed in a certain direction and we know what happened.”","Article","Ask Dave Epstein: What do teleconnections tell us about the local forecast?"

Packaging materials, decorations, food waste and unwanted gifts all add up.Janet Domenitz, the executive director of environmental advocacy group MASSPIRG, says reducing waste is about getting back to the basics and finding simple, creative ways to reduce your consumption across the board, especially when it comes to gifting.“We are bombarded with messages about purchasing new things being synonymous with the joy and giving season of the holidays,” she said. “We just need to break through that.” You can help. From finding the perfect gift to cleaning up after the holidays, there are plenty of ways to cut back on waste this season.Ditch the wrapping paper, or reuse what you already haveThe rules vary city to city, but in Boston, most wrapping paper and bows are not recyclable. That’s why it’s important to cut down on wrapping waste from the start.Reduce: Domenitz said she looks at what she already has that could be repurposed as wrapping material, like magazine pages. She's wrapped gifts for sports fans with the sports section of a newspaper, and wrapped kitchen-related gifts in a towel.“Just look around the house, you have something to wrap a gift in,” Domenitz said.Reuse: There’s a growing U.S. market for gift wrap that’s made specifically for multiple uses.One local option is Rapt, which sells double-sided fabric inspired by Japanese wrapping tradition of furoshiki.“You turn [the cloth] on a diagonal. It’s a reflection of a change of mindset,” said Monica O’Neil, who co-founded the Belmont-based sustainable gift wrap company with her friend Cindy Este. “When you see it, you can’t believe we haven’t been doing it forever.”Rapt sources deadstock material from fabric companies in California and on Long Island.The first question customers ask her about the product? If they can take it back after giving a gift away.“That’s the second present: you’re going to reuse it,” O’Neil said. “Our vision is that this will be in circulation. It’s going to circulate among friend groups, among families.”Recycle: What if you receive a gift in traditional wrapping paper or a gift bag? In those cases, check with your city or town before tossing it in the bin. Most municipalities' websites have a quick search tool for exactly this purpose.Compost your Christmas tree, or regift it to farm animalsMore than 200 Massachusetts cities and towns provide options to recycle your Christmas tree, often through curbside pickup or a central drop-off location, where they are then chipped into mulch and used for municipal landscaping projects, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection.Several local farms also accept tree donations, which they use to feed their goats and sheep. Unity Farm Sanctuary in Sherborn is one of them, and co-founder Kathy Halamka says the gifted trees are great for the animals.“It’s a distraction, a treat and a dewormer,"" she said. “Vitamin C, vitamin A, all kinds of good stuff.”Some big box stores that ship trees nationally use fire retardants and other additives, Halamka said, which can be dangerous for the animals. She says organic trees are best for donations, along with those sold at local farm stands.After the animals have eaten, Unity Farm Sanctuary also grinds up the tree scraps and uses the mulch for walking trails on the property.“It’s a sustainable operation that makes sense,"" Halamka said.Shop smart and donate unneeded foodFood is a huge contributor to everyday household waste. The EPA recommends assessing your cupboards and refrigerator before you make your shopping list to avoid unneeded purchases, eating your leftovers and using your freezer to preserve excess dishes.If you end up with unopened and unwanted ingredients, you can take it to your local community fridge. These volunteer-run pantries and fridges are seeing increased demand at this time of year, so your food will go somewhere it's needed instead of sitting forever on a shelf.Your local food pantry may also accept donations, but it's important to check what they will take before planning a drop-off.Choose gifts with sustainability in mindBefore you think about wrapping and holiday cleanup, sustainability starts with the gifts you buy, Domenitz said. She suggested shopping first at thrift stores, which often reinvest profits back into the communities they operate in. She also recommended participating in your local ""Buy Nothing Group"" on Facebook, where members offer up items they don't need anymore for free.MASSPIRG suggests gifting services instead of new goods — like a tuneup for a bike your friend already owns — or upcycling things that would otherwise be thrown away. “There are so many ways to share gifts and generosity during the holidays,” Domenitz said.","Article","How to reduce waste during the holidays"

She didn’t have stable housing or a job, and was weighed down by a lengthy criminal record.“As a woman, the first thing you’re thinking about [when you leave prison] is: how do you get to your kids?” she told GBH News recently. “You can’t just go home and get your child.”On that chilly morning, Hinson became one of nearly 500 releases of incarcerated women from Massachusetts state prisons last year, almost all of them from the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Framingham, the state’s only women’s prison. That doesn't include women released from county jail or federal prison. While far more men are released from the state’s prisons and jails each year, researchers say women face specific and complex challenges that make them especially vulnerable. Studies show, when they enter prison, women are even more likely than men to struggle with drug abuse, psychiatric disorders, poverty and trauma. And their successes and failures can have more direct impact on children who rely on them. Women leaving carceral settings are more likely to be the sole caretakers of their children — roughly 60 to 80% of women have minor children, and women are five times more likely than men to have children in foster care or a state agency. Yet there is limited effort from the state or local organizations to help formerly incarcerated women overcome these challenges, an investigation from GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting has found. A dozen formerly incarcerated women told GBH News about their struggles to find housing, jobs and education while dealing with long-term trauma and other challenges caused by their criminal records. Many said they faced domestic and sexual violence before their sentences, and assault during prison. Upon release, they said they received little institutional support, instead relying on cash-strapped nonprofits, or no one at all. Challenges are even more daunting for women with children. Hinson was one of the few willing to talk about the struggles of getting her children back — a goal she says is more often at the forefront for formerly incarcerated women. “[Men] might want to go see their kid, but they’re not thinking about walking into a courthouse after they just were released and trying to go get their kid or even ask for visitation,” she said. “I had to prove to you why my kids should be with me.” The state Department of Correction says it has a series of programs for women at MCI-Framingham, where women serving longer sentences are housed among detainees awaiting a court hearing. State prison officials pointed to its program description booklet, which mentions a “Female Offender Program Continuum” and a handful of other women-specific efforts. Programs like “Family preservation,” “Parenting Inside Out,” “Parenting Support Group,” “DCF Visit Coordination” and “Parents Helping Parents” are mentioned, as well as another held annually called ""Mommy and Me.""Jason Dobson, a DOC spokesman, said that program provides space “for incarcerated parents to restore and foster relationships with their children that will continue to build over time and beyond MCI-Framingham.” There have been some advancements in help for women heading home. There is the state prison system’s Credible Messengers, a voluntary mentorship program with seven staff that offers help to state prisoners expected to be released within 90 to 120 days. So far, the program has supported 317 people — 71 of them women — since its launch in 2021, state officials say. A local nonprofit recently created a home for formerly incarcerated women in Boston. And, last year, another Boston-based nonprofit called Justice 4 Housing launched a program called Stable Housing and Reintegration Program, or SHARP, meant to provide housing vouchers, case management and support services for justice-involved women and men. Leslie Credle, executive director of Justice 4 Housing, says the group has helped 29 women and 45 men so far. But she says there’s far fewer programs in the state to help women, especially to find housing that can unite them with their children.“Women tend to have children and families versus men who have families usually who support them,” Credle said. “Women usually don’t have that. They are usually the primary caretaker.”Getting homeWhen Hinson left prison in October, she was determined not to go back.Formerly incarcerated women return to state prison after committing new crimes at largely the same rate as men — about 30% of the cohort who were released in 2018, according to state data.Hinson attributes her criminal history to a turbulent childhood. She calls herself a “state’s kid” — moving through 16 foster homes before aging out as an adult.Long struggling with addiction, she says she got sober after the father of her children died of an overdose. At the age of 41, she says she needs to make up for lost time.Nearly 1.5 million children have a parent in state or federal prison, according to government estimates. Hinson doesn’t want her children to continue to be part of that statistic.“I have no other chances,” she said. “They don’t have anybody other than me.” Hinson told her story to GBH News recently in Dorchester, dressed simply in a white T-shirt and cut-offs, her hair pulled back tightly in a bun.The day Hinson left MCI-Framingham, she says she was met by her nephew, her brother-in-law and her two adult children, now 23 and 19. The younger two, now ages 15 and 10, couldn’t be there because they were in school.Hinson said she kept in touch with her children during the three-and-a-half years behind bars. But she’s still working to gain their trust — especially the older ones. “They’ve also been dragged through the mud longer,” she said.In some ways, Hinson has been fortunate. While serving her latest sentence in Framingham, she was introduced to the Credible Messengers program that provided her a mentor. That mentor connected her to Justice 4 Housing, which hosts the 18-month Stable Housing and Reintegration Program.Credle, the head of Justice 4 Housing, says she created the program a year after being released from federal prison in 2018 after seeing so many formerly incarcerated women with nowhere to go. The program requires that interested people, mostly people recently released from prison or jail, take financial literacy classes, trauma counseling and work with a case manager if they’re selected for housing. To get that opportunity, they’re entered into a lottery to obtain a housing voucher through a partnership with the Boston Housing Authority to help with the rent. Other municipalities are beginning to partner with the group for additional vouchers. Justice 4 Housing covers the rest of rent and other housing costs.Hinson says she first learned about the SHARP program two months after her release. At first she was skeptical — she’d left carceral settings before with nowhere to go, and was at a homeless shelter before her last incarceration. “I said, ‘Don’t waste your time. Don’t waste my time. I’ve tried to get housing before I was ever a convicted felon,’” she said. “Because I had minor court cases, misdemeanors, they wouldn't allow me to receive housing.”Finding stable, not just temporary, housing can be a struggle for formerly incarcerated individuals, according to a 2015 study from Harvard Kennedy School.Meeting the program’s obligations were challenging, Hinson said — attending appointments, filing paperwork and getting to court hearings, all without a car. She sometimes had no other choice but to stay with people actively using drugs, she said, at one point, forced to move after a friend overdosed.She said her children were staying with family while she was incarcerated. She feels lucky because no one contested her efforts to seek their return. She had one hearing with the Barnstable family court for one child, and another with a Manchester, N.H., court for her son, who was living out of state.“I missed a lot — they’ve gone through a lot,” she said.Six months after she started the program, Hinson says she was approved to move into a three-bedroom apartment in Dorchester with her two youngest children.Many other families aren’t as fortunate. Gelissa Cruz, 35, wasn't able to find a place to live with her 13-year-old son who is currently living with his grandmother.Cruz says she spent three years in the Suffolk County House of Correction for driving under the influence. In April, she was paroled to the McGrath House, a residential reentry program for women in the South End run by the nonprofit Community Resources for Justice.She said the home was a “pretty good stepping stone,” where she was able to get back on her feel. After that, she says she moved in with her mother. But she says she’s struggled to find housing that would accommodate her and her son, a challenge complicated by the fact that she has physical and mental health disabilities in addition to her criminal record. It took Cruz many months and several waiting lists with local housing authorities to get a home with the help of advocacy from Justice 4 Housing. But her son is still with his grandmother. She says not living with her son is a “hardship” — but she is grateful he is is well taken care of and she can see him when she wants. “Now that he's going to a good school near the grandmother's house, I kind of am OK with that,” she said.‘A lot of beds are for men’It’s not just formerly incarcerated women with children who struggle to find a place to live in Massachusetts, with one of the highest costs of housing in the country.When Stacey Borden was incarcerated at MCI-Framingham from 2006 to 2010, she imagined the floor plan of a home where people like her could live after prison.After her release, Borden set out to make her dream a reality. She obtained a bachelor’s degree in human services and a master’s degree in mental health counseling, focusing on trauma and addiction. After graduating in 2016, Borden founded New Beginnings Reentry Services, intent on helping other women.“Coming out of prison really has been a lack of resources. We know that it’s a struggle to get women into treatment,” she said. “A lot of beds are for men.”Last year, Borden celebrated the opening of her program, a beautiful red three-story home for women returning from prison. The house — with three bedrooms, office space and a top floor “boutique” with donated clothes — has seven round-the-clock staff. There are currently eight women living there.“We’re dealing with the trauma, making sure that they’re feeling safe, build their confidence, so they can go out in the community without causing any harm and know that they can live their lives in society productively,” she said.LaTonya Brown Seymour, 53, says the stable housing and structure are helping her succeed. A survivor of domestic abuse, Brown Seymour says she was released in 2018 from a South Carolina prison. Originally from Massachusetts, Brown Seymour says her brother, who is serving time in prison, connected her to New Beginnings for help fleeing another abusive relationship.“For the longest time when I first got here, I wasn’t feeling safe because he was still looking for me,” she said. “But then I was able to find a job where I can work from home and start doing better for myself and staying focused.”With the security and stability, Brown Seymour has bigger ambitions. She hopes to attend Roxbury Community College to obtain a criminal justice degree — and eventually buy her own home.Borden says her optimism is widespread. Since the home run by New Beginnings opened last year, only one woman has been sent back to prison or jail. Several have moved to their own apartments.Borden is proud of her organization and hopes to see it replicated. With more women in power in local government, Borden is hopeful for change. She believes that once a woman has stable housing, they need to pause before finding work. “We need to get our minds in order,” she said. “We need to deal with the trauma that took us into the prison in the first place.”But Borden’s program doesn’t provide housing for mothers with their children. Among challenges, she says, are zoning requirements to house children. Still, Borden says her program works hard to help women reunify with children, if possible, and help them find a home. Part of what contributes to their success, she says, is the space is solely focusing on women’s needs.“The home cannot accommodate children because it is uniquely designed for women's empowerment,” she said. GBH News couldn't find a single reentry service that houses families of women with children under one roof. The McGrath House — where Cruz stayed — provides 33 beds for women, some of whom are there as part of their reentry plan on parole or probation. The house is run by the nonprofit Community Resources for Justice that also runs other reentry centers, with six beds for women in New Bedford and 30 beds for both men and women in Western Massachusetts. Yet not all the beds for women are full. The organization believes its services are underutilized because access to women in prison was stalled since the beginning of the pandemic. Megan Piccirillo, a spokeswoman for Community Resources for Justice, also says some women stay away because they feel they need to immediately get back to their children. “We’ve seen time and time again that incarcerated women face family pressure when they are released,” she said. “They feel an obligation to resume caretaking and bring home income for their family.”Making it workHinson said it took her almost a year from her release from prison to get a part-time job, hindered by lack of experience and a criminal record. She now holds a job focused on helping formerly incarcerated people clean up Melnea Cass Boulevard, a troubled Boston area known for its tent encampments occupied by those struggling with drug addiction and lack of housing.She is grateful for the work. Some days she’s picking up trash and landscaping; other days she’s helping an unhoused person access a storage locker to pick up their things. “I’m helping somebody no matter what,” she said. “It's good for someone like me that did get out of prison that's trying to learn how to work and be out here.”Finding work is tough for most people returning from prison. But Arthur Bembury, executive director of Partakers, a Newton-based nonprofit focused on education for returning citizens, says the process is particularly hard for women because they’re often the main caregiver. Bembury sees women in his program often on parole, working two low-paid jobs, trying to find a decent apartment, a car, fighting custody battles, all while going through an education program to improve their job prospects.“There is a discernible difference in the challenges that they face coming home versus men,” Bembury said. “They’re walking on a tightrope, like they can’t make a mistake.”In June, Hinson moved into her Dorchester home with custody of her two youngest children. Justice 4 Housing helped her find furniture; she’s qualified for food assistance for groceries. She’s determined to make it work.“I remind them all the time, like: Listen, I’m here now, OK?” she said. “This was going to happen because of who I am. You were never going somewhere without me following you.”","Article","Women coming home from prison get little help rebuilding"

Joan Donovan claims in her complaint, filed with the Massachusetts attorney general and the U.S. Department of Education, that her main project was gutted after Harvard received a record $500 million donation from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in late 2021, a foundation run by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. Donovan, who now works for Boston University, was leading Harvard’s Technology and Social Change Research Project and primarily focused on misinformation on social media. “I was duped, in many ways, into believing that I would be protected because I was at Harvard,” Donovan told GBH News. “I never imagined I would need protection from Harvard to do my research.” Donovan says, at Harvard, she had been working on a project that would make the Facebook Papers public domain.The trove of internal company documents were disclosed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2021 by a former Facebook employee. They reportedly show that the social media platform internally kept track of real-world problems that it had itself created and propagated, and that the tech company had ignored warnings from its own employees about risks. Donovan said she received the papers lawfully and that she felt she had a duty to publicize them.“Facebook has set up a series of research engagements where Facebook, by contract, has the right to kill these projects before they get published,” she said. “There is a serious problem in the field of internet studies where Facebook themselves are picking the research agenda about them — and they're also picking who gets to do research and who gets access.”According to the complaint, Donovan claims that leaders at the Kennedy School “were inappropriately influenced by Meta/Facebook.”During a Zoom meeting with the school’s main donor in October 2021, Donovan discussed the leaked papers and how Meta knew it was causing harm.Donovan said that in that meeting, former Facebook communications executive Elliot Schrage behaved erratically and, according to the complaint, told her that she didn’t understand the papers.Almost two weeks later, Donovan said she slowly began losing her academic freedom as the dean kept adding restrictions to her research.“I wasn't allowed to hire. I wasn't allowed to have a conference related to public interest issues in internet communications,” she said. “I was blocked from having a podcast — and the dean said that he was most notably not going to allow anything that increased my public profile.”Donovan said she was fired earlier this year even though her contract was supposed to go through the end of 2024.In an email to GBH News, Sofiya Cabalquinto, a spokesperson for the Harvard Kennedy School, said that Donovan was never fired and that the complaint’s allegations of unfair treatment and donor interference are false.Cabalquinto added that all research projects at Harvard Kennedy School need to be led by faculty members and that Donovan was hired as a staff member, not a faculty member.“When the original faculty leader of the project left Harvard, the School tried for some time to identify another faculty member who had time and interest to lead the project,” Cabalquinto said. “After that effort did not succeed, the project was given more than a year to wind down.”Cabalquinto said the Harvard Kennedy School also denied that it allowed Facebook to dictate its approach to research.While at Harvard, Donovan said she fundraised and received millions in grants, including $1 million from Craigslist founder Craig Newmark.In the complaint, she alleges that Harvard kept all of the money she raised.She said she hopes that different entities and agencies dig into Harvard's relationship with donors and audit the funding she raised to see where that money has gone since she was terminated.“The last thing I hope for is that I'm the first of many,” she said. “I'm hoping that other whistleblowers who have had to deal with tech companies soft and hard influencing their research in different ways come forward and we can, as a field, move together in a better direction.”The Massachusetts attorney general’s office has received the complaint and is currently reviewing it.","Article","Harvard whistleblower Joan Donovan files complaint against her former employer"

Maura Healey's desk Monday and she immediately signed it.House Democrats were able to get a quorum of members together to push through a compromise on a long-overdue package they failed to wrap up before the Legislature shifted into a seven-week holiday stretch of informal sessions.Republicans in the House successfully stalled the bill on Thursday, Friday and Saturday by pointing out that not enough lawmakers were present to constitute a quorum, but enough Democrats ventured to the State House on Monday to get the bill through that branch.The House adopted the compromise bill on a hand-counted 105-14 vote, and the Senate followed through several hours later with a 20-3 vote. Both branches then gave the measure final approval on unrecorded voice votes, sending it to Healey.The bill includes critical funds to fulfill state employee raises, which had already been collectively bargained and ratified, as well as $250 million to try and keep pace with unprecedented demand on the emergency shelter system.""I'm proud to sign this supplemental budget that dedicates critical funding for hard-earned raises for workers, supports municipalities with covering the costs of special education and flood relief, sustains our Emergency Assistance program, and more. I'm grateful to our colleagues in the Legislature for their partnership,"" Healey said in a statement.The bill also schedules the next statewide primary for Sept. 3, 2024, directs money to school districts facing increased special education costs, transfers money to address the state's unfunded pension liability, and more.Language to facilitate a New England Revolution stadium in Everett was dropped from the final compromise, but top Democrats in the House and Senate say the idea, which has won favor in both branches at different points, remains under consideration.Stuttered progress on the bill in recent weeks set off a whirlwind of finger-pointing. Despite a light fall agenda, Democrats failed to agree among themselves on the bill before formal sessions for the year ended Nov. 15, opening the door for Republicans who disliked the bill's approach to shelter crisis management.Senate Republicans could have tried to delay the bill on Monday, but agreed to let it proceed while recording their opposition.""We could have gone down that road,"" said Republican Sen. Peter Durant of Spencer, the chamber's newest member who on the campaign trail was a vocal critic of the state's emergency shelter management. But Democrats could have used parliamentary tactics of their own in response, he said, and ultimately pushed the bill through on an unrecorded voice vote.""This was a better option to us that you could be at least heard, at least semi-recorded,"" Durant said after the session.The bill's signing will allow the state comptroller to start closing the financial books for the fiscal year that ended June 30.Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair Michael Rodrigues, his chamber's lead negotiator on the measure, told his colleagues that Monday's action could put worker raises in effect for the holiday season -- and he blamed the House for preventing retroactive pay from taking effect before the new year.""I've been told in my conversations with the administration that if we complete the work today and get this budget to the governor, those employees will be able to see their raises in the paychecks that come out on Dec. 22, before the Christmas holiday,"" Rodrigues said in a speech from the Senate floor. ""Wouldn't that be a great thing? Unfortunately, because of the delay down the hall, they will not be able to receive the retroactive pay that they will be entitled to. That will come in early January.""The governor kicked off debate by filing her own closeout budget on Sept. 13 with a request to steer $250 million more into the evolving emergency shelter crisis fueled in part by a massive increase in migrants arriving in Massachusetts.House Democrats did not advance their own version for nearly two months, and the two branches were unable to reconcile differences in their approaches as formal sessions for the year drew to a close.Republicans in that chamber prevented the late-arriving compromise from advancing on three successive days last week, prompting House Speaker Ron Mariano to contend they were obstructing the measure because ""they want to seem to be relevant.""GOP leaders have opposed the latest infusion of funding into the emergency shelter system, which brings the total amount for FY24 up to about $575 million. Democrats have said they expect the additional money to last into the spring, but not the entirety of the fiscal year.""We all know the funding in this bill is just the tip of the iceberg which will ultimately crowd out spending in other areas absent serious and meaningful reforms,"" said House Minority Leader Brad Jones.""The Democrats are trying to promote a false narrative laying the blame on our caucus for holding up final action on the closeout budget for the last few days,"" he said in a statement on behalf of his caucus. ""The reality is the Democrats delayed action on this bill for nearly two months, failed to reach an agreement before formal sessions ended on November 15, and did not produce a conference committee report until November 30, exactly eleven weeks after Governor Healey first filed the bill.""Lawmakers once sought to close the state's financial books in the late summer or fall, but in recent years, the Democrat supermajorities have worked at a glacial pace. The fiscal 2023 closeout budget becomes the second-latest to win enactment since the turn of the century, according to data tracked by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, lagging only fiscal year 2019, which the Legislature approved on Dec. 12, 2019.Republicans pushed unsuccessfully for the Legislature to reconvene a formal session, where the final compromise bill could receive a roll call vote and debate. Legislative rules call for informal-only sessions for the final seven weeks in the first year of the session.The Senate adopted a GOP-backed order that would allow a rare holiday-season formal session to consider the closeout budget, but the House never took action on the proposal, preventing it from having any effect.""We wanted to make sure the public was aware of what was going on and we were taking a stand to say, 'You can't operate this way,'"" said Republican Sen. Ryan Fattman of Sutton.[Sam Doran contributed reporting.]","Article","Healey signs overdue $3.1B closeout budget"

The driver was unhurt, officials said.At the peak, more than 25,000 homes and businesses in Maine and more than 11,000 in Vermont were without electricity as trees and branches laden with heavy, wet snow fell on power lines, officials said. Temperatures were hovering close to freezing across much of northern New England.The National Weather Service declared the first winter storm warning of the season for New Hampshire and western Maine. Northernmost Vermont was also under a winter storm warning Monday. Far northern Maine, also under a warning, already saw heavy snow before Thanksgiving.Some mountainous areas of western Maine and New Hampshire could see over a foot of snow. Vermont was expected to get closer to 8 inches (20 centimeters).The snow made for a messy, slushy commute in many places. Many communities in northern New England had school delays and closures for the day.","Article","Heavy snowfall drops tree branches onto power lines, causing outages in New England"

We'll see when the Senate takes it up, and what their gameplan is, and then we'll judge when it comes back,"" House Minority Leader Brad Jones said after the House vote. ""This I think has highlighted the dysfunction on Beacon Hill, highlighted the shortcomings of a one-party monopoly on Beacon Hill.""The bill (H 4204) was drafted by a six-member conference committee. If the bill is surfaced in the Senate Monday it will face an up-or-down vote there as well. After conference committee reports are accepted in each branch, enactment votes are also needed in each branch in order to move any bill to the governor's desk. The House was in recess Monday afternoon, awaiting the bill's possible return.If Senate Republicans wish to hold up the bill, that branch has a non-debatable ""lay on the table"" motion that is available to members and has been used in the past to slow bills down, usually until Democrats rule that such motions are dilatory and power past them.Senate Republicans so far have not had a chance to formally weigh in on the conference committee bill, but they appear to have at least one maneuver at the ready.All four members of the Senate's GOP caucus cosponsored an order seeking to clear the way for a formal session, which could feature debate and roll call votes, to consider the closeout supplemental budget deal.Legislative rules call for informal sessions, where debate is not allowed, from mid-November through December in odd-numbered years.Formal sessions for the year ended Nov. 15 and are not set to resume until Jan. 3, 2024 under legislative rules, but the proposed order would carve out an exception for the $3.1 billion spending bill.House Republicans offered a similar order last week, and Democrats quickly shelved it by burying it in the Rules Committee.","Article","Mass.

In a letter to House and Senate leaders and released publicly, Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young warned the U.S. will run out of funding to send weapons and assistance to Ukraine by the end of the year, saying that would ""kneecap"" Ukraine on the battlefield. She added that the U.S. already has run out of money that it has used to prop up Ukraine's economy, and ""if Ukraine's economy collapses, they will not be able to keep fighting, full stop."" ""We are out of money — and nearly out of time,"" she wrote. Biden has sought a nearly $106 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other needs, but it has faced a difficult reception on Capitol Hill, where there is growing skepticism about the magnitude of assistance for Ukraine and where even Republicans supportive of the funding are insisting on U.S.-Mexico border policy changes to halt the flow of migrants as a condition for the assistance. Meanwhile, the GOP-controlled House has passed a standalone assistance package for Israel, which is fighting a war with Hamas in Gaza, while the White House has maintained that all of the priorities must be met. Congress already has allocated $111 billion to assist Ukraine, including $67 billion in military procurement funding, $27 billion for economic and civil assistance and $10 billion for humanitarian aid. Young wrote that all of it, other than about 3% of the military funding, had been depleted by mid-November. The Biden administration has said it has slowed the pace of some military assistance to Kyiv in recent weeks to try to stretch supplies until Congress approves more funding. ""We are out of money to support Ukraine in this fight,"" Young wrote. ""This isn't a next year problem. The time to help a democratic Ukraine fight against Russian aggression is right now. It is time for Congress to act."" The letter followed a classified Capitol Hill briefing on Nov. 29 for the top House and Senate leaders on the need for the assistance. Defense and other national security officials briefed the ""big four"" congressional leaders as Congress is debating President Joe Biden's nearly $106 billion funding package, which includes $61 billion for Ukraine but has become snared by Republican demands for U.S.-Mexico border security changes. ""They were clear that Ukraine needs the aid soon — and so does our military need the aid soon,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told The Associated Press in an interview. Copyright 2023 NPR.
